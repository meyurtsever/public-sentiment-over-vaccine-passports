8,8,8,0,1638629678,"The process was one of ‘debasing themselves’. ‘Definitely you feel the indignity,’ he says. ‘When you start doing that over time, it changes you.’ It breaks down human relations into a ‘transactional’ state, he says. &lt;img class=""responsive lazy-image__img article-body-image__source"" src=""/content/dam/world-news/2021/11/30/Red-Roulette-Whitney-and-Desmond_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqMcMAF0Ek3tvPCqahlC6JU0r20To26NFuragGj_rUwF8.jpeg?imwidth=480"" alt=""Whitney and Desmond"" loading=""lazy"" width=""1988"" height=""1243""/&gt;  Together, Duan and Shum rose from nothing to become gatekeepers at the highest levels of power and amassed a fortune worth billions He and Duan were always serving the hierarchy. Part of that meant buying just the right gift at the right time, from $300,000 in medical expenses for one official, to a $10,000 watch, a private jet trip to a French Rothschild vineyard or a pair of fur-lined boots for the minister of a snowy region. I put it to Shum that we have a name for this in the West: corruption. He was an enthusiastic participant in this system, yet now he’s playing the warrior against it. Isn’t he a hypocrite? ‘I’m no warrior,’ he says dismissively. As for the other charges: ‘I don’t care… You can say I’m a hypocrite, I’m a good person, I’m a bad person, whatever, I don’t mind.’ All he is, he says, is a witness. Shum maintains that he and Duan never paid bribes. They were simply giving tokens of ‘proper respect’. ‘We are definitely peddling influence, but we don’t need to bribe people,’ he says of that period. ‘[These officials] can easily get a million, tens of millions somewhere else but they’re not asking them from me because they want to reserve their access to the Wen family for some other purpose.’ Their purpose, he says, was not traditional corruption, like government contracts, but tips for promotion or gossip on internal politics at the top of the party. As to the rights and wrongs of it, Shum largely suspended his judgment. At the time, ‘I very much [saw] myself as a student, trying to adopt what is the practice in China.’ What’s more, he felt that the system was getting better: ‘I was thinking I’m a participant in this betterment, I’m contributing.’ He was also getting very rich – or, at least, his wife was, since most assets were in her name. He says, ‘I get to a stage where I can own anything I wish.’ He bought a Ferrari and a private jet. He and Duan flew around the world to find the perfect $500,000 jade bracelet. They needed to prove to those of ‘noble birth’ that they, too, belonged. Shum won’t say how much he is worth now, other than saying he is ‘comfortable’. He claims he doesn’t miss being in the billionaire league. Once the novelty wears off, he says, ‘it’s just a normal part of your life… You realise it doesn’t mean that much.’ All this success and optimism culminated in the ultimate moment of hubris: Shum and others began to believe they could nudge the system in a more liberal, democratic direction. He started a charity to award scholarships to disadvantaged youth and set up a think tank to foster civil society. He didn’t realise it at the time, but this was the high point of China’s journey towards freedom. After 2008, everything changed. The route back to oppression How liberal hopes for China were dashed   2008 Beijing hosts the Summer Olympic Games at the high point of hopes for liberalisation, with China’s economy still booming 2012 Xi Jinping assumes leadership, begins a huge purge of the Communist Party and ramps up disappearances of activists and government critics   2018 Xi changes the constitution to remove the limit of rulership to two five-year terms, effectively allowing him to rule for life 2020 China’s new national security law in Hong Kong sparks protests. In China, disappearances reach an estimated 39-58,000 people For Duan, the fear of falling never fully went away. ‘You’re climbing a cliff,’ says Shum of her rise. ‘You dig your nails all the way into the rock.’ Duan had nothing to fall back on – no illustrious family, no foreign passport. She tried to plan for the future, cultivating not just the Wens, but several younger, rising officials. It wasn’t enough. In 2012, The New York Times published an investigation into the fabulous wealth of the Wen family, which named Duan, damaging her and them. Shum believes that the piece was a political hit-job planted by an enemy of Wen’s. The journalist, David Barboza, denies this and says he spent a year hunting down documents after hearing rumours about the Wens. Either way, after 2008, Chinese politics took an oppressive turn. The financial crisis convinced the elites that the Western model was nothing to envy and the Communist Party turned from liberalisation back to focusing on control and power. This shift facilitated the rise of an especially ruthless, authoritarian official called Xi Jinping. Xi, a son of the Maoist aristocracy, began his rule in 2012 with an ‘anti-corruption’ purge so extensive that Shum, who had at first supported the campaign, concluded Xi was making himself a dictator for life. ‘When you arrest that many people – you’re talking about 10 million people who are your enemies – you can’t step down. The moment you do, the backlash will overwhelm you,’ says Shum. So complete is Xi’s purge that Shum believes if the 68-year-old died tomorrow, there would be such a serious a power vacuum it could split the party. Shum became convinced it was time to pack up and move their lives out of China. Duan disagreed. In 2015, he left with Ariston. Within two years, Duan had disappeared. Despite his composure, there is a quiet anger to Shum. He and Duan devoted their lives to learning the rules of the game, building a business empire and developing China in the process. He clearly believes they operated as cleanly as possible. But in the end, that was no protection – they weren’t of the right ‘bloodline’ and in a system ruled by fear, no friends or allies were willing to help. &lt;img class=""responsive lazy-image__img article-body-image__source"" src=""/content/dam/world-news/2021/11/30/TELEMMGLPICT000241912579_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNHPnaojp5PseXVWAlSJjp5-sjRhQesoLpbbz3DnpHdo.jpeg?imwidth=480"" alt=""Chinese president Xi Jinping"" loading=""lazy"" width=""2500"" height=""1563""/&gt; Chinese president Xi Jinping swiftly cracks down on anything that might pose a challenge, jailing political rivals and silencing dissent CREDIT: Zhang Ling/Xinhua via AP   Now, Shum sees the Communist Party extending its power and influence around the world. Those who claim that the party may be benign or that we can engage with it positively are deeply misguided, he believes. ‘They want submission of all countries,’ he says. That means, for example, if a country won’t vote to install China’s candidate at the UN, it will be punished in another area, just as Australian trade was sanctioned for demanding an investigation into Covid. ‘Are you willing to live in that world?’ he asks. Fundamentally, the party sees the success of democracies as a threat. ‘As long as you insist on prospering and thriving, their model is not that great,’ he says. That is why Xi wants to ‘take out’ Taiwan and stamp out all talk of ‘universal values’. I ask whether China will become the biggest economy in the world, as trends suggest. ‘It won’t happen,’ he says immediately. But that hasn’t stopped China enthusiasts in the UK from pushing for closer relations. When Shum published his book, he sent it to several senior British politician friends. ‘They’ve never responded. They don’t want to associate with me – they still want to make some bucks in China,’ he says. Is he talking about people who are in government today? He hesitates. ‘Yeah,’ he says. ‘Sort of, yeah.’ Shum will never go back to China. But he has had enough of running and hiding. In his book, he describes how he was once among those Hong Kongers co-opted by Beijing to serve its interests: ‘We all went along with a system we knew was wrong because to do otherwise would have cost us – and everyone around us – their livelihood, freedom and who knows, even their lives. The price just seemed too high.’ It is a price that Shum has now decided he is willing to pay.

Be aware if they have any Chinese documentation they will be seen as property of the state and dual citizenship will not be recognized.

It's not necessarily seeing it as wrong, it's more people being frustrated with the policy, as it essentially means you need to make a choice: Stay in China or Leave China. And it's not that easy a choice. Staying because you have a good career going or built your life here, also means not being able to travel to see your family for potentially several more years (it's already been 2 btw). Leaving means potentially being unable to come back for several years, and thus being forced to go back and restart your life and career.  This is in stark contrast with other countries, where travel has at least been made manageable for people who do wish to go see their family, even though there are still restrictions in place like vaccination passport, facemasks, etc. (depends on each country obviously).   Mainland China is by far one of the harshest quarantines you have to go through both in terms of time and cost. There's no consistency across the country either, with people having to do double quarantines, or in terms of quality of hotel.  So it's a subject ""wrong"".

They took my passport and assigned me a police officer who I had to call almost every other day and ask permission to do stuff around the city. They put me under complete surveillance and I would notice police officers parked outside my place (I was in an old lane house so this was even weirder). All in all the “investigation” took over 9 months of my life. During that time it was hard to work, and bring in money. It was terrible. A slow burn on my finances. The lawyers were absolutely useless too. They said they can’t do anything during this stage because I was “officially convicted” I was in a weird legal grey area for 9 months of my life were I was being punished for a crime I never committed. Only reason I escaped this hellhole was because covid hit and I was able to negotiate release due to humanitarian concerns for my well-being and safety. After I was finally released without any charges it finally dawned on me what was really happening.

By Qiao Long and Emily Chan 2021-08-06 Email story Comment on this story Share Print story      Print     Share     Comment     Email  China Stops Issuing New Passports, Slaps Entry, Exit Curbs on Citizens A man is shown holding Chinese travel documents in a file photo. Reuters  China has stopped issuing new passports to its citizens and has imposed entry and exit controls on its population, citing the recent surge in the Delta variant of COVID-19, but commentators say the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is using the pandemic as a pretext to curb freedom of movement.  Chinese nationals living in mainland China have told RFA in recent months that the authorities have gradually stopped issuing new passports and exit visas -- a police-approved travel permit that adds another layer to a slew of hurdles Chinese nationals must clear in order to be allowed to leave.  The Chinese Entry and Exit Bureau recently confirmed publicly that the rules are in place, saying exit permits will only be issued for ""essential"" travel.  ""We will be implementing a strict approvals systems with no permits for non-emergency or non-essential trips out of China, to ensure public safety during the pandemic,"" spokesman Chen Jie told a news conference on July 30.  Some Chinese nationals living in the United States have been stranded in China after they combined a trip home with plans to renew their soon-to-expire passports at the same time, U.S.-based businessman Zhang Shengqi told RFA.  ""My friend ... found he couldn't get [a passport] after he got back, and his wife [in the U.S.] just gave birth to a child,"" Zhang said, suggesting that even returning to one's place of work and family wasn't being regarded as ""essential.""  ""My friend even has contacts in the area, but even they can't get it done for him; nobody is issuing them, so he is stuck there and can't get out,"" he said. ""It's pretty inhumane when families can't be together.""  Chinese nationals have also drawn a blank when trying to apply to renew passports at the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles, Zhang said.  ""There are a few people here whose passports have now expired, yet [the consulate] are saying that none of these applications are urgent,"" he said. ""They are refusing to renew them.""  ""They are planning to hire a lawyer and sue the LA consulate,"" he said.  Pandemic used as a pretext  Current affairs commentator Fang Yuan said the pandemic probably isn't the main reason for the new restrictions, however.  ""I think we can look at these new entry and exit restrictions in the context of the crackdown on Chinese companies listing in the U.S.,"" Fang said. ""These choices are being made in line with the [Sino-U.S.] trade war.""  ""These actions may cause some harm to [Chinese interests], but they are also hurting the other side,"" he said.  U.S.-based legal scholar Teng Biao said Chinese nationals should be granted the freedom to enter and leave China at will, under the constitution, Chinese passport law, and immigration legislation.  ""I think the Chinese Entry-Exit Bureau's actions are in violation of laws protecting the basic rights of citizens,"" Teng told RFA. ""The pandemic is being used as a pretext.""  ""They want to ... clamp down on the movement of their citizens and prevent Western ideological imports from influencing them,"" he said.

30,30,30,2,1631241546,"I have heard rumours of this a month ago. I used this reason to encourage my mother to apply for Canadian citizenship (she is a Chinese national, presently in Canada with a valid permanent resident card, but her Chinese passport expired a month and a half ago). But she is still very hesitant to do so, fearing that having Canadian citizenship would negatively affect her ability to sell her (worthless) Chinese real-estate holdings.  Unfortunately, Xi Jinping's attempt at Cultural Revolution 2.0 means separating China from the rest of the world and that includes gross infringements of human rights. Remember, in a normal country, regardless of your status, if there is not a warrant out for your arrest, you should be allowed to leave. That applies to both citizens and foreigners.  The rumour I heard is that if you are going to apply for or renew a passport for travel (for tourism purposes) or get a study permit (to study abroad), you will get refused. If you go to work, they will allow you to go ahead. The first 2 involve spending money and the third one involves earning money. People intending to immigrate may fall into the former group, as understood by the Chinese government. As for Chinese citizens who already have permanent resident status in another country who return to China for short trips, I am not sure if border officers will allow them to fly back to the country in which they have status. There are no news pieces I came across where Chinese officials ban overseas citizens from leaving to go back to the US/Canada/Australia/UK/New Zealand, etc... But at the same time, I would not be surprised if they start doing that in the future.  I am about to take the slippery slope argument to the extreme, and make the assertion that this is going to cause a massive international crisis that will destroy China's relationship with the West, especially the United Kingdom and Canada, and here is why.  If it is true that China is not issuing passports to citizens who apply for them, and being that both Hong Kong and Macau are parts of China, then China will make these governments to do the same to their citizens + permanent residents (people are only eligible for a passport there if they are both Chinese citizens and have permanent resident status in one of those special administrative regions). Beijing can change the 1997 explanation to Section 9 of the Nationality Act and ban dual citizenship in Hong Kong and Macau and force the existing dual citizens to choose between China and the other country. The basic principle of travel for a dual citizen is that you enter and exit a country using the same passport--specifically, if you are entering and exiting a country in which you are a citizen, use that country's passport. If you are a Hong Kong (Chinese) citizen and a Canadian citizen and you are in Hong Kong, your probably used a HKIC or HKSAR passport to enter. You use your HKSAR passport to leave Hong Kong when going through exit immigration but inform the airline that you have a Canadian passport. Prior to landing, you also provide proof of vaccination for COVID-19 on the ArriveCAN app (has to be Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca or J&amp;J and the last vaccination took place at least 14 days prior to landing). Upon landing in a Canadian airport, you present the data on ArriveCAN and your Canadian passport and are granted entry.  There were as many as 300 000 Canadian citizens in Hong Kong--a city of 7.5 million. Now, if China makes HK and Macau stop issuing passports so that Hong Kong residents who have Canadian citizenship cannot leave the island to return to Canada (a constitutional violation according to the Constitution Act of 1982 in Canada), then obviously, it would be hugely problematic. Presenting a Canadian passport to Hong Kong exit immigration may be tantamount to falsely confessing to illegal immigration (how did you enter Hong Kong and overstay your 90 day visa free access privileges as a Canadian citizen?).  The same kind of problem would exist for anyone with BN(O) passports. If someone has an expired HKSAR passport but a valid BN(O) passport and intend to immigrate to the United Kingdom may be banned from using BN(O) to leave the city.  /End rant",China,t5_2qh2v,/r/China/comments/pl57xo/china_stops_issuing_new_passports_slaps_entry/hc9ikle/

Train stations and hotels is about the only place this happens.   Once an inspector on the train got all difficult about it, I just insisted I arrived before the pandemic and he gave up and left me alone. Felt a bit embarrassed by it but no major drama.   The second time was a bit worse. I took a train from a small city that had some cases, I still had a green code though. When I arrived they were checking everyone who got off that train and my passport without a stamp wasn't in their ring binder I guess. After arguing to each other about how they were supposed to deal with me, they made me get a covid test at a little tent outside the station.

So there is a plausible argument that the CCP is restricting new travelers to stem a growing tide of political emigrants, in which case we would expect passport issuance to open up once a new system for screening outbound travelers has been established.  On the other hand, the US also paused passport issuance for a few weeks when Covid blew up last year because they needed to restructure to allow distanced work.

57,57,57,0,1615569054,"Right...  Well, [there's this](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/02/asia/xinjiang-china-karakax-document-intl-hnk/), a leaked Xinjiang government document, listing reasons why people were sent to camps. In some cases, it was religiosity, but ordinary religiosity, like going to the mosque (which is legal and run by the government of China) and saying daily prayers. But in other cases, it had nothing at all to do with religion: traveling abroad (or, paradoxically, NOT traveling abroad but holding a passport), having family members who were under suspicion, having family members who traveled abroad, having too many children, reading too many books. Men were taken for having beards. On that last one: some wumaos here have said that this is just China extending what it was already doing with the One Child Policy to Uyghurs, so nothing to see here, right? But as the article notes, Han women weren't generally jailed or sent to camps for violating that policy (as awful as it already was). Normally, the penalty was just a fine.  If you doubt the authenticity of this leak, consider this. While the Chinese government didn't confirm its authenticity, *it didn't deny it either*. Whenever they've been pressed on *specific examples* of leaked documents, they always refuse to ""confirm or deny."" You'd think that if it was a forgery, they'd be chomping on the bit, finding ways to expose it as such, and thereby embarrass the human rights community. Thus far, they have not. This article is from May 2020.  As for the second claim, I'll just refer you to any coverage of Xinjiang in Chinese state media, where it's claimed that of course, they are respectful of Islam and religious liberty. [Random example:](http://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202103/12/WS604ac246a31024ad0baaeb5a.html)  *China is a country ruled by law. The government cracks down on all kinds of illegal and criminal activities in accordance with the law, and the illegal and criminal activities carried out by using religion are no exception. In the fight against crime, there has never been a specific religion that has been targeted.*  So, that's your dilemma. Either it's the case that it's good that China is trying to stamp out Islam, in which case, you're accusing China of lying. Or, they aren't trying to stamp out Islam, in which case, your justification for the camps isn't sustainable. Take your pick.  As for your Curveball reference, this seems to be an example of the [""Media Got it Wrong Before"" fallacy](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Media_was_wrong_before). It's usually sufficient to merely point out that an argument is fallacious (in this case, the fact that media got something wrong before doesn't mean they are wrong in *this* case, which would require you to demonstrate how they're wrong).   But I'll go further. In the case of claims about Iraqi WMD, the sources media relied on were generally US intelligence agencies, who had a desired policy outcome, and allowed cognitive bias to read ambiguous data to favor that outcome. In the case of what we're seeing here, none of the sources are coming from the US, UK, German, French, etc. governments or their intelligence agencies. They're coming from refugees themselves, shoeleather journalists, independent researchers and data geeks, and leaked government documents. There also doesn't seem to be a specific desired policy agenda, mainly because there isn't much specifically that the US or other governments can do about this problem. With Iraq, there was a desired policy - war. I've yet to see any Uyghur activist or even the most militant of anti-China hawks argue for war with China. There seems to be some general consensus about using the Magnitsky Act against Xinjiang officials, boycotting goods that can be traced to Xinjiang, and boycotting the 2022 Winter Olympics. I've [seen a few argue](https://supchina.com/2021/02/11/asylum-for-the-uyghurs/) that the US should make it easier for Uyghur refugees to come to the US. But inventing an entire genocide out of holecloth for those modest policy outcomes seems kind of like overkill. It's just not plausible. If anything, what I'm seeing from China policy folks is a sense of frustration, in that it seems the reality of this genocide isn't something that they can ignore, as a matter of morality, but it's a major obstacle to working out diplomatic solutions to other issues that the US, Canada, UK, etc., would desperately like to resolve with China, particularly as the world economy recovers from the Covid crisis. And that tracks: reality doesn't always give us what we'd want or what would be convenient, and if anything, we should be more suspicious when it seems to, because that often means there's something we've missed. In this case, because this is very much something that no one wants, and no one benefits from, that makes more likely that the media is getting it right. I'll also note that, unlike reporting on Iraq, there doesn't seem to be any kind of partisan split there. Whether we're looking at far right sources (Breitbart), right-of-center (WSJ, Fox), moderate to center-left (CNN), leftish (NYT, Atlantic), to far left (Jacobin), the reporting has been pretty consistent on this. Whereas I could point you to plenty of media in 2002 that was highly skeptical of the case for the Iraq War. Thus far, the only media that seems to be supporting the case for denialism is Chinese state media.",China,t5_2qh2v,/r/China/comments/m35sp8/is_communist_china_losing_control_of_the_uighur/gqpj5nd/

They did not care to hear what I was trying to tell them, which was ""help me charge my phone so I can scan the code"" and ""I haven't left China in 4 years"".

Once my code showed I never left, they all laughed it off and I was on my way. They're laughing but not a good experience for me.      There is a second situation that is borderline racist me and my friend experienced recently. I was taking my friend around to find an apartment to rent, and to note, we were always wearing masks. He's an ABC and hasn't left China for at least two years now. Once the landlords or security guards hear he's an American you can immediately see they become uncomfortable. The masks come out (they weren't usually wearing masks) and they take a few steps to the side. On at least three occasions the landlord actually decided on the spot not to rent to him. What we always did, and I feel we shouldn't have to, is explain to them that he's never left China.   I suppose we can consider ourselves fortunate because we are not white, brown or black. I can't imagine what someone of a different skin color is going through recently. I've seen pockets of how locals cover their mouths/noses with their hands because a foreigner is around. It makes my blood boil because imo I think they usually do it just to make the foreigner feel uncomfortable. If they're so confident to walk around without a mask then why use such big hand gestures when a foreigner is around?  Also, I've seen mothers do with their children what OP had described. It's appalling. If you can teach your children such negative sentiments towards foreigners then surely you can teach your kids not to urinate in front of the hospital entrances!

Xi Jinping is really Mao Zedong 2.0.  So, the Chinese government is really trying to make sure they are isolated. If you are a Chinese citizen in China, you will likely be banned from leaving (passport issuance in 2020 is down an astonishing 98% from 2019, from 16.5 million to just 330 000). If you are a Chinese citizen overseas trying to return, they make you isolate for 21 days even if fully vaccinated by a western vaccine (2 shots for Pfizer **or** Moderna **or** AstraZeneca **or** 1 shot for Johnson and Johnson) + 14 days. This makes a vacation to visit family impossible without extensive paid time off or outright termination from your job in the other country even if you are exempt from quarantine upon return to that other country. If you are a naturalized citizen in that country, you are prohibited from entering China because China has a one-citizenship policy (except for Hong Kong and Macau residents).  On the other hand, they are now promoting such extreme policies to make their citizens less connected to the international community (which severely hurts their economy because it makes any kind of international transaction much, much more difficult). They are wasting valuable time where the children can learn one of the most widely used languages on Earth, and indoctrinating them with extreme cult-of-personality statements (just like they did in Mao Zedong's time). According to my mother, in school, they kept having to praise Mao (whereas I did not have to keep praising Hu Jintao when I was in school and he was president). Within generations, China will regress into the way it was 60 years ago, which is exactly what it doesn't need, because it is already facing imminent collapse due to population decline pressures.  No wonder, the Hong Kongers saw this coming to them. In 2020, according to the Education Bureau, a whopping 15400 students dropped out of school in Hong Kong (out of 705000 students), which is to say that more than 2% of students who attended school in 2019 are no longer doing so. Why are students dropping out? Of course, their parents are taking the kids out of school, quitting their jobs, selling their homes and cars, and using the money to buy a one way ticket to Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States to start their new lives. This is before the British government started allowing British National (Overseas) passport holders to resettle in the United Kingdom. This number will be even more horrifying in 2021 when the data comes out in August 2022.  Honestly, I feel very scared for my nieces and nephew (the children of my first cousins) in China. Their country is doing things that will transform them into crazy people and I think that with this kind of indoctrination, they may grow up and come to view us (my mother, my sister and her son) as ""enemies"" to be hated just because we live in Canada. The other thing: the fact that my sister's son (a native-born Canadian) speaks Cantonese better than my cousins' children pisses me to no end.

111,1,1,1,1643273923,"Here are the low-down, from my recent experience.  1. Within 2 days before your board the plane, get the Covid test. Make sure you don't have a weekend between the test and you leaving — then the 2 days over Sunday (where labs are closed) is a non-started.  In such case, you'd have to pay much dollars for a same-day result. 2. (actually, the stupid cert that the foreign clinic produced can be forged easily, so it is a stupid thing to require that) 3. The website you apply for is basically for home Quarantine, otherwise, you'd be assigned a center to do your quarantine — hotel, or MOH's god-forsaken dorm centers. 4. So, to apply for home quarantine, you will have to prep before hand:    1. Get low-res photos of the house (outside &amp; in) you plan to quarantine in    2. Get low-res images of your Covid vaccination certs, passports, IC    3. From the US, go to this website, [https://hso.moh.gov.my](https://hso.moh.gov.my)    4. You can only apply for this home quarantine no more than X days before your flight. 5. Once it is approved, you will be given an email.  Save that email, as you will need to show that to the MOH person at KLIA (I don't know about other airports). This email can came to you on the day you fly, or when you are in transit.  How's that for tension? 6. Why low-res images?  The fackers who developed the web-site placed a size restriction on the uploads per file (250Kb).  You better be a tech person who can deal with shrinking file sizes, etc.  Those damn facking facks . 7. Once you land in the KLIA, you will be taken on a bus to the quarantine area.  On the bus, you will see QR codes.  Get started on entering the data they need, while the rest of the passengers just stand there like dummies.  If you have many flights coming at the same time, this time saved can get you through the queues quicker. 8. Get your ticket, and passport ready, as you will need to furnish some data through the website.  Enter those data in darkness while you sway inside the bus. 9. When you finally get to the counters, they will check your data you entered already, your MOH home quarantine order, COVID results, MySejahtera (if you have it) or vaccination certificates, blah blah blah. 10. If all in order, you go through another Covid test, and they give you a lanyard. 11. You clear Immigration, then get to the MOH counters where they take your lanyard and then put some sort of wrist band tracker thinjamajig. 12. I think then, you clear immigration and customs after that.  ps. I don't know if these processes are changed from country-to-country.  I was coming back from the US.

The average person who has died from Covid already has 4 comorbidities (CDC data). UK estimates people who ACTUALLY died only from Covid to be about 50,000. Covid is a disease of the aged &amp;  immunocompromised. When was the last time KKM told you to eat well, get enough sunlight, exercise and boost your natural immune system?   \- The virus is real but the response of governments all over the world from the start of the pandemic has been unprecedented and a vast overreach of powers. It is clear, even as recent as today from Denmark, that lockdowns kill economies more effectively than it prevents Covid spread. If lockdowns worked, then everyone in the UAE (which has not had a lockdown since June 2020) should have caught Covid and died by now.  \- Goalposts keep changing. They took your fundamental human right freedoms under the guise of keeping you safe. Then they said you'll get your freedoms back when you get vaccinated. Then they said not good enough, get boosted. No one knows how the goalpost will change next.  That is all.

Below is the article (not OP link)     **Hidden camera reveals 'appalling' conditions in overseas PPE factory supplying Canadian hospitals, expert says**Posted: Jan 15, 2021 4:00 AM ET | Last Updated: January 17  As global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) surges during the pandemic, so has the human cost for those making it overseas, an investigation by CBC’s Marketplace has found.  *Hidden camera footage inside the world's largest glove manufacturer in Malaysia shows several employees working in close quarters. Shortly after, there was a massive COVID-19 outbreak that led to nearly 6,000 infections. (Name withheld)*  The wall of noise is constant as the workers manually check, sort and pack a seemingly endless supply of disposable gloves into boxes destined for international markets like Canada.  The production line, filled mostly with migrant workers, is cramped. Yet COVID-19 protocols like sanitizing, physical distancing or mask-wearing, meant to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, don't seem to be enforced at this Malaysian factory.  ""They just want \[you\] to work. They just want product. They don't care about the worker,"" said one employee from Nepal, who works 12 hours every day.  In spite of these health risks, some employees say they can't leave their jobs. They say they have significant debt — often borrowed at the hands of unscrupulous lenders — having paid recruitment agencies massive fees to line them up for their jobs.  ""I don't have any choice, I have to work \[to pay off my debt\],"" said another worker from Bangladesh, who makes around $3 an hour and is paying back loans two years after starting his job.  As global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) surges during the pandemic, so has the human cost for those making it overseas, an investigation by CBC's Marketplace has found.  The investigation into the global PPE trade revealed that some of the life-saving equipment Canadian health-care workers are using appears to be made in sweatshop-like conditions — raising doubts about Canada's commitment to international human rights and its ability to prevent unethically sourced goods from entering the country.  Workers at the Top Glove factory in Malaysia wait in line to be tested for COVID-19 following a plantwide outbreak in November. (Reuters)  ""We can say without doubt that the \[glove\] industry remains a hotbed of systemic forced labour and modern slavery,"" said Andy Hall, an international migrant worker rights specialist based in Southeast Asia. ""\[Migrant workers\] are not seen as human beings…. They're often treated as second-class citizens and systemically abused.""  Several Canadian companies that have tens of millions of dollars in PPE contracts with the federal government imported goods from the Malaysian manufacturers Marketplace investigated.  ""Canada is tainted and Canada is complicit in this abuse that's going on,"" said Hall.  ***How unethically sourced PPE could be ending up in some Canadian hospitals | Marketplace***    Marketplace spoke to nearly two dozen employees at disposable glove factories in Malaysia who say they face unsafe work and living conditions and violence on the job. Many of these goods could be making their way into the Canadian health-care system. 3:13  Canada, through import laws, prohibits the entry of goods that are produced with forced labour, which according to the International Labour Organization (ILO) can include such indicators as debt bondage, restriction of movement, excessive overtime and poor living conditions.  Yet according to records reviewed by Marketplace, millions of disposable gloves manufactured by Malaysian companies in conditions that experts say have the hallmarks of forced labour have come into our ports.  Hidden camera footage also showed unsafe working and poor living conditions inside a Malaysian factory, which Hall described as ""really, really appalling"" after viewing the video.  ***Hidden camera reveals where some of your PPE comes from***  An insider documents conditions inside his factory and workers’ dorms and a labour activist reacts to what he calls “appalling” conditions at a Top Glove factory in Malaysia. 2:05  Marketplace interviewed 23 current and former migrant workers from across the disposable glove industry in Malaysia who detailed various stories of alleged exploitation: situations of debt bondage, deceptive recruiting practices, passport retention, excessive overtime, abusive workplaces and deplorable living conditions.  Gloves of all types — nitrile, vinyl, latex — are used by health-care workers in many situations,  including swabbing, intubating and examinations. Some health-care professionals can go through several boxes of gloves a week.  ""The only reason I haven't gotten sick, it isn't just luck — it's PPE,"" said  Dr. Nadia Alam, a family doctor and anesthesiologist in Georgetown, Ont. ""It makes me mad that nobody's taking care of \[these workers\].... It's despicable, these kind of practices.""  Dr. Nadia Alam, a physician in Georgetown, Ont., credits PPE with keeping her safe throughout the pandemic. (CBC)  In 2020, Malaysian glove makers produced close to 220 billion gloves, about 70 per cent of the world's supply, according to the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association. Manufacturers rely heavily on migrant workers from countries with few employment opportunities, including Myanmar, Indonesia, Nepal and Bangladesh.  Reports of human rights abuses in the PPE industry aren't isolated to gloves. Gowns were reportedly being made with North Korean forced labour. Masks were being made by ethnic Uyghurs as part of a controversial labour transfer program in China.  ""This is an issue around the world,""  said Hall. ""The whole supply chain of medical products, ventilators, masks, gloves, gowns, it's all coming from an industry with systemic forced labour issues.""",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/qwdbh6/canada_halts_import_of_goods_linked_to_forced/hl2wjlv/

123,13,13,0,1635386740,"**By Liza Lin, Yifan Wang and Jon Emont**  *Oct. 27, 2021 11:22 am ET*  SINGAPORE—Chinese laborer Zhang Qiang set off for Indonesia in March to work for a Chinese steelmaker. Six months later, he was wading through the waters off Malaysia’s shores with four other men, fleeing what he called a scam.  “I felt we were cheated, yet also felt I was helpless,” Mr. Zhang said in an interview from Malaysia, where the men were detained by local authorities.  Mr. Zhang said he was lured to Indonesia by the promise of a better paying job, but his passport was taken once he got off the plane. He and other workers were asked to sign contracts for lower pay and longer durations than they had been promised.  Around 600,000 Chinese migrant workers were employed abroad at the end August, according to official government data, with many of them working for Chinese companies on projects connected to President Xi Jinping’s signature Belt and Road infrastructure-building initiative.  China Labor Watch, a labor rights group based in New York, says experiences like those of Mr. Zhang and his colleagues aren’t uncommon. Based on interviews with around 200 workers in 12 countries and information from a whistleblower in China’s trade ministry who it hasn’t publicly identified, the group estimates that tens of thousands of workers abroad are being paid less than they were promised or exploited in other ways.  China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn’t respond to a request for comment. Beijing has acknowledged the existence of illegal and unlicensed labor dispatch practices over the years. In 2012, the Ministry of Commerce issued a new rule aimed at protecting the rights of overseas workers, and in 2016 asked local authorities to step up enforcement of the rule due to continued violations.  Mr. Zhang, a 31-year-old father of two from China’s central Henan province, was promised the equivalent of about 15,000 yuan ($2,300) a month for a period of six months—an attractive prospect for a man who earned far less welding metal bars at construction sites in China, he said.  He was employed at a work site in the Morowali Industrial Park, a Belt and Road project where Chinese steel giants had invested in large-scale smelting of nickel for use in making stainless steel and electric-vehicle batteries.  Launched in 2013, the trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative aims to tie countries around the world to the Chinese economy through a new network of roads, railways, ports, power plants and factories.  Chinese companies invested at least $12.7 billion into Indonesian steel and nickel projects since 2013, drawn by its large nickel reserves, according to a Wall Street Journal tally of such projects.  The reliance by Chinese companies on labor brought from China instead of local hires has fed resentment in some places. Earlier this year, a large Indonesian labor union criticized the use of unskilled Chinese laborers, saying it cheated local workers out of jobs.Mr. Zhang’s journey began in mid-March, when he saw an advertisement for the Indonesia job in a chat message group for migrant workers. Lured by the promise of a pay bump, he contacted the recruiter who posted the ad and packed a suitcase, reassuring his family that the move would fund a better life, according to his wife, Wang Lan.“When I come back, I’ll buy you a bed,” he told the younger of his two daughters, before boarding a bus in the city of Anyang, in Henan province, to head to the airport, Ms. Wang said.Chinese labor contractors have to obtain a government license before arranging for workers to go overseas.   Commercial and human resources bureaus in the eastern city of Wuxi, where Mr. Zhang’s privately-run contractor Rongcheng Environmental Engineering Co. is based, said no local companies had obtained such a license.Ms. Wang said her husband wasn’t given a contract to sign before leaving and didn’t think to ask the company for proof of a license.   Rongcheng didn’t respond to a request for comment.Arriving in Indonesia, Mr. Zhang and other workers recruited from China were told to put their passports in a box, according to an account posted on WeChat by Mr. Zhang and other workers in early September. They were then transported to a metal smelter site in Morowali operated by Jiangsu Delong Nickel Co. Ltd., a privately-owned Chinese steelmaker whose nickel-production operation in Indonesia was described by Chinese authorities in May 2020 as a “key Belt and Road project.”   Rongcheng Environmental Engineering is a subcontractor for Jiangsu Delong.At Morowali, they were offered construction jobs at a salary of 10,000 yuan a month—instead of the promised 15,000—asked to work longer hours and presented with employment contracts that paid out 1,000 yuan in cash monthly—with the rest of their salary withheld until completion of the project at an unspecified date in the future, according to Ms. Wang.Jiangsu Delong didn’t respond to a request for comment.  Local anger toward Chinese workers means there are few politicians or local organizations in places like Indonesia who are focused on their welfare, which adds to their vulnerability, say labor experts.  China’s pursuit of a zero-Covid-19 strategy has further compounded the problem, according to China Labor Watch’s founder Li Qiang, whose organization has interviewed Chinese workers across Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe since August 2020. Drastic reductions in the number of international flights and stringent entry conditions, including antibody testing and long quarantines, have made it hard for many workers to return home, he said.  Chinese laborers in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Serbia told the Journal that with few new workers coming to replace them, existing workers are prevented or discouraged from returning. Those who want to leave often have to fork over large sums to pay for air tickets and quarantines, which can run between two to four weeks, the laborers said. Workers are generally promised airfare for their travel to and from the countries, but during the pandemic, employers have in many cases withheld the return airfare to get workers to stay longer on the job.  One worker building roads as part of a Belt and Road project in Papua New Guinea, who declined to be named, said about half of the 100 workers on the project are working past the end of their three-year contracts because they are unable to return home.  The price of returning home more than tripled to 65,000 yuan this year after the Chinese government ruled that citizens could only return home on direct flights, he said. With no direct flights from Papua New Guinea, workers needed to fly to Laos and quarantine there first before heading back to China, he said.",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/qhc9v5/chinese_workers_say_they_are_lured_abroad_and/hibvld1/

OK i accept that i should get a doctors note or watever. i paid the fine and wasnt given leniency (except early payment discount). no time for compassion that someone i know is in hospital. FINE i honestly dont hold that against KKM. it was i who did not follow the proper procedure. i accept that.  but what grinds my gears is that i have driven past that same road block maybe 7-8 times and only ONCE was i actually stopped. another time that i was checked was when i had my documentations so they waved me off when i flashed it.   ROAD BLOCKS FOR WHAT? if you say road blocks cause jam. sure thats a given but, WHATS THE FUCKING  POINT OF ROADBLOCKS, if youre just gonna wave 90% of the people off?  ""he looks like hes not going anywhere"", ""oh he looks like hes going interstate""   whats the criteria? why bother having a road block if you dont check EVERYONE.   i strongly support a PROPER lockdown. many people might hate it, i've always supported the idea that we should have done proper lockdowns back last year.  but no. ""small people need to survive"". ""how to eat"". look at where we are now. i told people, our condition is like an athlete with leg injury. the athlete COULD continue training with LOW performance, lower recovery rate AND potential for harming his leg injury even more. OR take an extended but PROPER break allowing him to heal up first.  nope. a huge lot of people are stuck with how do we eat.   similarly schools. some parents say  ""if schools are closed, i cant work coz i need to take care of my kid"". look at what the fuck happened. schools opened, VERY SHORTLY people caught covid  from school clusters. now NOT ONLY do you  have to take care of your kid, your kid is sick. and YOU ARE TOO. so dont need to work either. good fucking job.  i do see the importance of education. i have no confidence that zoom education can work. but if a parent  is working from home or aren't able to work due to everywhere being closed. perhaps an idea, is why not..... TEACH YOUR CHILDREN YOURSELF? i m digressing.  we still live in a time where people do not fear the virus enough. some people say its fake. some people dont believe in vaccines. some people believe their faith will keep them protected.  it REALLY doesnt help that sometimes our LEADERS do not set a good example with photos of them breaking SOP. also, i DONT UNDERSTAND, why is it, that when you need to give a speech, or if you're being recorded, or if you're taking a simple selfie, YOU NEED to take your mask down? is your face so damn fucking important?   so are the influencers on insta/fb/tiktok. sometimes i wonder, are they breaking SOP being so close with other people? sure some of them may have the excuse ""i live with these people"". if thats the case STILL, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE WORD ""INFLUENCER?"" you are influencing people to disregard the SOP. WHO THE FUCK knows who's staying together? monkey see monkey do. in malaysia we have monkeys everywhere.  lets get back to lockdown fatigue, and suicides. people are tired. the people ""like me"" who follow  the SOP. play it safe etc. we're fucking tired. when people are tired, they tend to let their guard down. when we make ourselves vulnerable, our chances of getting it is higher. but at this point many of us are starting to no longer care. fuckit. kena, kenalah. nasib mah.  then theres the issue of VAXXHOLES. a lot of people are getting vaccinated. i am quite happy to hear that. BUT, some people are getting vaccinated SO THEY CAN GO OUT.   selfish fucks.   there are people who cannot vaccinate or have a risk that make them unable to vaccinate. these people are vulnerable. i dislike those who actively refuse vaccination but i would still sympathize. sometimes a child is born into a family of antivaxxers. are you telling me that you wouldnt mind spreading covid onto these people? really. wheres the sympathy? be a better person!  there are a lot of talks on allowing people to get a ""travel passport"". where having single/double vaccination allows you to go out/dine in etc. let me just bring you back to what i mentioned earlier. implementation and enforcement is SHIT. roadblocks are poorly implemented. what makes you certain that this travel passport can work?  the ""easiest"" solution is everyone is forced to show their vax status using mysejahtera. i admit this is the ONLY reasonable way to implement it. but it must come with REQUIRING people to show their IC/passport. i have witnessed a delivery company get blocked from entering a premise as one of their workers ""didnt bring phone"". they came back later and were allowed entry as the ""phone"" they brought has double vaccines and is in good status.  i strongly believe that people will not be diligent to check and ensure the phone/mysejahtera matches the person ID. checking the mysejahtera is already a hassle in itself.  i m digressing again.  the virus. is like a stupid chain mail. send this to 10 friends or bad luck falls onto you. some people check their mail late. forwards this to their friends. and their friends keep reforwarding it back to themselves over and over again.  a vicious cycle of infection because not everyone is taking it seriously enough.  i m fucking sick and tired of this shit.",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/oxyxid/why_is_malaysia_covid_cases_keep_rising/h7rapo9/

136,26,26,0,1626102301,"Thanks for your honest response. I hope the discussion can continue without personal attacks.  I'd like to dig a bit deeper to better understand where you are coming from, as I too have encountered a few anti-vax and vaccine hesitant individual.  From what I gather, it's not that you do not take the pandemic seriously, but that you do not trust the authority mandating the vaccine. Is this only at the local scale (incompetent govt), or is it in line with more of the global mistrust (globalist central control agenda)? If not can you help articulate your point of view? I can understand if the mistrust is local, and if the virus is only affecting the region. But seeing that the pandemic is global, and we can see the daily news  countries that have started to open up due to more vaccination, what else would it take to convince you to register? Also do you see any other way free people could tackle the issue of global pandemic without global coordination and support?     Secondly, do you work or have close friends who work with people in the medical field? Do you accept their concern that the longer the virus exists and is allowed to spread, the higher the chance for it to evolve into something more deadly? What are your thoughts on vaccination for people who work at the hospitals where they are exposed to infected people far more than the normal person?     There are many reasons for one to be anti-vax/vaccine hesitant, so is good to be able to have civilized discussion about it. From my own encounter, the most anti-vax person I have personally talked to at length, has a general mistrust of authority both locally and globally. She also came from a religious background that saw current events as fulfilling some biblical prophecy. At one point she also brought up parallels with the 'mark of the beast' to the vaccine, and vaccine passports being a way for the globalist to control human kind. It took a bit of convincing to show that we have always needed some sort of vaccine passport to travel to high risk area. It's just that this is a global pandemic the type we only see once a century, and everywhere is high risk, before the conversation could be brought back closer to reality. It took a few months of discussion before she decided to change her view on the vaccine.  Another vaccine hesitant encounter is not my own but that of a family member who had a friend who also adopted the wait and see approach. She did not register even when her age group has already long been called for appointment. I could not get any further details behind her hesitancy, other than she wanted to ""wait and see"". Unfortunately she contracted Covid in May, admitted to ICU, put on oxygen and had organ failure after 2 months. She passed away recently without her family by her side.  I'm not sharing this to scare you into registering, or forcing my P.O.V on you. Just to share my stories of people I have encountered (not on internet). If other people can share their experience with people they know ( in real life), or their own reasons for choosing not to vaccinate, please share.

It was posted at September 2019 and the video is talking about ""rehersal of containing a pandemic"" and coincidentally we have the pandemic.

I meant during MCO i do witness a lot of people not follow the SOP and do whatever they want, ie group activities w/o mask. Take Taiwan as a case study, they did impose a self lockdown prior goverment imposing it. Regarding to my thought on those doctor who exposed themselves with the patients, i do believe that they have the knowledge how to prevent themselves and they know better than most us what do to prevent from getting it.

It wont be surprise that you did open some of my mind in the discusssion. I myself is not a religious person , and yes i do heard the ""mark of beast"" theory and ""insert the chips into our body"". Dont be surprised that i do heard about 5g is related to covid-19 haha. I strongly oppose a vaccine passport and it is taking away our human rights. I do believe that we can win over this pandemic with the history of(Plague disease, Spanish Flu,although it is not a global scale).      I do heard of alot of funny theories on anti vacc as well haha. What i am trying to express is i do not want to blindly follow the crowd for the vaccine. I do not take vaccine due to peer pressure and i think for myself why should/shouldnt i take the vaccine. Do let me know if you have any question.     The following discussion is out of topic discussion. From your discussion , i can know that you are a kind and open minded person.

If you're in uni, many private unis have voluntary student exchange programs where you could do a maximum of two semesters abroad while still paying local tuition fees. It's still going on if you can find a placement during COVID, but it'll pick up again after all this. If you're not in school, just backpack and do unofficial jobs for some months and see if you find a reason to stay out there. Luckily, Malaysia has a very high passport power index.  I started traveling alone at eighteen and fell in love with Thailand and West/Central Europe because they are both very liberal places. Even their hardliners aren't as bad as the hardliners here. Malays look so silly when you come back. They freak out at pork and alcohol and not praying and LGBT people. Literal cave people from Plato's allegory.

Its been only about 18 months (21 if you count the 3 months China did an information blackout to hide the pandemic in its early stages in Wuhan) since the virus made its debut on this planet.  &amp;#x200B;  Second being that when herd immunity is achieved worldwide, most nations probably wont give a hoot about these passports because their own citizens are already vaccinated.

192,82,31,0,1630462351,"&gt;My sentiment comes from the fact that someone I know who has underlying medical conditions and is at risk with vaccinations, will be excommunicated from society, even as her doctor advised her not to get vaccinated yet, so why would the government go against the mind of a qualified doctor on health issues? Is it me or does this simply not make sense?  If you have a medical dispensation against getting vaccinated, then that's fine.  Right now everything is a WIP. Our NSC is not a very agile body and you can see policies and guidelines being issued are slow or at times contradictory.  Yes, it sucks if you're strongly discouraged from being vaccinated and not being able to do certain things that those who have are - i.e. dining in, visiting certain locations et al.  But this is government. Government is not nippy and swift. In time I'm sure the guidelines will be issued for those who have not been vaccinated on medical advice.  On the other hand we have the other side. Takut, I heard my neighbour's second cousin's best friend's acquaintance died after being vaccinated, it's my body and my right to decide what goes into it! So many reasons. Sure.  But guess what, you don't live in a bubble. If you decline to be vaccinated for reasons such as those directly stated in the above paragraph, you're being selfish. Yeah, I'm sure I'll get brickbats for this comment but let's face it. We are in a D I S A S T E R situation. There is no reset button. There is no load save game button.  If you don't want to tango, then don't expect others to switch from the tango to the cha-cha because that's what you want to dance. (everyone else is tango-ing)  Eventually you're going to get to a situation where establishments have a choice and not merely following government guidelines. I work in a restaurant. The restaurant has a right to refuse service to you.  Even if the government says ""Okay! Everyone can dine in!"" and the restaurant CHOOSES to say, ""Sorry. Only those fully vaccinated can come in, please show your MySejahtera vaccine certificate as proof."" there is nothing you can say to overrule that. Sure you could take me to court if you like, but that again is your prerogative. Who knows, you might win after all, but then again, you might lose.  Likewise, shopping malls can say, ""Vaccinated only!"" and why is this? Because it's not a public space is it? It's a private establishment.  The only locations you can probably visit assuming restrictions are lifted are government establishments. Want to go makan, watch a movie, enjoy a theme park? If they say vaccinated only, again that's THEIR RIGHT to do so.  When it comes to employment that becomes a whole different ballgame altogether. Can employers terminate employees who decline to be vaccinated (without medical cause)? That is a can of worms that would be too long for my already lengthy comment.",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/pfjvol/opinions_on_vaccine_authoritarianism/hb4ym9o/

The death rate of SARS CoV-2 is &lt;0.0115% in children below 12 (per KKM data). This is THE SAME as the death rate of the common cold in children below 12 (per CDC data). So why vaccinate kids?  Because the science behind COVID is not fully understood, and that kids' immune system is still developing.  &gt; Goalposts keep changing. They took your fundamental human right freedoms under the guise of keeping you safe. Then they said you'll get your freedoms back when you get vaccinated. Then they said not good enough, get boosted. No one knows how the goalpost will change next.  Refer to the above counterpoints. The goalpost will always be subject to change. That's not necessarily a bad thing.  As for the remarks on how other countries are handling COVID, do note that their strategies and countermeasures have yet to yield results. For example, Japanese government's natural immunity plan is heavily criticised by their own citizens, especially during the Olympics last year. US, being a beacon of personal sovereignty, most definitely has shown great and tremendous success in combating COVID, right?",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/sd1kd9/malaysian_antivax_group_branching_out_thoughts/huegbur/
230,120,1,0,1643204879,"I don't have much to add on MFM apart from the fact their logo seems to have been made on powerpoint. I would however like to share some thoughts I have:-  \- Vaccinated, Pfizer 2 doses. Not taken a booster and don't plan to for now. Never caught Covid, this despite multiple times being in contact with persons who have tested positive within a few days of contact.   \- Informed consent. I believe the job of the government is to present its citizens with as much facts as it can and yet leave consent to the individual. I am of the opinion that vaccine mandates are fundamentally wrong. If you don't have sovereignty over your own body, then what do you have left? You might as well not live.  \- If someone decides they are not ready to take any vaccine for any reason. That should be their sovereign right. If you are happy to take a vaccine, again, that is your personal right. No one should force anyone else to do anything.  \- Mask mandate &amp; vaccine passport. I don't really know how I feel about this. On one hand I do see the appeal of the wider benefit of keeping the community safe, on the other hand I do not agree that the government should have the right of telling you where you can and cannot go based on whether you have taken a jab. Perhaps leave this to the decision of the individual business owners / shop themselves?  \- No difference in 'user experience' of vaccinated vs unvaccinated. Vaccinated: Can catch covid, can spread covid, can be hospitalised, can die. Unvaccinated: Can catch covid, can spread covid, can be hospitalised, can die.  \- Never have I ever seen a movement on this scale to coerce people into taking a vaccine, and to dehumanise those who don't comply.   \- Do not vaccinate the children. I am happy KKM's stance is that vaccination of kids is optional. The death rate of SARS CoV-2 is &lt;0.0115% in children below 12 (per KKM data). This is THE SAME as the death rate of the common cold in children below 12 (per CDC data). So why vaccinate kids?  \- Why is the dominant strategy vaccines and not natural immunity? \[Japan recognises natural immunity on par with vaccines\]. The average person who has died from Covid already has 4 comorbidities (CDC data). UK estimates people who ACTUALLY died only from Covid to be about 50,000. Covid is a disease of the aged &amp;  immunocompromised. When was the last time KKM told you to eat well, get enough sunlight, exercise and boost your natural immune system?   \- The virus is real but the response of governments all over the world from the start of the pandemic has been unprecedented and a vast overreach of powers. It is clear, even as recent as today from Denmark, that lockdowns kill economies more effectively than it prevents Covid spread. If lockdowns worked, then everyone in the UAE (which has not had a lockdown since June 2020) should have caught Covid and died by now.  \- Goalposts keep changing. They took your fundamental human right freedoms under the guise of keeping you safe. Then they said you'll get your freedoms back when you get vaccinated. Then they said not good enough, get boosted. No one knows how the goalpost will change next.  That is all.

Source: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=374045344080951&amp;id=100044264657476&amp;sfnsn=mo  For example, if you are unvaccinated by the time the health pass system is in place, you are not allowed to leave your home at all unless you pay for two swab tests(whether positive or negative) each week. You are also forbidden to dine in, gyms and not allowed to attend large events such as concerts, parades.

254,144,25,0,1627399001,"Super long post incoming.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;instead of my friends who criticize me for leaving my job at this crucial pandemic time.  Always remember this one thing, your boss and your colleagues are just your boss and your colleagues. Believe me the company would leave you in their crucial period, even if you were loyal for years. A great boss is rare in Malaysia. At the end of the day, when you grow old one day you will probably look back and you won't even remember most of what you were doing in your 20s career-wise. But you will remember that mum and dad has always been there for you, no matter what. Trust me, all these corporate loyalty especially in Malaysia is just ridiculous considering the Malaysian median salary isn't even good enough to convince anyone that the company gives a shit about any single employee.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Just curious, how are you right now with handling your dad passing?  My dad passed at 59, my dad was a very flawed man. Had affairs, didn't spend as much time with the family as he should have. But he provided a comfortable life for us and gave us anything we wanted. I don't have a super close relationship with my dad like most modern families but his passing still had a huge impact on me. He was always very focused on work and career and I guess in a way I wasn't able to be his ideal son when he was alive, I had just graduated university and for normal parents this should have been enough. But my dad was working with limited time, he always wanted me to show him he could trust me to have a proper career and be independent.   Only when we lose someone, we think about the lost opportunities. He was just a few months short from watching my graduation ceremony, just 2 years short from watching me close my biggest contract in business. I always come back to the question, is he watching me? If he's around just a little longer how joyful he would be .  I wasn't able to see him beam with pride much when he was around, I wasn't given the opportunity to do that. When he passed I was only 22. I guess I personally do not care about showing off any achievements to him, I just wanted to see him very proud just for his last chapter of his life.   I lived with what-ifs for so many years and a part of me still do, but eventually we do move on. Life has to go on, and eventually we will close the book on the previous chapter knowingly or otherwise.  In a way, I accepted his flaws when he was alive and I wish I had done more for him and with him but eventually we all have to move on and life always finds a way to help us move on. I still think about him always, you will never forget your parents but it will be okay.   I really hope this pandemic goes away quickly and you and your mum are able to get that vaccine passport to go to Japan. The situation you have right now is the situation you have right now, at the very least we shouldn't give up hope for something just because it gets scary to hold on to that hope.

263,153,34,0,1626102301,"Thanks for your honest response. I hope the discussion can continue without personal attacks.  I'd like to dig a bit deeper to better understand where you are coming from, as I too have encountered a few anti-vax and vaccine hesitant individual.  From what I gather, it's not that you do not take the pandemic seriously, but that you do not trust the authority mandating the vaccine. Is this only at the local scale (incompetent govt), or is it in line with more of the global mistrust (globalist central control agenda)? If not can you help articulate your point of view? I can understand if the mistrust is local, and if the virus is only affecting the region. But seeing that the pandemic is global, and we can see the daily news  countries that have started to open up due to more vaccination, what else would it take to convince you to register? Also do you see any other way free people could tackle the issue of global pandemic without global coordination and support?     Secondly, do you work or have close friends who work with people in the medical field? Do you accept their concern that the longer the virus exists and is allowed to spread, the higher the chance for it to evolve into something more deadly? What are your thoughts on vaccination for people who work at the hospitals where they are exposed to infected people far more than the normal person?     There are many reasons for one to be anti-vax/vaccine hesitant, so is good to be able to have civilized discussion about it. From my own encounter, the most anti-vax person I have personally talked to at length, has a general mistrust of authority both locally and globally. She also came from a religious background that saw current events as fulfilling some biblical prophecy. At one point she also brought up parallels with the 'mark of the beast' to the vaccine, and vaccine passports being a way for the globalist to control human kind. It took a bit of convincing to show that we have always needed some sort of vaccine passport to travel to high risk area. It's just that this is a global pandemic the type we only see once a century, and everywhere is high risk, before the conversation could be brought back closer to reality. It took a few months of discussion before she decided to change her view on the vaccine.  Another vaccine hesitant encounter is not my own but that of a family member who had a friend who also adopted the wait and see approach. She did not register even when her age group has already long been called for appointment. I could not get any further details behind her hesitancy, other than she wanted to ""wait and see"". Unfortunately she contracted Covid in May, admitted to ICU, put on oxygen and had organ failure after 2 months. She passed away recently without her family by her side.  I'm not sharing this to scare you into registering, or forcing my P.O.V on you. Just to share my stories of people I have encountered (not on internet). If other people can share their experience with people they know ( in real life), or their own reasons for choosing not to vaccinate, please share. Thanks.",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/oil7jw/should_antivaccine_disseminators_be_punished_govt/h4xdvpj/
264,154,35,1,1626106386,"Thank you for your kind response and a civilised discussion. I will discuss with you part by part.    I am from Penang. I am prone to be lone ranger due to my believe. Thats why i am very appreciate that we can discuss this topic peacefully. All my peers are FOMO(Fear of Missing Out) to get the vaccine and I am the only one who do not care about it and i carry on my life as usual. I dont spend much time on this covid issue and i would spend more time on earning money.      Basically, I do not trust the Globalist and the Phamarceutical Corporation. From the beginning of the first day , i felt like its more a Plan-demic than a pandemic. Its like everything is being planned from the first day. I remember i saw one video(i have forgotten what is the name of the video at youtube, i will send you when i recalled). It was posted at September 2019 and the video is talking about ""rehersal of containing a pandemic"" and coincidentally we have the pandemic. From my POV, it is like the Globalist is treating us like a clown. They want a group of mindless people who is obedient and easy to control.

Haha, in other way, i am giving my spots to people who want to take the shots.  I do not have friend who is working in the medical line but i do know they are exhausted from the pandemic. Let's just touch a surface discussion on our daily. People have been blaming the local authority for the incompetency of controlling the pandemic. IMO, its all down to rakyat self discipline. I meant during MCO i do witness a lot of people not follow the SOP and do whatever they want, ie group activities w/o mask. Take Taiwan as a case study, they did impose a self lockdown prior goverment imposing it. Regarding to my thought on those doctor who exposed themselves with the patients, i do believe that they have the knowledge how to prevent themselves and they know better than most us what do to prevent from getting it. Props to the frontliners for taking care of this country during this pandemic     Yes, I do really appreciate a civilised discussion on this topic and you are one of the most polite person that i have ever talk with. It wont be surprise that you did open some of my mind in the discusssion. I myself is not a religious person , and yes i do heard the ""mark of beast"" theory and ""insert the chips into our body"". Dont be surprised that i do heard about 5g is related to covid-19 haha. I strongly oppose a vaccine passport and it is taking away our human rights. I do believe that we can win over this pandemic with the history of(Plague disease, Spanish Flu,although it is not a global scale).      I do heard of alot of funny theories on anti vacc as well haha. What i am trying to express is i do not want to blindly follow the crowd for the vaccine. I do not take vaccine due to peer pressure and i think for myself why should/shouldnt i take the vaccine. Do let me know if you have any question.     The following discussion is out of topic discussion. From your discussion , i can know that you are a kind and open minded person. Let's us not forget our peers who need mentally support during this lockdown and do provide assistance to them. I do have friends that is staying outstation alone and the lockdown has constraint them mentally and financially.",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/oil7jw/should_antivaccine_disseminators_be_punished_govt/h4xm9s1/
265,155,36,2,1626109868,"&gt; I mean, isn't the standard meaning of Islamaphobia ""an irrational fear of Islam and Muslims""? What other meaning could there be?  You'd think that, but this word has been used and abused in all manner of methods. Same way how sexism and racism has as well. In the game of identity politics, you simply check to see what boxes the victim checks, then accuse the ""oppressor"" of whatever those boxes are linked to. Suppose someone gets fired from a company. Based on their gender, race, age and even religion, they could now level a ton of different accusations towards their company, and even if the company is innocent in all these things, the PR hit would be massive.   Once again, identity politics is commonly abused as both a reactive and proactive method to wrangle a favorable reaction. Which is why I want you to specify what you mean by islamaphobia and not assume I already know.   &gt; Yes but this wouldn't be an irrational fear against Islam and those who follow it but an irrational fear of a certain sect of Islam, which is different.  Potato potatoe. The shia muslims would just argue its shia islamophobia.  Semantics is all it is.   &gt; I doubt this is about islam, it's moreso the implementations of their archaic actions, which they claim to be ""Islam"".  PAS could claim islamaphobia since these actions have never been fully implemented, hence these fears are irrational. I've been dealing with identity politics for more than a decade, and trust me, at the end of the day its not the rational reasoning that wins out, but rather the loudest and most SOB voice.   &gt; Disagreement or misunderstanding of following certain rules/laws of Islam is not Islamaphobia, it's just a set of preferences.   No its not. In Malaysia (Islam) as a general rule, conversion is usually irreversible. Not to mention your children are born into the religion, and will have a hard time converting out if they try. In some of the more primitive nations, attempts to convert will result in murder and honor killing.   &gt; (IMO Anyone being introduced into a damn religion would be quite shooketh, especially if it's an abrahamic religion).  None of the other abrahamic religions are this effed up about conversion and apostacy. Also, neither Judaism nor Christianity demand people convert to their religion before marrying one of their own. In other words, this is an irrelevant argument.  &gt; But it could be, and atleast in the states, it is. People are denied rights that others can enjoy because they are Muslim (like being denied jobs, housing,protection, etc).  Earlier you mentioned ""preference"". So let me ask you this. How do you separate preferences and oppression? What if society as a whole reject gay relationships? Its a preference for gay people to choose their partners, so if a huge majority of people in society prefer straight partners, would you consider it an oppression of gay people?   My take on the whole ""oppression"" idea is that its oppression if its done in the context where fairness must be upheld with the intent to cause harm. Note the extremely specificness of it. There must be intent to cause harm, and it is done in the context where the withheld service/products/treatment is offered to everyone else.   &gt; While I agree that many people use these words baselessly, they are actual things that plague society and should be discussed. Letting people get away with using these words baselessly actually worsens the problem. For example, if you call everyone racist, it would diminish the meaning of that word over time, making instances of actual racism harder to point out and solve. That's the whole point of me starting this discussion: to make people realise that they are not oppressed because they are Muslim in Malaysia, and to stop using the word baselessly because it's disrespectful towards those who actually go through it. Obv one reddit post isn't going to enlighten everyine over night, I still did it anyway coz I like discussing these things.  I think this is the part where we both shake hands because we both agree on the definition and potential solution of the problem, but disagree on where the slider bars land and specifics. Again my whole argument can be encapsulated with the following:  &gt;  Letting people get away with using these words baselessly actually worsens the problem.  Which again, is why I want people to specify and define their accusations before even giving them the time of day. Its pretty much built into the way I behave, which is why I respond the way I did. Its done in a way where people cannot accuse me of being unsympathetic, but at the same time its done in a way to out a liar if they are one.   Ultimately I think its best if people dont mix the concept of oppression with the concept of islamaphobia as it blurs the lines and just makes it even harder to define and discuss each topic. Oppression simply defines as the exercise of authority or power in a cruel and harmful fashion. Again, keywords being authority and power. A baker refusing to sell you a cake is not being oppressive. A group of bakers refusing to sell you a cake is not being oppressive. A group of bakers colluding to refuse to sell you a cake on the other hand, can be said to be oppressive, since by colluding againts you, they establish an authority or power that you dont have.   On the other hand, government servants engaging in these on the personal level can be defined as engaging in oppression, since they're obliged to carry out their duties fairly, and being a government servant provides them access to a variety of authoritarian powers to coerce you into complying. Case in point, if you tried to apply for a vaccine passport and the government employee demands a 1000% fee, you cannot refuse, because if you do, that government employee can file a police report againts you for running around without a vaccine passport. A private agency cannot do this, even if its within a corporation since there are and always will be methods to deal with this, including quitting, complaints made to the appropriate government body, and so on. Oppression can occur from a variety of things, and it often isnt done as a result of irrational fears. More often than not its as simple as a power trip, laziness, sadism or greed. People in power in general do not engage in petty oppression if they have an irrational fear of something; they take any and all actions to crush it as well as warn off future acts. This is why police in Malaysia take such harsh actions on people engaging in sedition, as opposed to... extorting people for money if they catch them with a packet of cocaine.",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/oiimbh/are_malaysian_muslims_entitled_to_say_i/h4xvn9h/

LRT is super empty, to a point you can lie down on the seat or the floor. Granted this was around 2pm, but it kinda bizarre experience. 2. PWTC routing / queue changed abit, usually I come from behind entrance near Putra Mall and Hotel... Pacific? after going down from elevated walkaway from LRT. Now it is forced to go around from the main entrance 3. There is 2 entrance for vaccination, 1 for 1st timer and mine is 2nd dose. Oh gosh, I reached there around 3pm and feel like Im elderly group that go straight to registration, vaccination &amp; observation area in just 10 minutes! 4. Some miscommunication made us wait about 25 minutes before let go. Basically some announcement on how vaccination passport work. 5. The ""I have vaccinated"" photobooth now is near the back entrance, but when I went there there is no staff to help so i didnt take any picture. 6. Afterward I just went to Putra Mall to go for some grocery shopping (I havent go out of house for 8 weeks afterall). They quite strict (must not have ""high risk"" in mysejahtera).  Take note entrance near LRT is closed  7. The mall looking like super sad. All shops are closed, most of that still open are food with some foodpanda / rider walking around. Lots of people were in Cold Storage, but I just go quickly and went back home. 8. At the moment, after I took panadol every 6 hours, I still have slightly ... ""feel like fever"" and nothing else. I was abit concerned because I was gaming till morning (day before vaccine) and had only sleep like 2 hours. Nothing bad so far.   Thats all folks. Thanks for reading.

276,166,47,2,1624260912,"I'm still not sold on this whole vaccination passport idea. Two core reasons, first being that the current vaccination program at any time risks being rendered obsolete when the virus mutates into a form that is completely immune to all existing vaccines. We're already seeing reports that say that Pfizer is less effective (AZ even more so) againts the India variant. Its been only about 18 months (21 if you count the 3 months China did an information blackout to hide the pandemic in its early stages in Wuhan) since the virus made its debut on this planet.  &amp;#x200B;  Second being that when herd immunity is achieved worldwide, most nations probably wont give a hoot about these passports because their own citizens are already vaccinated. This idea applies for most vaccinable diseases, where we dont have any sort of vaccine passports for them, despite some of them posing a much higher threat than Covid for a nation's population.  &amp;#x200B;  Honestly tho, I hope that Malaysia continues to accelerate towards herd immunity, and in the future make the vaccines widely available to the public via private practices. Once this is achieved, the need for ""vaccine passports"" will be drastically reduced, and by then we'd be able to dismiss the need for it.

That's when I knew that they got word that it was going to be extended.  People with visas expiring in January were told to ""come back tomorrow"".  Mine expired in Feb but I'd booked online which saved me from being kicked out.

You should be able to bypass the queue of people, go directly to the desk, and show them the e-mail that you get after you make a booking. That'll save you a lot of time.  I've been here for 23 months extending every time and I used to write ""flights cancelled due to covid"" in my form. I was questioned on 4 occasions. One lady accused me of working here. The same one also questioned my ability to return home another time. Another (the angry one) questioned how I support myself and another time accused me of providing a false address. Asides from causing issues over nothing and being angry power trippers in general, that's about as serious as it ever got with the immigration ladies at MTT.  Here's how it all went down originally. I arrived at the start of March 2020. Before it was time to go, I went to MTT to get my extension. It was chaos, highly confusing, and it took forever. They had it in the big multi-storey car park next to the skyscraper, not in that little office building that hosts them now. The process took all day. You could get there, be sent to the 5th floor, and then they'd send row by row lower as people got processed. Eventually as the tourist numbers died down, they stopped hosting it there and moved it to the little building.   Initially it was a monthly stamp thing, then they changed it to 2 months, but they'd only give you a 2-week stamp after you'd paid and had your paperwork processed. After the 2 weeks you'd go back with just your passport and they'd stamp another 6 weeks onto it. This eventually changed to giving you the full 2 months on the first visit.  For some months, depending on the time you went, you could walk into the building and you'd be the only person there, or there'd be a few other people max. I think the fastest I've been in and out is about 10 minutes. It helped that I had a stamp that wasn't on the 1st of the month as that's when it was busiest. You may be able to push your stamp out by overstaying a day but I'm not sure any more.  It's been a wild ride of worrying that I'll be rejected of the scheme won't be renewed. I'm going to be changing to a marriage visa this time round to avoid any possible issues as it sounds like they're getting serious about it all. Strange that they want tourism to return, but don't want tourists staying in the country spending money.

339,2,2,0,1643203714,"So much wrong and idiotic in your sour grapes response, but I think it will be educational to others if I respond point by point. I must say that I don't think I have ever seen a post in which every enumerated point was flatly wrong.  First off, I am not trading anything. I don't have to give up my US citizenship. Look up dual citizenship. India doesn't allow it, but they do allow citizens who obtain foreign citizenship to obtain a status that is pretty much the same. About the only important thing they cannot do is own agricultural land. I know, because I just spoke to an Indian who obtained Thai citizenship and he went through that process. You might want to check that out so you are more informed in the future.   a. PR is expensive, time consuming, and takes years. In any case, not necessary if you are married. Process averages 3-4 years start to finish.  b. It is not always easy to start a company under the US treaty, and many things are still prohibited. And it costs money and time. And reams of documentation.  c. Sure you have the right to stay under an O visa, which you need to apply for each year, and report every 90 days, etc. No more need for me to do that. At all. BTW, I can now enter Burma, Cambodia, Laos and some other countries visa free, which I could not do before. I can still use my US passport when overseas as that is perfectly legal and acceptable. Enter and leave Thailand with your Thai passport, and you can use whichever one you want overseas.   d. No need for me to negotiate for a higher pay package as I am mostly self employed. My part time Thai employer could care less. They pay me for the skill they need, not because I am a foreigner or Thai.  e. There is no requirement to renounce my US citizenship. The US government isn't accepting that anyway for the last several years, ostensibly because of COVID.  f. My kids are US citizens. My citizenship status doesn't affect their ability to immigrate to the US in any way whatsoever.   **Reread this until you understand this:**  Why would Thais see me as anything other than a farang? Citizenship doesn't change your ethnicity. I am a Thai citizen, with all the rights and responsibilities that entails. I am not ethnically Thai. What a nonsensical argument. I am sorry your experience here has evidently not been as pleasant a one as mine. You seem bitter than you are ethnically Indian. Why is that I wonder?  Throughout my time here, and throughout this process, I have never met a single Thai who had an issue with my living here or becoming a Thai citizenship. Not one. Every, and I mean EVERY, Thai official I dealt with during this process were extremely encouraging.

If you have to prove your income, you will need to have the status of a regular employee living abroad for the company in your home country.  For me, a digital nomad is a person who has broken all the official connections with his home country and needs nothing back. They pay no taxes and don't demand support from the home country in social security.  They work for companies organizations, but there is no official contract.   Most of the (European/Belgian/Netherlands digital nomads I know:  - the ask for a new international passport  - inform their home country that they leave  - and stay under the radar for 6 1/2 years.

After 6 1/2 years, they inform the local embassy that they are in their jurisdiction, and if needed, register at the embassy and ask for a new passport. Or they go, for a short time, back to their home country for a new passport.  They work but are paid in Bitcoin or Monero. There is no official registration of their income.

For me, this is entirely different than a person who works officially for a (European) company and has his salary on a European bank account.  Most people who use a European bank have to inform the bank of their official address outside Europe. (And several banks in the Netherlands and Belgium start to close the accounts if you live outside the European Monetary Union)  Or they have to inform their government where they live because they have to pay taxes on their income.  For them, it will be easy to prove the Thai government their official income, but are you still a digital nomad?

My situation:   I am South African and we only have around 200 covid cases a day atm but still we are considered a medium risk zone even though some European countries are at 25 000+ a day and low risk... don't understand that logic. Anyway so we needed to apply for the sandbox setup.  You can imagine how stressed we were about our vaccine certificate QR code not being recognised because South Africa is usually behind on everything or not even thought about before the richer countries so there was very little faith it would go through smoothly.  We uploaded through: - Gmail,  - Used ordinary passport - South African vaccine certificate + separate pic of vaccine QR code. Our vaccine certificate showed our ID numbers but not passport numbers (so I wouldn't worry about editing that in like some people have)  - For accomadation we just used our SHABA certificate which we requested from sha+ hotel and entered the SHABA number provided  into the booking ID part. - AXA insurance certificate showed specifically that covid is covered.   I was honestly the most stressed and strung out I have ever been, I registered a few times on different emails, because I was so scared I had done something wrong. I called my countries Thai embassy who could not help, I tried calling that helpline they provided but noone answered, couldnt sleep or eat..

I have not seen many cases of anyone being out right denied yet, we are all rightfully stressing because we are in the first few weeks of the system operating and are essentially guinea pigs!

383,46,46,1,1635698575,"First, when you go to immigration, be sure you understand that what you likely have is a visa exempt entry, not a visa on arrival. Visa Exempt is when they just stamp your passport for 30 days when you arrive. Visa on Arrival is a separate scheme that is required for passport-holders from about 20 countries that don't qualify for Visa Exempt, like India and China, and requires that you apply and pay for a visa at the special kiosk at the airport when you land.   Second, as others have pointed out, visa exempt, tourist visas, and visa on arrival can only be extended one time for 30 days. The covid extension is a special program that is set to expire on 26 November currently unless they extend it further. It grants 60 days and is renewable repeatedly as long as the covid extension program continues. However, immigration only grants the 60 day covid extension after you get your normal 30 day extension. So, given that you haven't gotten the 30 day extension yet, the covid extension program is currently set to expire before your 30 day extension would end, so you likely won't be able to get that extension.

Basically I just went on the website and got the info and sent my Passport up to Ottawa by mail from Nova Scotia. Now I realize things are different with Insurance COE documents, Hotel booking etc.  I would advise you to come into Phuket via the Sandbox program. You don’t have to do quarantine, just check into one of the approved Hotels . They will do a Covid Check and then you are free to explore the island. After 2 weeks you can go to other parts of the Country. As a Canadian you don’t have to bring money over. Immigration will accept letter from the Canadian Embassy. Your best bet is to go to the CRA website log into your account and print off a Proof of Income letter.  That’s one reason I like Chiang Mai because of the Canadian Consulate. They are super helpful there.  Assist Thai Visa is the Agent I use in Chiang Mai . They are very professional and have close Thais with the Expat Club .

The idea is simple and a vaccine passport aims to give travelers a physical or digital record to verify that a citizen has been fully vaccinated and authorized for entry.A vaccine passport will most likely be part of the mandatory travel documents people need to present to travel in the near future and according to a recent article published by local media The Thaiger, Thailand has introduced their version of an international vaccine passport certifying Covid-19 immunization.

Astra Zeneca shots made in Europe, India and South Korea are also accepted, **but not those made in Thailand by Siam Bioscience, as it has not yet been approved by either WHO or EMA**.• The vaccination certificate is accepted in Spanish, English, French or German.• The vaccination certificate must include the name and surname of the applicant, date of vaccination and doses, type of vaccine and number of doses administered, issuing country and identification of the issuing body of the vaccination certificate.

My situation:   I am South African and we only have around 200 covid cases a day atm but still we are considered a medium risk zone even though some European countries are at 25 000+ a day and low risk... don't understand that logic. Anyway so we needed to apply for the sandbox setup.  You can imagine how stressed we were about our vaccine certificate QR code not being recognised because South Africa is usually behind on everything or not even thought about before the richer countries so there was very little faith it would go through smoothly.  We uploaded through: - Gmail,  - Used ordinary passport - South African vaccine certificate + separate pic of vaccine QR code. Our vaccine certificate showed our ID numbers but not passport numbers (so I wouldn't worry about editing that in like some people have)  - For accomadation we just used our SHABA certificate which we requested from sha+ hotel and entered the SHABA number provided  into the booking ID part. - AXA insurance certificate showed specifically that covid is covered.   I was honestly the most stressed and strung out I have ever been, I registered a few times on different emails, because I was so scared I had done something wrong. I called my countries Thai embassy who could not help, I tried calling that helpline they provided but noone answered, couldnt sleep or eat.. But my girlfriend remained calm and only made one application without reapplying 50 times like me and at the end of the day we both got the approvals and she got hers 1 hour before me!!  That being said, the best advice I can offer is; STAY CALM. I have not seen many cases of anyone being out right denied yet, we are all rightfully stressing because we are in the first few weeks of the system operating and are essentially guinea pigs!

The 30 mns waiting time should have been cut out for safety concerns. If someone feels unwell, they can return.  People should have been let go and allowed to remain in the area or not far away.  I've never had more than a cup of orange juice and sent away when vaccinated in the past.   Then i get handed a pathetic little piece if paper that says ""Thailand certificate "" for covid vaccine.  It's useless.  Then i was told I had to go to one of only three places to get a vaccine ""passport"". So i had to travel to nonthaburi arrived at 6AM and spent another 3 hours indoors with more people not really respecting social distancing.  One lady checks the papers, then you hand them to a lady at a window at 6.30. At 8 am she calls your name and hands them back to you, telling you to go upstairs where you start again.    So total I spent 5 hours indoors, not including two round trips traveling, in two days.  Probably there will be many posts following telling me I'm a shit head, been it's caused great anxiety.  I stayed in or traveled thru more than a dozen countries on 4 continent's since end of 2019, I've been safe so far, but so totally vulnerable the past two days.

513,176,87,0,1615797001,"I keep seeing comments like yours in r/worldnews, but vaccination certificates/""passports"" already exist. They're little yellow booklets, (originally) issued by the WHO. To enter certain countries, certain vaccinations (like ones against yellow fever) may be required, and that's how these booklets came about. They're actually quite convenient to carry around when travelling. If you injure yourself or get bitten by a stray dog, you'll know whether or not you'll need to get a booster jab.   The first page is for compulsory vaccinations (yellow fever), and there's a couple more pages for other vaccines. Either way, it's recognised internationally, and it's an easy way to know if a COVID vaccine was administered/which type/when etc.   Here's what they look like:  https://www.thaitravelclinic.com/Knowledge/who-international-certificate-of-vaccination.html  With that said, I find the fact that certain governments are trying to come up with vaccination certificates of their own, a bit ludicrous.

These stickers confirm the batch number, the manufacturer, the production/expiry date of the vaccine etc. The hospital/doc/nurse that administered the vaccine also need to stamp and sign off on the certificate.   The issue is making sure that immigration officers request for the vaccine stickers to be in the booklet, and are made aware of what the different vaccines' stickers should look like. Forging a hospital stamp and a sticker for a vaccine vial, sounds like a lot more pain than getting a jab. Technically, you're right, it's possible for very determined people to pretend they got vaccinated when they haven't...but you could say the same about any paper certificate. Ultimately, unless the data is digitized, anything could be recreated or tempered with.   Having the vaccine-vial sticker on the certificate is common practice.

My situation:   I am South African and we only have around 200 covid cases a day atm but still we are considered a medium risk zone even though some European countries are at 25 000+ a day and low risk... don't understand that logic. Anyway so we needed to apply for the sandbox setup.  You can imagine how stressed we were about our vaccine certificate QR code not being recognised because South Africa is usually behind on everything or not even thought about before the richer countries so there was very little faith it would go through smoothly.  We uploaded through: - Gmail,  - Used ordinary passport - South African vaccine certificate + separate pic of vaccine QR code. Our vaccine certificate showed our ID numbers but not passport numbers (so I wouldn't worry about editing that in like some people have)  - For accomadation we just used our SHABA certificate which we requested from sha+ hotel and entered the SHABA number provided  into the booking ID part. - AXA insurance certificate showed specifically that covid is covered.   I was honestly the most stressed and strung out I have ever been, I registered a few times on different emails, because I was so scared I had done something wrong. I called my countries Thai embassy who could not help, I tried calling that helpline they provided but noone answered, couldnt sleep or eat.. But my girlfriend remained calm and only made one application without reapplying 50 times like me and at the end of the day we both got the approvals and she got hers 1 hour before me!!  That being said, the best advice I can offer is; STAY CALM.

I’m not talking about dual pricing when some street vendor in a tourist part of town tries to scam you.  That kind of stuff goes on everywhere in the world.    I’m talking more about national parks and similar where there is a posted Thai National and Foreigner price displayed.    There, I’ve only seen maybe 100% or 200% maximum.    And that would be off a base price that is ridiculously low to begin with, like 100 baht for Thais and 200 baht for foreigners.     Also, many of those things I mentioned in my previous comment don’t require substantial paperwork.  You picked the most detailed one as an example.  If I go to Disneyland, all I have to show is my CA DL.    A student only needs to show an ID card.  Etc.   I would also add, that “look” is basically laziness.  They don’t ask for every ID because if the person looks Thai and speaks Thai, there’s a good chance they’re Thai.    BTW, it works against them too.  My wife is Thai but holds American citizenship.     When I went to get my vaccination, it was only open to foreigners.  I walked right through and they never even asked for a passport.    She asked, in Thai, if she could get vaccinated too and they told her she couldn’t.    When she told me, I told her to go back and show them her American passport and ask again.    She went back and they gave her a queue number for the vaccine.    They were going to deny her because she looks Thai and speaks Thai.    But, in 99.99% of cases, it’s a correct assumption.  Just like when they didn’t even ask to see my passport.   I could be a naturalized Thai citizen, couldn’t I?     Given the high success rate and the low penalty for being wrong, combined with the added time it would take and longer lines, it’s easier for them to just assume nationality based on appearance.     What’s the harm if one Asian tourist pays the Thai price compared to the long lines that would be involved in checking every ID at the Grand Palace?

The first time i was out in around 45 minutes or so.  Second shot, i was there for 2 hours.  To get to the 9th floor you wait for really slow elevators as people gather all around you. Then everyone crams into the elevator up to the 9th floor.  The entire process is indoors in a narrow L shaped corridor.  There were 9 stops.  9. No reason it couldn't have been 2 or 3. Besides the around 150 or so numbers I heard called while i was there, there were dozens of workers (no wonder all these health workers keep testing positive).  Most of them were unnecessary and shouldn't have been there.  There were no accommodations for covid, it was just the usual snap the ""system"" into place and it hopefully fits what you're trying to do.  The number of people up there and the time spent there should have been limited at every chance.  Nothing was cut out and it could have just as easily been a pre-covid event.  And I don't think the spacing between chairs was sufficient at all.  But it doesn't even matter as much when you are in an enclosed space like that, worsened by the crowds.  The 30 mns waiting time should have been cut out for safety concerns. If someone feels unwell, they can return.  People should have been let go and allowed to remain in the area or not far away.  I've never had more than a cup of orange juice and sent away when vaccinated in the past.   Then i get handed a pathetic little piece if paper that says ""Thailand certificate "" for covid vaccine.  It's useless.  Then i was told I had to go to one of only three places to get a vaccine ""passport"".

One lady checks the papers, then you hand them to a lady at a window at 6.30. At 8 am she calls your name and hands them back to you, telling you to go upstairs where you start again.    So total I spent 5 hours indoors, not including two round trips traveling, in two days.  Probably there will be many posts following telling me I'm a shit head, been it's caused great anxiety.

The problem with the Titer test is that some website speak about ""no less than 3 months after the Titer test you can travel"" and others don't.  It's possible it all just got lost in translation, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.     I do believe that most of it is in order for him to travel with me:  \- international passport   \- chip   \- vaccinated against Rabies his entire life on a yearly basis   \- vaccinated against a collection of other diseases     What I do not understand is the link between the chip and the Rabies vaccine (rabies shot should be visible in chip)?",Turkey,t5_2qlnu,/r/Turkey/comments/r1110i/travelling_to_turkey_with_my_dog/hlw0399/

647,20,3,0,1636614946,&gt;But they blame us because we dont check our airports enough.  &amp;#x200B;  That's not true. Airlines do check if the customers have a valid visa also have a pcr test or vaccine or filled an online form etc. according to rules of the destination country. General security is tighter than many other countries in europe aswell. Normally you don't go through security 2 times because you don't have to. Only requirement is going through security for the clean area and you do that after you go through your passport control. In Turkey there is also a security right at the entrance of the terminal.,Turkey,t5_2qlnu,/r/Turkey/comments/qr4qrl/help_me_understand_what_is_going_on_please_what/hk6dfzj/
648,21,4,0,1635034812,"You either need the hes code to show you are vaccinated or pay for an expensive PCR test every time you enter places  Turkey has vaccine passports in practice for everything. The only thing that is not under a restriction is the grocery markets. They just never called it a vaccine passport but made up a word for ""HES code"".  But we can easily convert it to EU approved vaccine passport through e-government appliances with one click and I believe they call it vaccine passport there  So the debate over vaccine passports from western influences never really entered the Turkish discourse but it is effectively a vaccine passport, it was a smart decision. We had restrictions placed with hes code way before any western country did, you guys over there are actually just following along. We generally don't have much anti vax rheotoric here and muh personal freedoms talk is not a thing either. I mean for other vaccines we used to line up in school for ""vaccine day"" when we were kids to get vaccinated, every Turkish person has that ugly bcg vaccine mark on their arm from school, it was mandatory. That vaccine is also associated with lower death risk from covid if you had it as a kid, so it served us well for lower death rates before biontech. Anti vax discourse is right up along there with flat earther or agartha/ alien believers here so cray cray. Our new centralized health records also has electronic vaccine calendar for kids, those total health records are accessible from schools, family physicians and hospitals when they get your ID number. You can see that screen by googling ""e-nabız""  Don't tell your parents.

My vet filled it out with rabies vaccine dates and it said her breed and age. That was it. I literally tried to give it to the passport control people and they didn’t even look at it. It was very relaxed. My dog was just walking right beside me as well so they could clearly see her. It was hard to find reliable information online but the most up to date info I found was from the Turkish embassy website in America. You could try to reach out to the Turkish embassy from your departing country and ask. But it was honestly very relaxed.
