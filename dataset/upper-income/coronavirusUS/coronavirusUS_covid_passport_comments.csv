In order for the vaccine to end this, we need two things to happen.   1) People will likely need to get booster shots, right now we are looking at every 6 months.

As a scientist at [Johns Hopkins points out](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/a-new-strain-of-coronavirus-what-you-should-know)-   &gt; as with any virus, changes are something to be watched, to ensure that testing, treatment and vaccines are still effective. The scientists will continue to examine new versions of this coronavirus’s genetic sequencing as it evolves.  We have been lucky so far, no major outbreak of a vaccine resistant variant. But a huge percentage of the world is unvaccinated, so the emergence of a vaccine resistant variant is still a possibility, so we have to keep our eye out.

38,0,1618588141,"A mask, keeping distant, washing your hands, having a vaccine -- they all decrease your risk of transmitting or catching COVID, and they do it in an additive way. It's an odds game. Individually, each thing you can do improves your odds of not getting sick, dying, or passing the disease on to someone else who might get sick or die.  I'm not up on the latest numbers of asymptomatic vs. serious cases of COVID, but last I checked the estimate was somewhere around 30-50%.  Also, a lot of those ""asymptomatic"" cases are only asymptomatic in the early, incubation phase of the virus and eventually turn into serious cases. Asymptomatic cases are particularly dangerous in terms of transmission because the carrier doesn't know they have it --  Most reasonable people, knowing that they had COVID, would take extra precautions to avoid giving it to others. If you don't know you have it, you're likely to take fewer precautions and your risk of transmission is much, much higher, especially if you're not able to remain physically distant or if you don't wear a mask.  The reason the jab is important is because it makes your body more efficient at fighting off a COVID infection.  Most of the time, it can completely prevent the infection from taking hold, but in a situation where your body gets overwhelmed with the virus, it can help your body fight off the infection before it becomes too serious. The vaccines very significantly improve your chance of survival.  The reason people want the passports has to do with enabling them to assess their own risk.  Whereas if I walk up to a store and see a bunch of people indoors, not wearing masks, and being too close to each other, I can politely turn around and find another place to shop -- or come back when the shop is empty because I'm not comfortable being maskless around others while COVID cases are as high as they are in my area. With a vaccine, you don't have a physical indicator on your body to show that you're doing what you can to minimize transmission so the passports provide a mechanism to allow people to assess that risk.  If I walk up to a store or restaurant and I see a bunch of people indoors without masks on, but they have all been vaccinated and had to demonstrate it to a bouncer, I can decide whether or not I'm willing to take that risk. Without a passport, I don't know if one of those people could be carriers...",CoronavirusUS,t5_2f86o2,/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/mrptyy/99992_of_fully_vaccinated_people_have_dodged/guqiwdy/

I suspect the Federal government will integrate that requirement with a vaccine credential.   I hope local governments will require COVID vaccination just as they do for other diseases such as polio, smallpox, and measles for attending schools.   I don't care if it's called a passport, a credential, or something else as long as vaccines are verified for venues where others are put at risk by personal choices.   In my view choosing to get vaccinated is a personal choice. Choice has implications.

The Fox News narrative you are trying to push is not based in reality. The article explicitly state the government has zero to do with a conceptual shared way to express vaccine status.  Requiring vaccine OR test is not, NOT what the passport concept is or does.  Requiring a vaccine or test is a government public health order, which is detailed in very specific details through various state laws.   You’re biased, you’re trying to make this a democrat verse republican culture war thing.   This is not your dumb made-up Fox culture war.   The whole point of government is to protect the people. Public health is a major part of that. Same as defense. The implementation of public health guidelines, is NOT culture war. The health system of a given location on has X capacity. When you start risking hospital capacity, society breaks down. If all they can handle is covid, what happens when you have a problem. That’s all. This isn’t whatever Fox is feeding you. It’s making sure the hospital has capacity for your mom if she falls or you get into an accident.   So, I’m done with the circles.

Granted, at some point we'll have to let individuals decide their own level of risk tolerance, knowing that we may never get covid fully under control in this country.
