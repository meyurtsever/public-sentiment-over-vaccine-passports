The incoming of a ""wave"" of sorts is inevitable. Israel has been managing covid exceptionally well had a third peak as equivalent to their first and second, even with a booster dose.

2,1,1635347053,"Where did I ignore the natural immunity, I have mentioned it in a  comment that our natural immunity does not protect us for long. It exists but its not the solution. Not only that what about the fact only 30% of the population is doubly vaccinated to reach a certain  level of herd immunity ? These are not complete protection, \*if\* a new variant strikes , which again can be a possibility there is a good chance the country will again suffer, not as much as the second wave but even then there could be serious problems and we could be forced into a lockdown if shit hits the fan.  70% of our population has taken the vaccine but a recent survey by India today showed 7% of the population still hesitant to take the vaccine. 7 % is 7 crore people (check source) . That number is big enough to create problems. Do I guarantee there will be problems ? NO. Do I fear there will be problems ? YES, as should you.

Vaccines dont work if some people take it and some dont.  The geographical distribution and climatic conditions of those who are unvaccinated could create new variants with localized outbreaks, which can snowball into something else. You should read a little more news before asking people what the fuck they are on about, reflects poorly on you.  Plan B was published officially on September 27. The leaked documents were about the cost it would be and their line of thinking. [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/26/covid-plan-b-uk-economy-cost-leaked-documents).  They are thinking about it, its not a hypothetical. Last time around he tried to do the same deny a lockdown etc and then went on to impose it anyway , how sure are you things will be  different this time ? They might not jump up to a proper lockdown but a mask mandate, vaccine passport and  booster dose is still a real possibility , unless you have a solid argument to deny that they wont ever do it. Israel itself started with the vaccine passport again, what makes you think India is in a better position with 30% fully vaccinated, no booster shots, no kids vaccination in sight. The third wave is here, the cases will rise and the government(s) with its tail tucked between its legs will again impose 8pm curfew and compulsory mask in public.  Capabilities have improved, only because we have vaccinated the population.  I am not wearing a tin foil hat screaming 400k cases a day here, I am still looking towards a significant damage if we are all not too prepared. Which I feel we are not there. Since I am not an expert I will not throw out a random number ,but going by trends I am observing in other countries we might be looking at 100k cases in the third wave and that could be devastating.  Finally, I can very freely criticize the governments chest thumping whenever I want. The person on the chair has been hired to do a job and I am not that person. The chest thumping comment was an observation to what is happening, people have already started being complacent, removing masks and everything since ' capabilities have improved.' I was simply trying to put forward my assessment that the country is getting complacent and I stand by my words.

Before ppl misunderstand, ppl who have got mRNA vaccine shots in few years might proudly remember that they were the first ppl who got mRNA if nothing goes horrible wrong. mRNA has a very large acceptable potential, as full blown gene editing might cause controversy initially. mRNA will probably be used for all(most) of surgeries so as to stop unwanted adhesion if no drug comes along.It can be used for faster healing, cosmetic (change eye color, smother skin, etc), targeted tumor, temporary boost of all most any thing (immune, protein, hormones, etc), many kinds of autoimmune disorders and god knows what.

32,0,1621366473,"Good news, bad news for the three of you - /u/homosapien2014 , /u/Assasin-ed and /u/corporatededmeat. I'm currently sitting at home riding out a sick day from my vaccine shot and since my work has a strict 'No disturbance during a sick day' policy, I have some time to recover, think about what you've mentioned and document it all here, so enjoy.   Let's start with some general notes:   a) **This is strictly about finances.** How your educational and other factors really help to determine eligibility overall, but those can be worked on too.   b) **Assumptions.** I'm assuming in this case that both of you have at least a Bachelors' degree (quite possible) and are (likely) unmarried, given your ages.   c) **Canada as Frame of Reference:** I will be using Canada as a frame of reference for discussions, but you can do your research on other immigration programs to chart out what it would be for other countries - Aus/NZ/EU, etc.   d) **Timelines:** Your move to said country will not be immediate - you need to think long term and your long-term planning needs to be sound because it's not something you can action immediately. You need to do the groundwork, plan and prepare. So if you're thinking about going tomorrow, or next year - stop. What I'm going to talk about below is basically what you need to build towards to breeze through it when you're ready so as soon as the final step is in place, you're a go.   e) **CRS Scores:** When I qualified for the program, I scored a rather high CRS score of 481 which allowed me to move quickly. [Here's a breakdown of my score.](https://i.imgur.com/GDhPLBt.png) But I had something that (I'm assuming) you don't, which was a Masters degree that gave me some more points in the CRS score. For a considerable chunk of points, you should be looking at the following:   i) Under 30 years of age (ideally, unmarried gives you better points than married does, but more on that later)   ii) At least 2 - 3 years of work experience under the NOC code you're applying under  iii) High IELTS General scores - we're talking 8.0 and above on every section, no exceptions  iv) Something that's equivalent to a Bachelor's degree, as per WES. They have an estimator on their website. Obviously, if you have a Master's degree and it is Ontario-equivalent, nothing like it!  [You can find out your current CRS scores here.](https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp)   Now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about specifics:  #Age  **All of you have an advantage here. You're young!** I first thought about moving when I was 28 - I landed in Canada in a month after I turned 30. A lot of the available programs for now really start to penalize you for age after 30, so you all should score high marks in this sector. Additionally, the later you move, the harder it could be to adapt because there's good chance you'll need to start your working life in Canada a rung or two below the position you had in India.   #Current Savings  Before we begin, let's work on trying to build up a 'shopping list' of items that are going to be a part of this adventure:   1. [Proof of Funds](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/proof-funds.html): This is what the government asks you to show that you'll be able to support yourself in your new life in Canada. This is a sliding scale that depends on the number of applicants in your application. In case you do plan to get married between now and then, see one of the sections below about it. Assuming 1 person, for now, the current amount is CAD 12,960 (with today's current forex because of the abnormally high CAD atm, is around INR 7,85,394.92 as of writing this, so around 8 lakhs.)  2. [PR Application fees:](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/apply-permanent-residence.html) CAD 1,325 or INR 80,288.37 , or around 80.5k INR  3. [WES Certification of your degree to show its equivalency to a Canadian bachelors:](https://www.wes.org/ca/evaluations-and-fees/eca/) 220 CAD, or INR 13330.90, so around 13.5k INR  4. [IELTS General Test](https://www.britishcouncil.in/exam/ielts/dates-fees-locations) INR 14,700  5. [India PCC Application](https://www.passportindia.gov.in/AppOnlineProject/fee/feeInput): You'd need to get this done at some point towards the middle of the process. Costs INR 500  6. [PR Medical Expenses](https://www.lilavatihospital.com/Visa-Investigation): Costs associated with doing your medicals for the PR process towards the end of the process itself. Typically costs around  5,000 - 9,000 INR. I got mine done at Lilavati back in 2016, and it was around 7,000 INR.   Those are what I'd call 'The big 6' costs, of which the 'Proof of Funds' isn't even really a cost at all; they're literally showing your savings that you intend to use when you land in Canada. You only need to show you have this and that it's not with any strings attached and you're in the clear.   ***So, with the five real costs outlined, you're looking at a final total of 1,15,819.27, aka 1.15 lakh INR. So with your Proof of Funds, that's about 9.15 lakhs at a minimum.***  Now, there could be other miscellaneous items associated with this too:  a) If you lived in any country other than India (whose cost was already mentioned above) for longer than 6 months within the past 10 years before you plan to apply, you gotta produce a Police Clearance Certificate for each country. That cost can vary depending on the country but it's not terribly expensive relative to the other options outlined above.  b) Married at the point of application? Effectively double some of those expenses, because there are two of you.  c) Training material for IELTS, courier costs...this is going to depend on how you approach it.     Now, to come to specifics on this:   **/u/homosapien2014 :**   You stated 6L as your savings and 13L as your earning capacity for now, you're sitting pretty. You're already about 60% away from the target you need to hit financially.   **/u/Assasin-ed :**   You stated 50k. I wouldn't say you're in bad shape per se, you're also young and my earnings as an artist back then were similar to yours so I can relate.   Having said that, you have ways to go on that front, but again, it's not impossible. Something that nobody tells you is that your family and friends have the ability to 'gift deed' you the balance amount as a way of raising your Proof of Funds. I'm not going to comment on whether that's a possibility in your situation, but I wanted to put it out there as a valid option for you to pursue. I know someone who did that; their dad gave them 5 Lakhs as a gift deed and when he came to Canada and settled in, he earned that money back in short order and gifted it back to his father and bought them a car as a way of saying thank you. 'Nary a dry eye in the audience, etc.   Additionally, like I said before - you're young, your earning capacity can grow and you need to focus on saving. You have a runway of at least 5 years to get the above together.   **/u/corporatededmeat :**   You stated 10L (*Sirf dal kha rahe ho kya, bc?* I didn't have nearly that much in savings when I was 24, lol :D)  Good news for you too, you're already there savings-wise, savings wise but you should add some more and get to work on that work experience, seeing as you're a fresh grad.   **Now, the million-dollar question - what do you need to do to prepare?**  1. Sit down, pen and paper out timelines. Look up the pre-requisites like I mentioned above.   2. Use the first free consultations of a few migration consultants (except Y-Axis, they're *chors*) to get a sense of if you're on the right track. I did this and I found that they were useful and going to them prepared also allows you to see right through their bullshit because often they'll have their own racket going on. Had one of those nitwits tell me my WES ECA was 'wrong' so they'd need to order a fresh one for me. He can suck it, I made it through just fine so he was full of shit and wanted to pocket some extra money because he quoted double what the WES site was actually charging.   3. For things you're not certain about, go [here](https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-discussion-board/) - This is the one source of truth for anything you need to know about Canadian immigration, for example. There will likely be similar communities on Facebook or the internet for the chosen country you want to go to.   4. Set up goals - set up a financial account for immigration money, send your savings there, take stock of how much you've reached for Proof of Funds and for the big 6 expenses. Keep a regular track of this and keep an ear to the rails if something changes so you can modify the plan accordingly. Similar, set milestone dates for when you should start work on getting some stuff done - I can tell you right now that getting the WES is a painful experience because it depends on your university giving a specific document and either mailing directly to them (you know what grade A *chutiyas* Indian colleges are so good luck lol) or giving you a sealed, stamped envelop with the transcripts that you mail to WES for approval.   5. Start digitizing your documents, like... ALL your documents. From your birth certificate to your passport, start scanning and saving two versions of it. A high quality, high file size 'Original Master' and a compressed low-quality version. You'll need to refer to this a lot when you apply. Pay stubs, income tax filing, bank statements, everything. Download and store everything, set up reminders to download this stuff online or go into your bank branch and have them give you everything signed and stamped for your accounts and keep it. You're going to be likely printing out enough paperwork for the application to massacre a small forest, so best be prepared for it ahead of time.",india,t5_2qh1q,/r/india/comments/nezsm0/emigrate_used_to_be_a_meme_on_rindia_i_cannot/gylvdxv/
