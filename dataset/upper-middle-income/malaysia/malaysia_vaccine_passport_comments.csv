Never caught Covid, this despite multiple times being in contact with persons who have tested positive within a few days of contact.  Survivorship bias. But you do you.  &gt; Informed consent. I believe the job of the government is to present its citizens with as much facts as it can and yet leave consent to the individual. I am of the opinion that vaccine mandates are fundamentally wrong. If you don't have sovereignty over your own body, then what do you have left? You might as well not live.  &gt; If someone decides they are not ready to take any vaccine for any reason. That should be their sovereign right. If you are happy to take a vaccine, again, that is your personal right. No one should force anyone else to do anything.  If it doesn't endanger themselves and others, sure. However, this notion of sovereignty would be inapplicable in times of emergency, such as the pandemic we're in.  &gt; Mask mandate &amp; vaccine passport. I don't really know how I feel about this. On one hand I do see the appeal of the wider benefit of keeping the community safe, on the other hand I do not agree that the government should have the right of telling you where you can and cannot go based on whether you have taken a jab. Perhaps leave this to the decision of the individual business owners / shop themselves?  Refer to the above counterpoint. In times of emergency, a unified measure will mitigate the aftermath better.  &gt; No difference in 'user experience' of vaccinated vs unvaccinated. Vaccinated: Can catch covid, can spread covid, can be hospitalised, can die. Unvaccinated: Can catch covid, can spread covid, can be hospitalised, can die.  The science behind COVID is still at its infancy; science ain't a magic bullet. To use an analogy, wearing seat belts can reduce car crash fatalities by thousand folds but idiots will still argue personal freedom and complaining discomfort and inconveniences.  &gt; Never have I ever seen a movement on this scale to coerce people into taking a vaccine, and to dehumanise those who don't comply.   Read up on centuries of human history battling plagues.  &gt; Do not vaccinate the children. I am happy KKM's stance is that vaccination of kids is optional. The death rate of SARS CoV-2 is &lt;0.0115% in children below 12 (per KKM data). This is THE SAME as the death rate of the common cold in children below 12 (per CDC data). So why vaccinate kids?  Because the science behind COVID is not fully understood, and that kids' immune system is still developing.  &gt; Goalposts keep changing. They took your fundamental human right freedoms under the guise of keeping you safe. Then they said you'll get your freedoms back when you get vaccinated. Then they said not good enough, get boosted. No one knows how the goalpost will change next.  Refer to the above counterpoints. The goalpost will always be subject to change. That's not necessarily a bad thing.  As for the remarks on how other countries are handling COVID, do note that their strategies and countermeasures have yet to yield results. For example, Japanese government's natural immunity plan is heavily criticised by their own citizens, especially during the Olympics last year. US, being a beacon of personal sovereignty, most definitely has shown great and tremendous success in combating COVID, right?",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/sd1kd9/malaysian_antivax_group_branching_out_thoughts/huegbur/

I would however like to share some thoughts I have:-  \- Vaccinated, Pfizer 2 doses. Not taken a booster and don't plan to for now.

This is THE SAME as the death rate of the common cold in children below 12 (per CDC data). So why vaccinate kids?  \- Why is the dominant strategy vaccines and not natural immunity? \[Japan recognises natural immunity on par with vaccines\]. The average person who has died from Covid already has 4 comorbidities (CDC data). UK estimates people who ACTUALLY died only from Covid to be about 50,000. Covid is a disease of the aged &amp;  immunocompromised. When was the last time KKM told you to eat well, get enough sunlight, exercise and boost your natural immune system?   \- The virus is real but the response of governments all over the world from the start of the pandemic has been unprecedented and a vast overreach of powers. It is clear, even as recent as today from Denmark, that lockdowns kill economies more effectively than it prevents Covid spread. If lockdowns worked, then everyone in the UAE (which has not had a lockdown since June 2020) should have caught Covid and died by now.  \- Goalposts keep changing. They took your fundamental human right freedoms under the guise of keeping you safe. Then they said you'll get your freedoms back when you get vaccinated. Then they said not good enough, get boosted. No one knows how the goalpost will change next.  That is all.

You are also forbidden to dine in, gyms and not allowed to attend large events such as concerts, parades.   But if you are vaccinated with both doses, you will be exempted from this requirement and you can enjoy the benefits of the vaccinated, such as dine in with 5 pax and above, no masks(save money) etc.   If they take the second dose now before the Malaysian government announces it, they won't have to rush and flock to get vaccinated at last minute like crowds in [France] (https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/more-than-900000-people-france-rush-covid-vaccine-tougher-measures-near-2021-07-13/) which can cause COVID clusters.

25,0,1627399001,"Super long post incoming.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;instead of my friends who criticize me for leaving my job at this crucial pandemic time.  Always remember this one thing, your boss and your colleagues are just your boss and your colleagues. Believe me the company would leave you in their crucial period, even if you were loyal for years. A great boss is rare in Malaysia. At the end of the day, when you grow old one day you will probably look back and you won't even remember most of what you were doing in your 20s career-wise. But you will remember that mum and dad has always been there for you, no matter what. Trust me, all these corporate loyalty especially in Malaysia is just ridiculous considering the Malaysian median salary isn't even good enough to convince anyone that the company gives a shit about any single employee.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Just curious, how are you right now with handling your dad passing?  My dad passed at 59, my dad was a very flawed man. Had affairs, didn't spend as much time with the family as he should have. But he provided a comfortable life for us and gave us anything we wanted. I don't have a super close relationship with my dad like most modern families but his passing still had a huge impact on me. He was always very focused on work and career and I guess in a way I wasn't able to be his ideal son when he was alive, I had just graduated university and for normal parents this should have been enough. But my dad was working with limited time, he always wanted me to show him he could trust me to have a proper career and be independent.   Only when we lose someone, we think about the lost opportunities. He was just a few months short from watching my graduation ceremony, just 2 years short from watching me close my biggest contract in business. I always come back to the question, is he watching me? If he's around just a little longer how joyful he would be .  I wasn't able to see him beam with pride much when he was around, I wasn't given the opportunity to do that. When he passed I was only 22. I guess I personally do not care about showing off any achievements to him, I just wanted to see him very proud just for his last chapter of his life.   I lived with what-ifs for so many years and a part of me still do, but eventually we do move on. Life has to go on, and eventually we will close the book on the previous chapter knowingly or otherwise.  In a way, I accepted his flaws when he was alive and I wish I had done more for him and with him but eventually we all have to move on and life always finds a way to help us move on. I still think about him always, you will never forget your parents but it will be okay.   I really hope this pandemic goes away quickly and you and your mum are able to get that vaccine passport to go to Japan. The situation you have right now is the situation you have right now, at the very least we shouldn't give up hope for something just because it gets scary to hold on to that hope.

34,0,1626102301,"Thanks for your honest response. I hope the discussion can continue without personal attacks.  I'd like to dig a bit deeper to better understand where you are coming from, as I too have encountered a few anti-vax and vaccine hesitant individual.  From what I gather, it's not that you do not take the pandemic seriously, but that you do not trust the authority mandating the vaccine. Is this only at the local scale (incompetent govt), or is it in line with more of the global mistrust (globalist central control agenda)? If not can you help articulate your point of view? I can understand if the mistrust is local, and if the virus is only affecting the region. But seeing that the pandemic is global, and we can see the daily news  countries that have started to open up due to more vaccination, what else would it take to convince you to register? Also do you see any other way free people could tackle the issue of global pandemic without global coordination and support?     Secondly, do you work or have close friends who work with people in the medical field? Do you accept their concern that the longer the virus exists and is allowed to spread, the higher the chance for it to evolve into something more deadly? What are your thoughts on vaccination for people who work at the hospitals where they are exposed to infected people far more than the normal person?     There are many reasons for one to be anti-vax/vaccine hesitant, so is good to be able to have civilized discussion about it. From my own encounter, the most anti-vax person I have personally talked to at length, has a general mistrust of authority both locally and globally. She also came from a religious background that saw current events as fulfilling some biblical prophecy. At one point she also brought up parallels with the 'mark of the beast' to the vaccine, and vaccine passports being a way for the globalist to control human kind. It took a bit of convincing to show that we have always needed some sort of vaccine passport to travel to high risk area. It's just that this is a global pandemic the type we only see once a century, and everywhere is high risk, before the conversation could be brought back closer to reality. It took a few months of discussion before she decided to change her view on the vaccine.  Another vaccine hesitant encounter is not my own but that of a family member who had a friend who also adopted the wait and see approach. She did not register even when her age group has already long been called for appointment. I could not get any further details behind her hesitancy, other than she wanted to ""wait and see"". Unfortunately she contracted Covid in May, admitted to ICU, put on oxygen and had organ failure after 2 months. She passed away recently without her family by her side.  I'm not sharing this to scare you into registering, or forcing my P.O.V on you. Just to share my stories of people I have encountered (not on internet). If other people can share their experience with people they know ( in real life), or their own reasons for choosing not to vaccinate, please share.

35,1,1626106386,"Thank you for your kind response and a civilised discussion. I will discuss with you part by part.    I am from Penang. I am prone to be lone ranger due to my believe. Thats why i am very appreciate that we can discuss this topic peacefully. All my peers are FOMO(Fear of Missing Out) to get the vaccine and I am the only one who do not care about it and i carry on my life as usual. I dont spend much time on this covid issue and i would spend more time on earning money.      Basically, I do not trust the Globalist and the Phamarceutical Corporation. From the beginning of the first day , i felt like its more a Plan-demic than a pandemic. Its like everything is being planned from the first day. I remember i saw one video(i have forgotten what is the name of the video at youtube, i will send you when i recalled). It was posted at September 2019 and the video is talking about ""rehersal of containing a pandemic"" and coincidentally we have the pandemic. From my POV, it is like the Globalist is treating us like a clown. They want a group of mindless people who is obedient and easy to control.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMeqiRVZsyo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMeqiRVZsyo)   Basically, i am just waiting for the herd immunity (80% vaccinated population). Haha, in other way, i am giving my spots to people who want to take the shots.  I do not have friend who is working in the medical line but i do know they are exhausted from the pandemic. Let's just touch a surface discussion on our daily. People have been blaming the local authority for the incompetency of controlling the pandemic. IMO, its all down to rakyat self discipline. I meant during MCO i do witness a lot of people not follow the SOP and do whatever they want, ie group activities w/o mask. Take Taiwan as a case study, they did impose a self lockdown prior goverment imposing it. Regarding to my thought on those doctor who exposed themselves with the patients, i do believe that they have the knowledge how to prevent themselves and they know better than most us what do to prevent from getting it. Props to the frontliners for taking care of this country during this pandemic     Yes, I do really appreciate a civilised discussion on this topic and you are one of the most polite person that i have ever talk with. It wont be surprise that you did open some of my mind in the discusssion. I myself is not a religious person , and yes i do heard the ""mark of beast"" theory and ""insert the chips into our body"". Dont be surprised that i do heard about 5g is related to covid-19 haha. I strongly oppose a vaccine passport and it is taking away our human rights. I do believe that we can win over this pandemic with the history of(Plague disease, Spanish Flu,although it is not a global scale).      I do heard of alot of funny theories on anti vacc as well haha. What i am trying to express is i do not want to blindly follow the crowd for the vaccine. I do not take vaccine due to peer pressure and i think for myself why should/shouldnt i take the vaccine. Do let me know if you have any question.     The following discussion is out of topic discussion. From your discussion , i can know that you are a kind and open minded person. Let's us not forget our peers who need mentally support during this lockdown and do provide assistance to them. I do have friends that is staying outstation alone and the lockdown has constraint them mentally and financially.",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/oil7jw/should_antivaccine_disseminators_be_punished_govt/h4xm9s1/
36,2,1626109868,"&gt; I mean, isn't the standard meaning of Islamaphobia ""an irrational fear of Islam and Muslims""? What other meaning could there be?  You'd think that, but this word has been used and abused in all manner of methods. Same way how sexism and racism has as well. In the game of identity politics, you simply check to see what boxes the victim checks, then accuse the ""oppressor"" of whatever those boxes are linked to. Suppose someone gets fired from a company. Based on their gender, race, age and even religion, they could now level a ton of different accusations towards their company, and even if the company is innocent in all these things, the PR hit would be massive.   Once again, identity politics is commonly abused as both a reactive and proactive method to wrangle a favorable reaction. Which is why I want you to specify what you mean by islamaphobia and not assume I already know.   &gt; Yes but this wouldn't be an irrational fear against Islam and those who follow it but an irrational fear of a certain sect of Islam, which is different.  Potato potatoe. The shia muslims would just argue its shia islamophobia.  Semantics is all it is.   &gt; I doubt this is about islam, it's moreso the implementations of their archaic actions, which they claim to be ""Islam"".  PAS could claim islamaphobia since these actions have never been fully implemented, hence these fears are irrational. I've been dealing with identity politics for more than a decade, and trust me, at the end of the day its not the rational reasoning that wins out, but rather the loudest and most SOB voice.   &gt; Disagreement or misunderstanding of following certain rules/laws of Islam is not Islamaphobia, it's just a set of preferences.   No its not. In Malaysia (Islam) as a general rule, conversion is usually irreversible. Not to mention your children are born into the religion, and will have a hard time converting out if they try. In some of the more primitive nations, attempts to convert will result in murder and honor killing.   &gt; (IMO Anyone being introduced into a damn religion would be quite shooketh, especially if it's an abrahamic religion).  None of the other abrahamic religions are this effed up about conversion and apostacy. Also, neither Judaism nor Christianity demand people convert to their religion before marrying one of their own. In other words, this is an irrelevant argument.  &gt; But it could be, and atleast in the states, it is. People are denied rights that others can enjoy because they are Muslim (like being denied jobs, housing,protection, etc).  Earlier you mentioned ""preference"". So let me ask you this. How do you separate preferences and oppression? What if society as a whole reject gay relationships? Its a preference for gay people to choose their partners, so if a huge majority of people in society prefer straight partners, would you consider it an oppression of gay people?   My take on the whole ""oppression"" idea is that its oppression if its done in the context where fairness must be upheld with the intent to cause harm. Note the extremely specificness of it. There must be intent to cause harm, and it is done in the context where the withheld service/products/treatment is offered to everyone else.   &gt; While I agree that many people use these words baselessly, they are actual things that plague society and should be discussed. Letting people get away with using these words baselessly actually worsens the problem. For example, if you call everyone racist, it would diminish the meaning of that word over time, making instances of actual racism harder to point out and solve. That's the whole point of me starting this discussion: to make people realise that they are not oppressed because they are Muslim in Malaysia, and to stop using the word baselessly because it's disrespectful towards those who actually go through it. Obv one reddit post isn't going to enlighten everyine over night, I still did it anyway coz I like discussing these things.  I think this is the part where we both shake hands because we both agree on the definition and potential solution of the problem, but disagree on where the slider bars land and specifics. Again my whole argument can be encapsulated with the following:  &gt;  Letting people get away with using these words baselessly actually worsens the problem.  Which again, is why I want people to specify and define their accusations before even giving them the time of day. Its pretty much built into the way I behave, which is why I respond the way I did. Its done in a way where people cannot accuse me of being unsympathetic, but at the same time its done in a way to out a liar if they are one.   Ultimately I think its best if people dont mix the concept of oppression with the concept of islamaphobia as it blurs the lines and just makes it even harder to define and discuss each topic. Oppression simply defines as the exercise of authority or power in a cruel and harmful fashion. Again, keywords being authority and power. A baker refusing to sell you a cake is not being oppressive. A group of bakers refusing to sell you a cake is not being oppressive. A group of bakers colluding to refuse to sell you a cake on the other hand, can be said to be oppressive, since by colluding againts you, they establish an authority or power that you dont have.   On the other hand, government servants engaging in these on the personal level can be defined as engaging in oppression, since they're obliged to carry out their duties fairly, and being a government servant provides them access to a variety of authoritarian powers to coerce you into complying. Case in point, if you tried to apply for a vaccine passport and the government employee demands a 1000% fee, you cannot refuse, because if you do, that government employee can file a police report againts you for running around without a vaccine passport. A private agency cannot do this, even if its within a corporation since there are and always will be methods to deal with this, including quitting, complaints made to the appropriate government body, and so on. Oppression can occur from a variety of things, and it often isnt done as a result of irrational fears. More often than not its as simple as a power trip, laziness, sadism or greed. People in power in general do not engage in petty oppression if they have an irrational fear of something; they take any and all actions to crush it as well as warn off future acts. This is why police in Malaysia take such harsh actions on people engaging in sedition, as opposed to... extorting people for money if they catch them with a packet of cocaine.",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/oiimbh/are_malaysian_muslims_entitled_to_say_i/h4xvn9h/

LRT is super empty, to a point you can lie down on the seat or the floor. Granted this was around 2pm, but it kinda bizarre experience. 2. PWTC routing / queue changed abit, usually I come from behind entrance near Putra Mall and Hotel... Pacific? after going down from elevated walkaway from LRT. Now it is forced to go around from the main entrance 3. There is 2 entrance for vaccination, 1 for 1st timer and mine is 2nd dose. Oh gosh, I reached there around 3pm and feel like Im elderly group that go straight to registration, vaccination &amp; observation area in just 10 minutes! 4. Some miscommunication made us wait about 25 minutes before let go. Basically some announcement on how vaccination passport work. 5. The ""I have vaccinated"" photobooth now is near the back entrance, but when I went there there is no staff to help so i didnt take any picture. 6. Afterward I just went to Putra Mall to go for some grocery shopping (I havent go out of house for 8 weeks afterall). They quite strict (must not have ""high risk"" in mysejahtera).  Take note entrance near LRT is closed  7. The mall looking like super sad. All shops are closed, most of that still open are food with some foodpanda / rider walking around. Lots of people were in Cold Storage, but I just go quickly and went back home. 8. At the moment, after I took panadol every 6 hours, I still have slightly ... ""feel like fever"" and nothing else. I was abit concerned because I was gaming till morning (day before vaccine) and had only sleep like 2 hours. Nothing bad so far.   Thats all folks. Thanks for reading.

Economic influence comes into play with vaccine as it will allow free travel like we used too.

South America accepts sinovac more widely compared to North America where Pfizer has more acceptance. Saudi still won’t accept sinovac vaccinated person for now.

47,2,1624260912,"I'm still not sold on this whole vaccination passport idea. Two core reasons, first being that the current vaccination program at any time risks being rendered obsolete when the virus mutates into a form that is completely immune to all existing vaccines. We're already seeing reports that say that Pfizer is less effective (AZ even more so) againts the India variant. Its been only about 18 months (21 if you count the 3 months China did an information blackout to hide the pandemic in its early stages in Wuhan) since the virus made its debut on this planet.  &amp;#x200B;  Second being that when herd immunity is achieved worldwide, most nations probably wont give a hoot about these passports because their own citizens are already vaccinated. This idea applies for most vaccinable diseases, where we dont have any sort of vaccine passports for them, despite some of them posing a much higher threat than Covid for a nation's population.  &amp;#x200B;  Honestly tho, I hope that Malaysia continues to accelerate towards herd immunity, and in the future make the vaccines widely available to the public via private practices. Once this is achieved, the need for ""vaccine passports"" will be drastically reduced, and by then we'd be able to dismiss the need for it.

But then for US to have that they have use some consistently good vaccine and they're almost half of the country vaccinated, but since we have multiple vaccine of varied efficacy thrown into the mix(like sinovac for example) , i'd say we still too early for no mask to work, and imo will have to wait till 50% in that state for it to be low enough risk(if we roll out the vaccine equally then 40% in penang will be the same as 40% in kelantan, but that will have to depend on KKM and JAV). Our implementation should be pretty simple too, since we have the vaccine passport in mysejahtera, we could just show it when asked, and like CDC recommended, some place still required the SOP so we'll be the same as them. Copy pasta is our strong suite after all.   But what we could do right away is to allow interstate travel for fully vaccinated individual. That way we could both incentives the vaccinated individual and also pull forward the recoveries of the tourism industry, that one hit the hardest and are still being choked imo",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/nbpw2z/rmalaysia_daily_random_discussion_and_quick/gy26ihq/

61,0,1620275718,Hmm. That's true as well. Seems like the best info I got after scouring the net has also been that vaccine passport is only viable after a certain percentage of population has been inoculated and also the progression of the pandemic in the country (time). Sounds unlikely for Malaysia soon though. That kinda sucks. Thanks for the ideas!,malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/n5p1yc/rmalaysia_daily_random_discussion_and_quick/gx465pk/

77,0,1613460984,Vaccination passport is quite inevitable for many of the countries that do not have the capabilities to vaccinate the entire population quickly to reach herd immunity. While waiting for herd immunity to be achieved vaccination passport will be issued to certain group of people so that economic activities can proceed.  There will be problems with countries not recognize the vaccination passport thats why the government need to discuss with other countries and made a agreement before things can proceed. Go small first with few neighbouring countries and then if everything goes well then we expand to other country.  I can totally see this vaccination passport get politicized locally and internationally.  Countries will discriminate against types of vaccine other countries especially those who inject their rival's. Propaganda will be flying all over the news papers accusing those vaccination passports were not reliable.,malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/lky42r/vaccination_may_be_passport_to_travel_says_pm/gnmieoe/
