0,0,0,1643891282,"&gt; Vaccinated tested covid-free NZ citizens  Having travelled on international flights in the last couple of weeks this is just entirely false. They're literal plague ships. Border control and airlines have no idea (literally zero) about what they're doing when it comes to an airborne virus, they make everyone lower their masks for a few seconds while they match your face to your passport photo, also again before boarding each flight. The virus lingers in the air for hours in areas with poor airflow, so this in itself is enough time to get people infected. Then onto the plague ships, everyone wears whatever masks like cloth/surgical etc which leak aerosols out the sides or through the mask. Then on the long 12+ hour flights it's very hard to not eat or drink anything so everyone is removing their masks at the same time to eat and drink. In each plane section (length of the space between the bathrooms at front and back) there was at least 2 people coughing in different areas. On my second last flight from Dubai I had people coughing directly behind me, directly in front and directly to the sides. I would say it's almost impossible not to get exposed on one of these flights. You could do N95 all trip and not eat or drink, but with all the indirect routes these days e.g. via Dubai that's going to be a tough 24+ hours, also you can still be exposed via the passport/boarding process.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/siwq22/covid19_nz_border_reopening_to_begin_from_late/hveu0ms/

19,19,0,1640769663,"Yes, the lockdowns initially were justifiable, we needed time, there were too many unknowns. The second lockdown was a direct result of labour's incompetence and shortsightedness. They should have pushed vaccines earlier to higher risk groups.  By your argument we can justify an inconvenience to another person if it saves their life. I agree. This is a reasonable cost, if it's minor and I also expect it to make sense and be voluntary. However, much more than a minor inconvenience is not a good idea. It's simply not clearly beneficial to use a coercive (i.e. harnessing the force of the state) method for enforcing this. A restaurant being fined 20k is in my view disproportionate to the risk, and heavy handed. No one wants people to die... (do I need to even say this?) but a vaccine passport is --not-- going to prevent that at this point... in a town with zero covid community cases it does not make sense to be using the current approach. To suggest that we hold off everyones lives so that people can live in a bubble is not realistic, and it's frankly pretty selfish.   If your dad wants to minimise his risk then he should get the vaccine (and booster), and should also avoid smoking, should exercise regularly and eat a plant based diet. Obesity is a key risk factor so I hope he's been exercising for the last 18 months so that he is less likely to end up in ICU... Do you catch my drift here? The current narrative is not focused on individual responsibility, but rather the sacrifices that every has to make for high risk people. Maybe I'm high risk, there's no point in including my own medical history here. It doesn't change my view point here. Protect the vulnerable and incompetent, reduce your own factors for severe disease where able, and proportionally to your own assessment of the risks from covid. Vaccination appears to be very effective against the more deadly strains but of less help against omicron (which is weak anyway). Effective social distancing helps. Signs and QR contact tracing are only as helpful as the rules and enforcement. The way we use them currently is stupid, and fining this restaurant is more of Jacinda's unnecessary bullshit.

20,20,0,1640488178,"Why are Kiwis so unafraid of losing their job? In this whole house price madness, I never see mentioned the risk of job loss.   NZ unemployment figures are largely nonsense, with underemployment, contract work, and fixed-term work hugely overrepresented.  If you lose a decent job in NZ, the size and lack of equivalent opportunities can make finding a new one difficult. However, Kiwis continue to pile into buying some of the most expensive properties in the world on some of the lowest salaries in a limited market.  When property risk is discussed, it’s usually about interest rates, but unemployment seems like a much more significant risk especially when leveraged up to the neck.  I can kinda understand that bullishness in Wellington, where govt money for professional services and public sector employment is pretty much the only game in town. Still, the risk for most workers outside of that protected circle is disproportionately high.  As property prices strip the economy of discretionary spending and Covid moves to close and restrict businesses, there’s a sequence of events around interest rate rises, stricter lending, and more demanding work requirements that will gut the market of buyers, and you can’t realise gains without willing buyers.  Lending and related issues will bring about the end of the runaway market. No money = no movement.   …and anyone that thinks there is an army of cashed up Kiwis desperate to return from overseas to buy some of the worlds most expensive and poor quality housing is delusional.

It has to be stopped. Lockdown already planned for January. The fiat banking system of which everyone uses is going to be collapsed from mid 2022 onward therefore all mortgages will be ended and the NWO digital currency introduced. Titles will be handed over to the State Government and lease agreements will be introduced for the property's people once owned. This will bring in the social credit system whereby you have to fully comply or you lose points and the privlage to continue the lease on your property or business. Failing to fully comply means they can simply cut everything off from you by the push of a few buttons leaving you with no access to any money to feed yourself. This is how they have planned to remove people from there property's especially the rural areas. Remember Ardern saying the days of dairy farming are over? Well this is what she meant by it. All assets will be owned by the State. Welcome to the first time the western world was ever pushed into Communism and we are the generations that allowed it by not standing up to fight against it. Ardern, Helen Clark, and all the commys of the party's must be laughing there heads off at how stupid the people have been to totally get sucked in and comply their way to full Communism and just handed their freedoms away because of the common flu. All is done and dusted in the next few months unless all the people stand up and fight back. Everything you ever worked for is about to be all taken from you. Anyone silly enough not to believe it then tell us all how they took three water assets from us when most councils said no.( because they had already made the sale to multi corporations) Explain how legislation got put through to remove titles and why they would do so. Explain SNA land grabbing and tell us what can't be classed as significant area. Explain why a health Minister can now order the destruction of buildings on your property just by saying so. Either rise up now or we might as well just hand over everything we have. Once the banks are collapsed try proving you are the rightful tittle holder. Because unless you hold the original copy with proof you owe nothing on it they will be seizing the titles and only offer a lease agreement back. That's if you are taking your 3 monthly booster shots of which will probably be monthly or weekly by then. Refuse and lose, that's how China control the people by the social credit system. Anyone who applied or applies for a jab passport has entered themselves into the social credit system. Now do we understand why the push to jab everyone including the children? Because they need everyone done to be coded for the new system. Remember the push for digital ID of all animal stock and how they used a so called deadly disease to encourage all the farmers to enter into it at a cost paid by the farmers and after compliance just what happened to that fatal disease that they had to slaughter whole herds for of which no cows had died only were slaughtered and killed instead because of so called positives.  Funny that because the PCR test also gives close to 100 percent false positives. Sars-Cov-2 which is covid 19 was patented in 2005 and in 2012 recorded in medical journals as the common flu. That's why we all never died of a deadly virus people. Yet while they had people locked down fearing for their lives they rushed new laws through to remove our freedoms and rights. But hey if you think complying to this corruption by wearing a mask, producing a passport to do things like eat out FFS or go watch a movie or have a day at the Christmas races, concert or whatever let alone supply a passport to work and earn a living then you probably need to take a serious look and think about what you have already given away.

Consider an unrepentant paedophile who is sexually attracted to children and refuses to participate in therapy to change this.  They were not convicted of a crime, however because it is known they are a higher risk of causing harm to children than the general public, there has been restrictions put on where they are allowed to go, and who they can interact with to decrease the chance of harm.  In this scenario, you are arguing that while you aren't attracted to children, you hate the thought that someone who is a greater risk of preying on children being kept apart and not being allowed to go to swimming pools and schools where they are near children.  The vaccine passport is meant to serve 2 purposes - to keep a physical separation for the purposes of protection, and by the fact people want to avoid that separation, to encourage them to get vaccinated and thus remove the increased risk which warrants that protection.  I understand the idea that from a moral standpoint it doesn't seem right that there are limitations being put on some people...but it's intended to protect people from legitimate medical risk.  We pretty much have to be around strangers, but we don't have to be around strangers who also have considerably-higher risk of being infected and infectious.  From a practical standpoint, so long as we can't vaccinate all children against the virus (and children can expose adults and higher-risk people to the virus) we are no-where near the requirements for herd immunity where it would be acceptable from a standpoint of medical risk...to increase the risk for us all by removing the location restrictions from those who represent that higher risk.  There are probably more at-risk people in NZ who are immunosuppressed or have other reasons why Covid would cause them imminent danger who would feel the need to restrict themselves to protect themselves....than the number of anti-vaxxers who would benefit from being allowed to join them in closed, indoor, higher-risk locations.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/rhbsgx/covid19_milestone_90pc_of_new_zealanders_are_now/hoqcxuh/

33,33,0,1639256308,Of course you can see your sister. The whole point of the restrictions is to reduce spread between people that do not have the vaccine. It keeps them safe and stops us from having a runaway covid spread between people without vaccine.   I feel like people fall for the misinformation of anti-vaxxers that paint the restrictions as some way to punish and exclude them.  By default we would have to restrict everyone because we have active covid spread in many parts of the country. Thanks to the vaccine passport the people with vaccine can have more freedom because their action reduce the spread. The people without vaccine require more social distancing to reduce the spread thus different restrictions apply.   This is all the light system does. It tweaks the rules based on how high the risk of active covid spread is and based on your own personal risk (vaccinated vs not). It is not there to punish anti-vaxxers.

59,59,0,1638063022,"&gt; So as I suspected, you're not looking at the whole picture. &gt;  &gt; Freedoms are defined by laws and such laws tend to be delicate. Adding something like a vaccine pass that allows organisations to block service to specific individuals needs to go through the proper checks and balances to make sure its limited to just what is required, doesn't over step and doesn't have loopholes that could be used for other purposes.   None of this happened though. In fact, you have the facts pretty much exactly opposite to what actually happened.   First factual error: The law had not even been drafted at the time the government commissioned the vaccine passport system. This is because it's not actually necessary to decide the *legal* details of the implementation at the time you make the app - you can develop the app first, and then decide when and where it must be used. Conclusion: The government waiting for long legal processes was not the cause of our slowness.    Secondly, when the legislation was eventually introduced - on 23rd November - it *bypassed* all the normal checks and balances. It passed less than 24 hours after it was first introduced. In the words of Dr Dean Knight (Assoc. Prof. Victoria University, member of NZ Centre for Public Law, co-chair of Australasian chapter of the International Society of Public Law, executive committee member of the Law and Society Association of Australia and New Zealand (LSAANZ), editorial committee of the NZ Journal of Public and International Law):  &gt;It is a constitutional disgrace that the legislation mandating this vaccination regime is being passed urgently this week, without provision for prior/adequate consultation on the legislative framework. Whether you support the new Covid protection framework (which I do) or not, legislative change seriously implicating rights like this needs much more time to breathe, to be interrogated and for its legitimacy to be built through dialogue. *From a quick look, also concerning is the framework is empowering only, leaving much of the detail of the protection framework/vaccination mandates to be settled in Covid-19 orders made by the minister. Again, quite concerning - esp given the novelty of the measures* ...That perhaps a suite of further judicial review applications challenging vax mandates in the new year... Joy. 🙄  He goes on to list a variety of other problems with the rushed process in [this 56 tweet long thread \(make sure you scroll all the way to the top\)](https://twitter.com/drdeanknight/status/1463200066592591878). I think an esteemed public law expert describing something as a ""constitution disgrace"" ought to trigger some alarm bells, and clearly indicates checks and balances have not been followed.    The part in italics is important and I'll return to that later, but first lets look at a non-comprehensive list of other public law experts who have critiqued the government in incredibly strong terms for *bypassing* all the checks and balances that they could have gone through if they had started things earlier:  * [NZ Human Rights Commission](https://www.hrc.co.nz/news/scrutiny-and-public-input-needed-urgently-new-covid-19-legislation-says-human-rights-commission/) * [New Zealand Law Society](https://www.lawsociety.org.nz/news/law-society-statements/law-society-raises-concerns-about-passage-of-covid-19-response-vaccinations-legislation-act-2021/) * [Trevor Mallard \(A Labour MP! and speaker of the house\)](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/127082246/speaker-trevor-mallard-lashes-government-for-urgently-passing-covid19-law?cid=app-iPhone) * [Geoff McLay \(Prof. Victoria University, Former Law Commissioner, Former Chair of the Legislation Design Advisory Committee, Editor of NZ Law Reports\)](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/127082246/speaker-trevor-mallard-lashes-government-for-urgently-passing-covid19-law?cid=app-iPhone) * Every party in parliament other than Labour * [Eddie Clark](https://twitter.com/Publicwrongs/status/1463230874695061506) (Senior Lecturer Victoria University)  Regarding the italics: One of the issues Dr Knight raises is that the legislation that passed is actually incredibly incomplete - the existing legislation doesn't actually contain most of the framework, but just gives the minister of covid-19 response sweeping powers to implement a whole bunch of orders that will eventually become the framework. To be clear, the parts of the law that mandate the use of the vaccine certificates cannot have gone through checks and balances, because those parts of the laws do not exist yet - they exist only when Chris Hipkins issues a public health order.   This is known as secondary legislation. According to the government's own legislation advisory committee, the framework would clearly be more appropriate for primary legislation:  &gt; As a general rule, matters of significant policy and principle should be included in an Act. Secondary legislation should generally deal with minor or technical matters of implementation and the operation of the Act ... The following matters should generally (or in some cases always) be addressed in primary legislation:  &gt;* matters of significant policy; * matters significantly affecting fundamental human rights; * the creation of significant public powers such as search and seizure or confiscation of property;    - http://www.ldac.org.nz/guidelines/legislation-guidelines-2021-edition/issues-particularly-relevant-to-empowering-secondary-legislation-2/chapter-14/  I'm sorry, but if you think the reason our response has been slow is because the government is going through all the checks and balances, you just haven't been paying attention.    &gt;There's also the fact that it's revealing medical information so that needs to be checked too.  That's a really, really good reason to sign the contract and get everything in motion *earlier*, so developers aren't rushed. More development time = more time can be allocated to testing to find and quash security issues.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/r34wd0/jacinda_ardern_says_new_zealand_is_prepared_for/hmcgrxx/

As to the media, they 100% were gas lighting people and labeling people as conspiracy theorist who believed that boosters would be required and that vaccine passports will be a reality. Many ordinary people believed this vaxxed or un vaxxed, many experts also acknowledged this possibility too. It is the media that has unnecessary delivered 'anti vaxxers' a complete victory on these topics throught their reckless coverage.   As for vaccine passports not being 'new', I do disagree there.  A vaccine passport on this scale and with this wide of a reach with consequences as sever as they are under this new framework, there really is no historical equivalent in my view and certainly in theirs too.   The way I see it, there are two factors at play with these Covid-19 restrictions and either side of the argument is choosing to deny the existence of one of them. 1 is public health and 2, is about government controll. Most of the 'anti vax' or 'anti Covid vax' groups see all of this purely as an attempt by governments to gain more power and use said power to fundamentally change society, many believe that this has nothing to do with public health because they they think Covid is either fake, or a slightly bad flu season.   For the staunchly pro vax groups (yes they exist and they're arguably just as bad as anti vaxxers with regards to misinformation and constant moaning), they believe this is all about public health, and that there are no opportunistic power grabs going on, no abuse going on, no sinister underlying motives. It's all rather naive in my view to see governmentsas this benevolent organization that will always has our best intentions at heart. They have a level of trust in their government that anti vaxxers don't share, so while they're willing to giver government the benefit of the doubt  anti vaxxers aren't.

Unless the government is going to require 4-6 monthly booster shots for everyone to maintain their vaccine pass and universal mask wearing for the foreseeable future then cases will continue to rise and chances of breakthrough infection goes up along with your chances of long covid which can still happen.

So not getting hospitalised then becomes a two dice roll every time you go to the supermarket, mall etc and hoping not to get snake eyes.

118,118,0,1636481362,"I'm in a similar boat to you.   Vaccinated myself but disagree with mandates for a few reasons:  1. I'm not convinced that the ""social tensions"" that arise from locking \~10% of the adult population out of employment, recreational opportunities etc are worth it for the extra percentage of vaccine uptake. There will be collateral damage here that is hard to quantify and make take some time to fully make its effects felt. For example mum and dad are anti-vax so lose their jobs ... the kids - through no fault of their own - experience a substantial decline in standard of living, opportunities etc. No doubt this also risks fuelling extreme behaviour from some (take away people's ability to feed themselves and see how they can start to behave) It may feel cathartic now to see anti-vaxxers be punished, locked out of society and so on, but I believe in time we will see that as having been a bad idea as the ""long tail"" of effects from this is felt.  2. Looking at health expert insight from European countries like Germany, there seems evidence the Covid passport system is potentially worsening Covid's spread. This is because the vaccinated believe they are ""invincible"" (or at least 'the average Joe' does because he/she has been sold the idea that Covid vaccines are infallible) so they drop all other protective measures e.g. frequent hand washing, mask wearing, social distancing etc. The layperson still believes that Covid vaccines work like the ones you had has a kid - i.e. you take the vaccine and then you cannot really get infected or transmit the disease. However, Covid vaccines seem to work more like 'symptom mitigators' (at least after a short while) so you can still get spread amongst the vaccinated. Look at Waterford County in Ireland for example - around 99.5% of adults are fully-vaccinated there, but they have some of the worst case growth in all of Ireland. At the same time the unvaccinated will be driven underground to meet in private, where there is far more chance that Covid spreads aggressively through that community. 3. There are a number of promising treatment products (e.g. new Pfizer pill) coming down the pipeline. These should help to keep hospitalisations lower, and ultimately may prove more effective than vaccination.  4. The implementation here seems arse about face. Isn't the point that once we hit 90%, modelling has projected that we won't see the health system overrun? Therefore, once we hit 90% (which is when the traffic light system is meant to kick in with the Covid passport) why do we need the restrictions in the first place?",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/qq82bl/important_update_daily_covid19_discussion_thread/hjyp95d/
119,119,0,1636399882,"Of course.  IIRC it's Germany where a number of health experts have come out and said that this is a specific issue with the vaccine passport system and is contributing to the growing number of cases there - vaccinated people tend to behave as if they are at no risk of spreading Covid (because to the layperson a vaccine stops you getting the disease - whereas Covid vaccines seem to work more like symptom mitigators after a short period of time) so they just behave as they would have done pre-Covid, e.g. going to events, shops, transport etc if they feel under the weather.  Ultimately this isn't an issue if we are moving to a 'post-case number' world, but it will be interesting to see if the same pans out here.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/qphykv/air_nz_domestic_passengers_will_have_to_be_fully/hjua1zs/

If this means the unvaxxed lose their ""freedoms"" that come with being a ""free country"" (as per your own words) so that the contributing citizens gain back our freedoms. Then I say go.   Once we've got that sorted we can start opening up borders to certain countries, provided they have a vaccine passport.   Again if giving people back freedom of movement and freedom of travel means the parasites have less freedom that's their problem.   &gt;What freedom do you want back so bad?  As you said it's a free country aye? Do Aucklanders look like we're living in a free country right now? No. Why? To avoid screwing up the hospitals. Why is this an issue? Unvaxxed parasites.  Why is their ""freedom"" of being in ""free country"" more important than the ""freedom"" of the other 86% of New Zealand?  &gt;focus on our own problems for a while before pandering to foreign money.   Exactly where are we going to get the funding to fix our own problems? Thin air? The ever blowing national debt because of covid? (which I support btw. We needed that money)  Nah. Again. Those of us who contribute to the betterment of society can reap the benefits of society. Those of us who didn't contribute voluntarily can lie in their bed. As you said previously ""it's a free country"" the freedom to choose includes the ability to bear the burden of their choice  Thet made their choice to be parasites.

181,181,1,1635066062,"Happy to engage in a conversation on this, as I have been really struggling to find people who wish to discuss actual facts and how they are arrived at. As opposed to the rhetoric which seems to be really derisive among so many these days.  Because I certainly don’t claim to have any sort of medical training, you will have to bear with me on some of my questions. - 31 were unlikely to be caused by Covid. How was this conclusion arrived at, and who came to this conclusion . What is the basis or parameters that the MoH uses to define this? - 26 do not have sufficient information for a conclusion. Who arrived at that decision, and based on what? It seems strange that in this current Covid aware environment, that anyone who passed away, within a short time of receiving medical treatment, that the information required about these situations is unavailable. Our hospital aren’t currently so stretched, that basic and important reporting isn’t being performed. - the 6.5 million doses given out , 70% of those its a second dose, so your maths needs to be changed to reflect that, your maths is based on people and then you base it on doses. You also havent allowed for the number of people in that 50 000 who dispite being vaccinated will still die. It needs to be in there for accuracy.  However even when you account for that I agree that the numbers still stack up for vaccinating over unvaxxed. Across the vast majority of the age groups. But i still believe all we can do is put the information in front of people, so that informed choices can be made by all of the hesitating ones, rather than the current course of continued, them and us policy’s.  You very obviously have an interest or strong knowledge on this subject, so I would also be interested in your thoughts around the vaccine itself.  From what information I have managed to gather and read (some of it I am still having to reread to make sure I have understood things correctly) the Pfizer vaccine seems to be the pick of the bunch for results available at this point. It seems to have performed the best in both reducing the likely hood of vaccinated people catching Covid and also when vaccinated people do catch it, the Pfizer vaccinated people seem to have the least amount of hospital admissions and severe symptoms. So from what i can see our government has made the right choice on which vaccine to go with.  Once I started looking at the vaccine itself (so far I have had a couple of discussions with Doctors I know, who both work in ICU units in Chch and Wellington, and then since those discussions I have used a couple of different sources to try and research the chemistry behind the vaccine, mainly the British medical journal and then links to different studies from this source. If any of the questions i am about to ask you dont sound right or you think i have got it wrong let me know and i will find the links i used to get this info). I would also add that i fully understand a lot of the work around this particular vaccine has had to be forced and rushed to allow whats effectively the pick of the bunch to be out there and being used.  The part of the vaccine I am struggling to fully understand is the PEG2000. I understand its the delivery system for the spike, that activates our immune system, to combat the virus. If i understand things correctly, the issue they have is the spike only has a very short life span, once its in our blood, and generally will be dead (i presume killed by our existing antibodies, but i am only guessing at that) with in a very short time of entering our system, it needs to survive for 2 to 3 weeks to do its job properly. The PEG2000 coats the spike in a protective coating to allow it to survive for the required time before breaking down naturally in our body. PEG2000 is polyethylene glycol . Polyethylene glycol is manufactured from polypropelene glycol. It’s manufactured by adding ethylene oxide with the polypropelene glycol. The byproduct of this chemical reaction is a number of extremely carcinogenic components. These are then removed and you are left with the polyethylene glycol. This has a number of uses in the medical industry, but has been predominantly used as a laxative, taken in oral form.  The main use it has had (prior to being used in the current Pfizer vaccine) in a intravenous use, has been used as a delivery system for some very strong chemotherapy drugs. When the British medical journal decided to run some trials on the effects of PEG2000 when used in a intravenous form, the only use was for delivery of chemo drugs. The conclusion they came to (released in June 2019 you can find it on their web site) was that it worked very effectively in allowing the clinicians to deliver the correct drugs to the intended target in the body. However they also put a rather significant disclaimer with it. They also found that due to the large amount of damage done to the patient by the chemo drug itself, it was impossible to tell if any of the issues were caused by the PEG2000 or the chemo drug. They concluded that while it looked promising a lot more work was required to ascertain what the medium and long term effects of this chemical will be on our bodies. They also mentioned that Quality control in the manufacturing process was going to be critical, as even trace amounts of the carcinogenic byproducts from manufacturing would be deadly with a number of different cancers particularly lymphatic cancers.  By necesity there hasn’t been time to complete any of these trials. So effectively we are Guinea pigs for this delivery system, rather than it going through the standard medical trial system.  Pfizers have been forced to ramp up their manufacturing enormously to allow them to try and supply world wide demand. What has been done to ensure a private company that is profit focused, is also totally committed to a QC system to ensure that during this enormous and no doubt challenging manufacturing ramp up process that QC isn’t suffering, as obviously the long term down sides could be very significant.  Again I am not saying that the current vaccine has these carcinogenic by products or that the PEG2000 is going to cause us issues. However i also cant get any powers to be or people in control of our response to engage on these issues either. It’s always either ignored, or i am given the answer that these are things that are at a higher level and i dont need to know about it, we must just trust the powers to be.  I am sure you can understand that answering questions that people have, with those type of responses, only makes most people want to find out more information.  For the record I am vaccinated for the following - Hepatitis A and B - Cholera - TB - Polio - yellow fever - Tetanus I spent 10 years living in different parts of Africa, and had to be vaccinated for all of these items, I still have my international vaccine passport. I experienced two Cholera outbreaks in the place i lived and saw the devastation this created on the unvaccinated. We also had to constantly be aware of hepatitis outbreaks in the water. So I believe myself to be far from a anti vaxxer (most of the ones I have ever met, are mad). My concerns are around the speed this has been brought to being considered safe. I totally understand we needed something to combat what has been sweeping the world, but it worries me that these basic questions I have, I am really struggling to get straight answers on. Thanks for your previous reply and i look forward to hearing your thoughts",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/qdq7az/im_trying_to_convince_my_friend_to_get_vaccinated/hhuby08/

We want high rates of vaccination but that's not the way we want to try and encourage it.""  - Jacinda Ardern   &gt;Some countries required ""health passes"", mandatory proof of vaccination or a negative test, including for indoor events like sports games and concerts, and hospitality.   &gt;One country was France, which had mandated health passports for visitors to major domestic attractions such as the Eiffel Tower, and would soon make it mandatory for people to visit bars and restaurants, sparking outrage amongst its residents.  Quotes from source 2:   &gt;Some countries are also requiring ""health passes"", mandatory proof of vaccination or a negative test, including for indoor events (such as sports games and concerts) and hospitality — triggering anti-restriction protests in the process  ...  &gt;These requirements extend to the private sector, with particular rules at play around the provision of goods and services and access by the public to places, vehicles and facilities — an exception to the latter being the risk of infecting others with an illness.  Source 3: &gt;An Israeli ""green passport"" showing the holder has been vaccinated against Covid-19. It allows holders to enter gyms, restaurants, hotels and concerts, while the unvaccinated cannot.

Now, presumably you must have read those articles, read the sections where they referenced internal access, and decided to post them anyway. So why would you claim the articles were only about travel passports?   Something something presenting information dishonestly to forward some sort of political agenda or something...

187,187,2,1634948562,"A LETTER TO OUR PRIME MINISTER...   Dear Jacinda,   I am a New Zealander...a mother and a grandmother.   The closest i have been to you was when we jigged side by side in the VIP area of a U2 concert a couple of years ago.  I remember thinking how tiny and pretty you were.   I am a sensitive empath, and watching the pain in your eyes as you comforted the bereaved and traumatised after the mosque massacre, and White Island...i thought i recognised the same in you.   I know your Misinformation Officer will quickly find this post and hopefully share it with you...   I am taking it upon myself to share a grassroots snapshot in time, of the immense suffering so many of your people are enduring right now.   I host a community of nearly 35,000 New Zealanders whose lives have been changed by the Covid 19 vaccine.   Many who gather here are living with the daily legacy of suffering serious adverse reactions to our ""safe and effective"" covid solution.   Some are paralysed or have lost their health and vitality as a result of a stroke, heart attack, blood clot or myocarditis after their jab.   Others are dealing with a paralysed face, or ongoing extreme exhaustion, crippling pain or daily headaches that see them confined to bed for weeks on end.  When they try to share their story (as many thousands tried to on your recent face book post), they are smashed with angry vitriol...cries of ""misinformation"" and ""antivaxer""...even though they were ""pro vax"" enough to roll up their sleeve for the needle.   Having unexpectedly created a safe place for these marginalised and injured to gather, gives me daily insight into a New Zealand story the likes of which most unwitting Kiwi's have no awareness of.  All they hear every day is ""safe and effective....and they trust you and believe it.   The personal interactions i have with these families will leave a permanent heavy record in my heart.    I often think of the family whose beautiful brilliant medical specialist daughter is left permanently crippled by her post jab stroke.    Or the 22 year old woman who had to learn to walk and talk again after her stroke, following the jab she didnt want to have, but gave in to, in order to keep her job.   The family just 3 weeks ago who are wracked with trauma and grief after their precious 14 year old son collapsed dead in their garden, 3 days after his jab.    I have literally hundreds of such stories to share with you....as do the many who tried, unsuccessfully, to do so on your recent face book post.   You wont see a single one of them on the 6 o'clock news, the 1 o'clock update or the front page of the Herald.    Of course i realise that the vast majority of Kiwis will have their jab and have nothing more than a sore arm...but for many others life is changed and these broken Kiwis (who did the right thing!!) deserve our compassionate acknowledgement and care, not our scorn and disbelief.   And now there is a new tsunami of grief and suffering growing....the thousands of New Zealanders who are now faced with a choice they believed would never be forced upon them.    Do they take a jab, that for a myriad of reasons they have chosen not to have....or do they lose their job, vocation, career of decades?   While some will find the fear of unemployment and financial destitution enough to drag them, kicking and screaming to the vaccine tent...   For others, no amount of pressure, coercion or personal cost will be enough to wrestle a consent from their arm.  I have received hundreds of messages from these soon to be unemployed experts.    We are set to loose literally thousands of years of vocational experience from the New Zealand work force.  Doctors, nurses, teachers, psychiatrists, midwives and more.  Yes even an Orthopedic Surgeon and a Forensic Psychiatrist will be walking.  Some who are new to their careers and still paying off student loans....others with 20 or 30 years of valuable experience.   To those who have already had their jab, this might seem pure insanity.  Why would a professional with everything to lose, not just simply call in to the vax centre at the end of a work shift, and be done with the turmoil, pressure and angst?   I'll share just a tiny few of the myriad reasons these incredible people have shared with me.   The reasons can be grouped, and the first group hinges on TRUST.   Try as they might, some just cannot rationalise their way into a place of trusting either Pfizer,  or you and our Government.   They struggle to believe that the largest corporate and pharmaceutical felons in history can just be ""trusted"" with a rapidly developed, novel technology, medical product with absolutely ZERO long term safety data.    They also struggle with knowing that the contract our Government signed with Pfizer is confidential, and includes (this much we know) 100% liability protection for Pfizer.    These injured Kiwi's I've spoken about...if they are lucky their financial care will come from ACC (its not a given though).  That's us.  The tax payers.  An ""all care, no responsibility"" contract with a pharmaceutical company with a track record like Pfizer, simply does not inspire confidence in those who do their due diligence.   Others of these smart and educated professionals (including many medics) have spent many hours reading the clinical trial papers, following the government adverse reaction (and efficacy) databases around the world.   They are deeply concerned by what they see. Unprecedented serious injury and death, the likes of which have never been witnessed with a vaccine before.  With the exception of the many times inflated risk of heart inflammation in young males, the other serious injuries (or worse) seem to be randomly meted out as a form of medical Russian Roulette.   There is another group of soon to be unemployed, who have health issues that in any ""ordinary"" times, would see them exempted or even contraindicated from receiving this vaccine.  Long histories of blood clots, heart attacks, neurodegeneration conditions, and yes even previous severe and life threatening allergic reactions.   Instead they find themselves mandated, terrorised and terrified....including those who nearly died from their first dose, and are simply told they MUST have their second dose in a hospital with a crash cart and a resuscitation team at hand.   Then comes the group, often also encompassing the first two groups, who will walk away from their career as a stand for medical freedom.    These people believe that capitulating against their will to take a medical intervention, with unprecedented evidence of damage from around the world, is the greater of two evils.   Those with intelligence have so many unanswered questions...   Why do they not have the option of presenting a negative saliva test twice a week to ensure they are safe in the work place? (firstly....why do we not have $20 saliva tests available like the rest of the world?)   Why is an ""immunity passport"" based on evidence of covid antibodies from previous infection, not enough to safely keep their job?   Why has our Government put no effort into providing us with an effective Early Treatment Outpatient program such as that used with overwhelming success by Dr Peter McCullough or Dr Zelenko?  Instead those in MIQ are offered panadol while they wait to see if their infection will lead them to ICU.   Why are we not checking the vitamin D status of every man woman and child in the land, and providing them with safe and effective doses of vitamin D...now that we know so clearly that low vitamin D makes us a sitting target for both infection and a poor outcome (and we have endemic vitamin D deficiency in NZ with our ""sun smart"" messaging).   Why have we not used the last 20 months to educate, empower and lead our nation into a better state of health....starting with sharing the brutal truth that obesity greatly increases your risk of ICU and death.   Why have you done everything in your power to block our access to Ivermectin when the evidence of both the safety and efficacy for prevention and treatment of Covid is overwhelmingly positive?  Why are we not having any national debate and discussion around the risk/benefit analysis of vaccinating our children? New Zealanders have simply not been informed that their children face virtually no risk of a poor outcome from covid (unless their child is already severely health compromised).  They are similarly unaware that their children face very real risks from taking the vaccine, including up to 25 times the usual risk of heart inflammation (young males), along with its potentially life shortening consequences.   Why do most New Zealanders not understand that as double vaccinated they can still both contract and transmit covid, get seriously ill from covid and die of covid.    We just have to look at the heavily vaccinated countries like Singapore, Israel and UK, to see that it will take much more than this ""leaky"" vaccine to put an end to our misery.   Why have New Zealanders not been told that the vaccine passport they covet, will likely disappear into thin air if they refuse to consent to a booster every six months in order to be considered ""fully vaccinated""...along with the repeated re exposure to serious health risks.   I think enough has been said.    Your people are hurting....the vaccine injured or bereaved; the mandated and disillusioned, frightened and no longer trusting; and all those who have chosen (for a myriad of rational reasons) to decline the jab, and are now vilified, attacked, belittled second rate citizens in their own country.   Right now our nation has never felt more divided.    Mental health has never felt more thread bare.  And never before have more questions been left unanswered.   Jacinda...

196,196,4,1634938782,"&gt;A month ago, when Grant Robertson first confirmed the Government was planning to use certificates, he said they'd aim to introduce them at the start of November.        Two weeks later, Dr Ashley Bloomfield had a different date in mind. The vaccine certificates, he said, should be ready in ""late November"".   &gt;   &gt;Yesterday, the timeline appeared to change again.        ""From mid-December, everyone in New Zealand should be able to access a digital vaccination certificate,"" said the official Covid-19 website.        After the discrepancy in dates was questioned, the wording on the Covid-19 website was promptly changed.   &gt;   &gt;""From later this year, everyone in New Zealand should be able to access a digital vaccination certificate,"" it said.        Then, late last night the website changed again, this time to ""the end of November"".        So is it mid-November, late-November, or mid-December that vaccine certificates in New Zealand will be downloadable and fully functional, where an individual's QR code can be scanned and cross-checked against a national database while protecting their private medical information?   &gt;   &gt;I might be accused of splitting hairs except for a couple of reasons.        If we take the latest of those different dates and vaccine certificates aren't fully functional until mid-December, there's a chance Auckland's DHBs will reach the golden 90 per cent vaccination threshold before the certificates are ready to go.        But fundamentally, if you think I shouldn't be quibbling over four or six weeks, you're right!        It's astonishing New Zealand doesn't have a fully functional vaccine passport system already developed and tested. Almost every developed country has a system in place. Israel launched its vaccine passport system in February. New York introduced vaccine passports in March. As National's Chris Bishop pointed out yesterday, Cuba has a vaccine passport system. Burkina Faso has a vaccine passport system!        But as recently as the start of August, in an interview with the Herald's Claire Trevett, Jacinda Ardern ruled out using vaccine passports in New Zealand. This was at a time when New South Wales was already recording hundreds of new infections a day.        Naivety or hubris? Why wouldn't New Zealand need vaccine passports when everyone else did? What makes us so special?        At the very least, the delay points to complacency. The development of a domestic vaccine passport system should have been a priority from the moment we placed our order with Pfizer, even if it later proved New Zealand never needed to use it.        That vaccine certificates aren't already functional tells us officials did not sufficiently prepare for a scenario in which New Zealand couldn't eliminate the virus.        We've been caught flat-footed with vaccine certificates because we thought we were different to everyone else. We thought we were better.

Our vaccine passport system should be ready by now. Yes they take time to develop, but there is no way that late November is acceptable. Our ability to reduce restrictions safely now also depends on how long this takes to be completed.  Expanding health capacity. While extremely difficult, the govt has done less than the bare minimum. Allowing healthcare workers residencies to expire, not prioritising new health worker visa's or MIQ spots. [This is damning.](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/126608859/miqueue-health-sector-mystified-over-struggle-to-get-staff-into-nz)  Our ICU ""surge capacity"" is dire. It's a joke - a last minute scramble to attempt to look like they've prepared. Nurses for this surge capacity have been given a total 8 hours training, half of it via an online module. Compared to around 230 hours of orientation training for normal ICU nurses.  Low Māori vaccination rates are an issue people have seen coming since the start.  The govt can't fix deep intergenerational mistrust in a racist institution, but it could do *something.* Maybe trusting Māori healthcare providers with funds just half as much as they trusted businesses with the $13 billion dollar wage subsidy? Rolling out innovative solutions for isolated communities early?

But there is a clearly established disconnect between policies implemented by ministers and what actually gets put in place by their ministries. The administrations inability to cut through ministry red tape and actually get shit done is an *abject failure.*  The plan isn't and shouldn't have been as simple as locking down until we vaccinate.

209,209,5,1634602673,"&gt; The number depends on how many people youre willing to let die.  If covid ever got as bad here as it has in the USA, which is impossible, we would be looking at about 10,000 deaths. Half would be over 75 and 80% of them would be over the age of 65. We have tanked our economy, we have restricted the rights of 5 million people, we are apparently going to carry on restricting the rights of half a million unpersons, the shameful ""antivaxxers"". All because we *maybe* could have had up to 10 thousand elderly people die. Again, that's if it were ever as bad here as in America, which is borderline impossible. Trust in government and trust amongst neighbours has been eroded, the seeds of division have been sown and taken root in our society. People are suspicious. People are angry with each other.

In normal circumstances, lets say the average person in a bar spreads it to 6 people. If they are vaccinated, they are less likely to have covid - so maybe the average person's bar visits only infect 3 people. Then if everyone else is vaccinated, *they* are less likely to get it - so the average person's bar visit only infects 1.5 people. Then if there are some social distancing rules, masks, etc, that reduces spread further - so the average person's bar visit only infects 0.75 people (below 1, yay!)  I'm simplifying the situation a lot, and the numbers I'm using are all made up, but it illustrates my point - no measure has to be 100% effective to be useful. If you take a lot of different small measures, they can add up to an effective response.

214,214,10,1634623978,"&gt;&gt; Yes, and we are proposing we reduce deaths by increasing vaccination rates, which can be done by offering incentives to get vaccinated. &gt;  &gt; That's already happening by many groups all around the country. What more do they need, free hand jobs?  We know more is needed because our vaccination rates aren't high enough. I don't know exactly what's needed but luckily the smart people in the government are (finally) looking into that.   &gt;&gt;This comment chain is people explicitly calling to do exactly what the government is planning to do, we just think it was a bad idea to wait until 63 days into lockdown to start thinking about those plans.  &gt;Ah yes so instead if should be they come up with a plan on day 1 when they have no idea how it's spreading, before they get international evidence on what works and what doesn't and before they can evaluate costs, resources etc. of any response required.  You actually don't require active COVID spread to have vaccines incentives. You can push vaccines while knowing nothing about spread, because the effectiveness of vaccines doesn't depend on an outbreak happening. For example, the government could have started developing the vaccine passport app several months ago, instead of waiting until now. Do you agree that it would be possible to develop a vaccine passport app not just on day 1 of the outbreak, but 100 days before the outbreak? None of the government's vaccine plans need to rely on an outbreak! The international evidence is already out there - it didn't all appear a week ago.   &gt;You will find out on Friday, like everyone else.  Yes, but it would be great if we found out several Fridays ago, because then more people would have been vaccinated in the mean time and the outbreak would be smaller.   We both agree its good that the government is pushing vaccines - but for some insane reason you think it's good to wait 66 days before doing so. That's 66 days in which spread is greater than it otherwise would have been.     &gt;&gt;Good to see your commitment to high quality discourse didn't end at spreading antivax propaganda.  &gt;By all means prove this strawman.  /u/Golgavar said: ""When though?

Firstly, if you already have a good stream of income, are self sufficient, and see growth in what your doing, the all power to you. Mind you usd$1000 per month is what, nzd$700 a fortnight? That's not enough to live off. It's easy to assume that by having more time allocated to working = being able to double/triple that, it's not always that easy. So basically, if you have a well thought out plan, are sure you can secure a good amount of income, and are able to be recognised for your work then that is a very good plan.

Your guaranteed to be recognised (although the sector is moving fast, make sure you dont get outdated). But that doesn't necessarily mean you study IT. A business course at poly, or a governance, policy, media course may give you the edge over pure building IT people. Basically, think of yourself as a 'builder' builder.

National's Airport vicinity proposal still has the risk of having people who live in and work in Auckland being employed there)  * I'm sure Northland's businesses will be happy to have the economic activity that comes from the employees of such a site when they're not at work  * in the absence of a pandemic, I'm sure such a site could be used for expanding refugee settlement or even as a hotel * try and create some kind of Asia Pacific Public Health Forum with economies like Queensland, Vietnam, Taiwan and so forth to advocate for pro-elimination policies... larger economies to be invited to join once an institutional bias towards being good neighbours is established  * we can headquarter this in the MIQ facility, say * just straight up giving permanent residences (subject to a security check, I suppose) to people in country during a border closure",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/q0u3o4/29_new_community_cases_28_in_auckland_1_in/hfaqfn1/

Everybody is being presented with a choice - take the vaccine or not?    Antivaxxers retain their bodily autonomy - they remain unvaccinated! - and will continue to be unvaccinated until they choose vaccination.    But their decision to remain unvaccinated for covid comes with consequences, same as anyone else.  Vaccination status is not a protected class like age, gender, sexual orientation, illness or disability. Denying unvaccinated people service or access to premises is no more discrimination than a ban from from bar, trespass, particularly if vaccination status requirements are the law of the land - we enforce age limits for age restricted content even where age is a protected class.     Any 'harm' antivaxxers feel is purely self-inflicted as a result of their inaction or decision and they can easily remedy it themselves.    I can't speak to Israel's vaccine passport implementation, but it seems to me if regular vaccinations are required to keep covid under control, the passports must also be able to support that reality.    If people want to stop taking boosters, that's their choice, but expect their vaccination passports to reflect that reality, eventually declare they are no longer effectively vaccinated and their options to become restricted.

254,254,0,1632882066,"But we’ll never a jump between 80 and 90%. If OP is correct that we’ll plateau at 80%, the effort that will take to halve the remaining number of unvaccinated will become increasingly difficult and therefore increasingly the wrong thing to do.   It seems that in every country around the world so far increasingly strict vaccine mandates result in increasing unrest. Whether or not you disagree with the unrest doesn’t change the fact that it is damaging to society. Be it protests, riots, or truckers blocking highways, society will be disrupted and it will cause harm. Never mind the fact that logic tells us those protesting against vaccine mandates are not going to work or have resigned/been fired from work because they are unvaccinated.   The amount of money, effort, and time that I believe other countries have spent to not only create and decided upon mandates, but to implement and enforce them, is probably so extraordinary as to be more than what it would have cost to seriously increase icu capacity and support the healthcare system in other ways. Let alone those healthcare workers themselves who volunteered to continue to work all through last year without a vaccine and back when we really had no idea how dangerous this virus was. Yet they still trooped on. If the vaccine rate of healthcare works to the normal population is roughly the same then that is not an insignificant number of works who would be fired or resign.   So the incredibly steep and expensive uphill battle to try and raise the vaccine rate clearly comes with a huge amount of issues, but another thing worth considering is that it also represents diminishing returns. A vaccine passport for overseas travel seems obvious, and should be implemented, but anything more than that domestically will prove itself an expensive waste of time.  In any case it doesn’t appear as though the government has put any effort into bolstering the health care system since our first outbreak, so it doesn’t seem as though they would do it now. And if we open up the borders then obviously (like the rest of the world) covid will be 100* endemic. Because that’s only a matter of time, covid is already practically endemic.

Thankfully we are at a stage where it seems to be plateauing and hospitals aren’t yet overrun. Almost every death is an unvaccinated person, go figure 🤔  Lots of employers and other entities are requiring vaccines like universities, airlines and so on. Even many jobs at requiring it. We have also been using a passport system for non-essential places like restaurants and gyms for two weeks, and prior to its implementation there was a new surge in vaccine appointments.   I think what you guys have against you is that Covid hasn’t hit you hard. You haven’t seen a lot of deaths, dealt with restrictions and have been living mostly normally through this time. Personally I think this may make NZ more hesitant at first, but of course people will just need to accept the inevitable and get vaxxed.   In a weird way even though we haven’t handled things as well over here I think dealing with all the shit of the past year really made people see the value in the vaccine.

267,267,6,1632872598,"tl;dr -- most of the problems I have with the list are explained away in the PDF.  ----  &gt;Supercharge the vaccine rollout;  How?  Key's ideas for doing this were (1) stupid and offensive and (2) weirdly obsessed with vouchers but they were mechanisms not aspirations.  Just mandate all vaccines... it's the best solution and you know it.  **What does a more detailed plan reveal?** Mechanisms, basically. They seem okay... good even (though I doubt they'll work... as they tacitly appear to acknowledge in saying mandates are required for healthcare workers: if their ideas are good enough why aren't they good enough for healthcare workers?).  &gt;Order vaccine boosters;  I'm inclined to agree that boosters are required. However, I also think that vaccinating people globally needs to be prioritised.  **What does a more detailed plan reveal?** Not much, frankly. You would hope that they at least address these concerns but they do not.  &gt;Upgrade our contact tracing capability;  This is also pointlessly aspirational but we've seen that they can do good mechanisms once already...  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** Vastly more than in the previous case. It looks like common sense things that should already have been done in, say, January this year.  &gt;Roll out saliva testing at the border and in the community  The only thing I can say straight up about this is something I'm not sure I actually read so I won't say it.  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** Basically, (1) saliva testing is just as effective, (2) it's far less invasive and, though this is only implicit, therefore (3) mandate daily testing for border workers, MIQ residents (on top of the current nasal tests) and hospital staff.  &gt;Roll out rapid tests for essential workers and in the community;  There are, again (see above), some ambiguities about what this means that might be readily resolved (is this daily, also?).  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** No it's intolerably, and unusually given the others, vague.   They seem to be suggesting a rapid test will just become a routine part of going to a GP or A&amp;E but that's not clear (it may even mean healthcare more generally). I'm pretty sure they're suggesting a rapid test on arrival in country but after that I'm a bit lost at what they want. They mention making rapid testing available to people to buy (how does this mesh with the contact tracing proposal? I don't know) and they suggest doing something for essential workers and customer facing, high volume roles (e.g. education workers, retail). What, however, that latter plan is I cannot say.  &gt;Create a dedicated agency, Te Korowai Kōkiri, to manage our Covid-19 response based in Manukau not Wellington;  I have often wondered if the larger part of the decision making around Covid settings in Auckland has been driven by people completely removed from life here in South Auckland, e.g. because they're in Wellington. However, I hate Wellington so #biased.  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** Basically, they say a Pandemic Response Agency is required... no argument from me... but they do not justify the location even though they're really specific about it. I should be clear that while Papakura's electoral borders are (a) huge and (b) enormously unstable [seriously, look at the maps, it's about as big as the rest of Auckland altogether], Manukau is not in Judith Collins' electorate so it's unlikely to be ""pork barrel"" politics. It's quite inexplicable though I do have a theory.  &gt;Build purpose-built quarantine;  Where? And why not state exactly where? Please don't be in Manukau...  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** Auckland Airport-ish. So... Manukau or Mangere (depending which direction you approach the Airport from, really).   I guess there's not too much difference between being a little isolated from Auckland as a whole and being a lot isolated from it. However, I would also say there isn't too much difference between being right in the middle of the CBD and drawing staff from all over Auckland, and being anywhere else in Auckland and drawing staff from all over Auckland. You have fewer avenues for a disease to escape quarantine but if it does (via staff), it's still loose and running in Auckland.  It's a tricky situation since you need to be somewhere that you can get people to and which already has some kind of proximity to a good location to have knowledge workers live. There is, I argue, a solution that mostly works. Connecting flights to Palmerston North. Not ideal, I admit, and a raw deal for Palmerston North if there is an outbreak... but it's got a university, which means there's a natural use for these units if there's no pandemic.  &gt;Launch a digital app for vaccination authentication;  I guess it's the best approach to a vaccine passport?  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** I guess that's their thinking also. Actually come to think of it... just create a vaccine ID number and use a registry.   &gt;Invest in next-generation Covid treatments  Again, with the needless aspirationism. I get that you can't necessarily embrace everything you want to do in a snappy phrase but why not ""Build and Operate a Contagious Disease Research Institute"", say?  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** Their problem is more or less to do with how Pharmac works. They could have just said that. It does appear that the standard operating model is too inflexible to deal with ""novel"" problems, but I prefer my idea (which isn't mutually exclusive, of course).  &gt;Prepare our hospitals and expand ICU capacity.  Unpopular opinion but I have generally found the ICU capacity arguments to lack the ""there's not enough capacity"" argument.   **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** I find the same problem here. However, the major purpose seems to be ""steal doctors and nurses from overseas"" but there's also stuff in there about ""let's not be dicks to the ones we've already acquired"" and ""let's make some more homegrown ones for the future"".  At this point, I return to the idea of Palmerston North. You see, there's a university there, as I said, so it just makes sense to me to try and make it a natural hub for all things contagious in country. If that requires another medical school, so be it. I imagine that would also have the effect of requiring building more ICU beds.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/pxg2jo/opening_up_national_announces_10_steps_to_prepare/henqkbc/

We are also accepting that the rights of our citizens to return to NZ, as guaranteed on their passports, has been curtailed on the order of a government department functionary.  Also using the state of emergency to rush unrelated laws through parliament without the proper processes. More limitations of free speech to come. Anti terrorism legislation to come, sounds rushed through parliament, not much support from other parties. They've taken everyone's automatic and semi-automatic firearms from them which would have been required to mount any reasonable uprising/revolution against an authoritarian government.  Covid is going to be around for a while now, with new variants creating problems. It definitely seems like the government and Ministry of Health have given up on proper elimination i.e. 0 cases in the community. They're not interested in investing in proper quarantine facilities, they like to use leaky hotels so outbreaks keep happening, in our largest city even. They seem almost entirely clueless about efficacy of certain masks i.e. bandana 0%, cloth 0-30%, surgical 11%, double masking 60-90%, N95 respirator 95%, N99 respirator 99% etc. If they really wanted to eliminate community transmission they would mandate double masking or N95+ in public places to stop onward spread and stop more people being infected.  So since elimination is now impossible (because they let it in repeatedly and we're doing a half-arsed job of controlling it) I'm thinking they'll say we'll now be required to live with the emergency settings indefinitely, i.e. no level 1, permanent level 2+/3/4, scanning in everywhere you go, paying electronically (fully trackable), having Bluetooth tracing on so they know who you're in contact with, refusal to pass a law that will stop the tracing data being used by Police, SIS, GCSB etc, papers and negative testing to cross the border or leave Auckland.  Now they're talking about vaccine passports for local community use (not even international travel). I have a vaccination booklet with Yellow Fever in it which was required for a long time for international travel in some countries. Never have I heard before about a vaccine required to dine in a restaurant or visit the cinema etc. I am fully vaccinated but I know for a fact that the vaccine doesn't provide sterilising immunity. One vaccinated person with a breakthrough infection can go to the cinema, restaurant etc and spread it around via the air conditioning and give delta to many people there seeing that the vaccine is only 40% effective against getting infected. The viral load is the same so they'll then pass it on and so on. Having them vaccinated dampens the spread a little, but not a lot. The local vaccine passport requirements is almost useless in that regard. Better to have a rapid spit test before entry. This is another thing the government has no interest in doing, because they prefer the police state policies of scanning in and showing papers.  At the end of the day, once the freedoms are gone it will be almost impossible to get them back.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/pug772/is_anyone_else_getting_really_sick_of_the/he4wej6/

276,276,3,1632528304,"Is it even based in science?  - Current vaccines only provide ""good"" protection against hospitalisation and death (not perfect). We actually need more tailored vaccines against delta and newer variants. The vaccines were developed for the original wild virus.  - A double vaccinated person has a ~61% chance of a breakthrough infection (vaccine is 39% effective against delta).  - A vaccinated person with breakthrough Covid can still spread the virus just like an unvaccinated and they have similar viral load. The vaccines don't prevent transmission here.  - Herd immunity with level 1 measures alone and relying on vaccines is looking almost impossible.  Basic numbers, even with some kind of vaccine passport for cinemas/indoor restaurants/nightclubs and 100 people in the cinema/restaurant/nightclub:  - Nobody is masked because the government tells them it's ""safe"" because everyone is vaccinated.  - A vaccinated person with a breakthrough infection enters and is breathing out virus into the same shared air environment over a period of 1-3 hours.  - You could expect 61 vaccinated people will get an infection, a bunch might be asymptomatic but some will have symptoms, 5 might get severe illness and need hospitalisation, then maybe a few die depending on healthcare availablity.  Seems pretty clear that going to an indoor environment with no mask/respirator protection or good ventilation even with a bunch of vaccinated people is not a good idea regardless.

From the measures implemented here, and the discussions I've had with people, I think covid-passport enforced admittance to bars is the most effective measure they've done so far. For anything other than vaccines, this kind of restriction would be too totalitarian, but vaccines are there to protect society as much as the individual.   Given the number of people who can't get vaccinated, antivaxers make it hard to achieve effective heard immunity for covid. But from my experience (I've run into a few and had conversations, and have 2nd hand accounts of some), most antivaxers are sceptics, not crazies, and the social pressure from vaccine (or tests) to enter bars seems to swing most of them towards getting jabbed. Having something so obvious that has real effects on their life and widespread acceptance seems to enough to quash their doubt.  And even with a lot of bars not checking it at the door, when you go to events here the organisers will often check separately (eg: meetups), and just having people offering to show them when there's no checks seems to be enough.  For the record, we can sit outside at bars/cafes/whatever with no restrictions (still with contact tracing), but if we want to go inside we have to be vaccinated. And as winter is coming, it's putting pressure on people wanting to sit inside to get out of the weather.

When going to restaurants, bars and checking into accommodation they just point their phone at your phone’s display and that’s it - only takes a second.  I think in France you can also go into venues if you’re not vaccinated but have a recent (within last x days) negative PCR test.  France is easy to enter - just needed to prove I was double vaccinated at customs.

This is not relevant because proof of vaccination is a binary thing. Have you been vaccinated or not. Yes, Covid vaccines do not provide sterile immunity so yes you can catch it and pass it on(much much less than an unvaccinated person) but all of them are still providing excellent protection against serious illness and hospitalization. Still, that is not relevant to what rights we have under existing laws to have a covid passport. 2. It doesn't need to. Again, have you been vaccinated or not. If we do move to a booster shot regime or a yearly vaccine like the flu jab it could be tied to your app and alert you that you are due for a booster like your wof. Not relevant to our rights. 3. You mention breakthrough cases few times but I'm not sure why. Breakthrough cases will not be what overwhelm the healthcare system but will be the unvaccinated just like we are seeing everywhere else. Why are we discussing the 1% and not discussing the 99%? Still not relevant to our rights. 4. Look, if New Zealand wanted to be totalitarian they would make the vaccine mandatory but that's not going to happen. It will be a bitter irony if we open up and then have to go back to restrictions because the unvaccinated overwhelming the healthcare system and causing an unnecessary large death toll. It will be ironic because a large majority of the people who were against lockdowns or the elimination strategy that has seen us so well off this last year and a half will also be among those that refused to get vaccinated and trigger those restrictions once again. 5.

It is not too soon to tell and is exactly what is happening wherever cases are spiking again. Again, here is maybe evidence of why you speak so much about breakthrough cases but this is completely opposite to the current reality. Healthcare systems and ICU's are being overun by those who are unvaccinated and specificallt not breakthrough cases.

Israel has just reported that after 6 months even the Pfizer vaccine is only 39% effective at preventing symptomatic infection with Delta and the US CDC has reported those fully vaccinated with Delta carry the same viral load and are just as contagious as unvaccinated and now mask mandates are being restored for the vaccinated too.    A July 4th celebration in Provincetown has now resulted in nearly 900 cases of Covid, of which 74% were fully vaccinated.  And Pfizer and Israel have said a 3rd booster will be needed at 6 months.    That means a vaccine passport will likely soon be irrelevant.  Vaccinated people will be just as risky as the unvaccinated for spreading the virus here.  It will still give them better protection against severe illness an death, but it won't protect the community.

Its far more nuanced than that eg a robust/recognized global vaccine passport is likely a couple of years away,  there are a lot of countries that wont have vaccinated their populations,  a lot of airlines/tourism operators/routes etc are simply gone, things that were 'feasible' before wont be anymore in the post-covid world due to numbers, all kinds of insurances including personal (travel/health) and corporate (event, health &amp; safety etc) have changed which is huge, health and safety considerations themselves have changed, appetites for and perceptions around risk have changed.

Now it has come to light that 97% of people admitted to the ICU with COVID are simply vitamin D deficient. Gates proposed to block out the sun with atmospheric aerosols to combat global warming. Gates father was a renowned Eugenicist, a signatory to the Eugenic society. Klaus Schwab, Gates, the Rockefellers, Kissinger and other .01% economic ""elite"" meet every year in Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum. You know what the problem is? Human overpopulation. What better way to get in front of both the global economic collapse that was to occur in 2020 due to fiscal stimulus / money printing and a collapsing dollar and the human population bottleneck than with a fake pandemic.  Exactly zero of the information here is infactual. You have been thoroughly, completely bamboozled.  The crux of the matter is that this entire ""pandemic"" is based on the PCR test at 50 amplification cycles, and scientists, epidemiologists the world over were calling this out very early on. Anything above 25-30 cycles results in a huge false positive rate (97% @ 50 cycles!). The day of Biden's inauguration (I voted for Jill Stein last time around, Corporate Left = Corporate Right, I don't like Trump nor Biden, but they managed to politicize it so that if you call out the Fake Pandemic youre a ""Trump supporter"") the WHO announced that 50 cycles was too high and, and I'm not kidding here, ""all of the tests from 2020 need to be ""redone"". Yes that's correct. The justification for the lockdowns, the ""pandemic"" was all based on PCR test at 50 amplification cycles and now the day of Biden's inauguration the WHO comes out and announces that the tests need to be redone. Can you fucking undo the lockdowns? Does anyone know that more people committed suicide in Japan in the month of November 2020 than died from COVID 19 for the entire year, direct consequence of the lockdowns? Do you understand that childhood suicide is on the rise? Youre going to tell kids to stay at home and their only form of interaction with other children and the world at large is through a fucking ipad? We are DESTROYING these children for something with a 99.97% rate of survival! In fact under 50 the IFR for seasonal flu is higher than SARS-CoV-2! 6 feet? Why not 7 or 8? It's an arbitrary figure that has no backing from ANY science! You can enter a restaurant ""you must wear your mask to enter"" and then when you sit down you take the fucking mask off and no-one questions the logic or rationale for the masks? Bacterial pneumonia is on the rise because not only do these fabric masks not keep out 7nm virus but paper is a medium for bacterial growth. Sweden never did the lockdown, the social distancing nor the mask mandate, want to guess how many people died in Oct 2020 from COVID out of a population of 10 million? 55. Texas lifts the lockdown and cases plummet (sunlight, vitamin D and exercise best medicine against influenza virus family). ""Stay at home out of sunlight with your mask on"" they are driving sickness with these policies, on top of the emotional distress and negative social interaction. ""Deaths are up year over year"". Mortality from all causes goes up big time during economic recession.   There is ZERO science supporting the masks, social distancing, nor the lockdowns and these aren't vaccines. They have an agenda. Again, global economy was going to collapse and we do have a human overpopulation problem (not simply overpopulation, more so overconsumption, with China and India poised to attain the level of consumption of a 1st worlder, the planet cannot support this, at present, with only the Anglosphere consuming the energy equivalent of 23 Bangladeshi's, not to mention water (1 pint of Almond Milk = 1600 gallons of embodied water) we need 5 planet Earth's of resources to sustain this level of consumption. The 1 billion that they will keep around after the ""Great Pandemic"" via mRNA vaccines will only be because biological robots are a higher level of robot that can go into the Tesla Truck factory and change a fuse now and then. The 1 billion remaining will be chipped and heavily monitored via 5G + implant interface. If they need to reduce a certain demographic, say there are too many Hispanic people, they will custom taylor the ""top up"" annual vaccines (Pfizer has already announced that a 3rd shot is necessary and that you will need a new one every year, ""kaching kaching"" cash register sound) to delete a number of ""excess"" certain ethnicity or sex or age or whatever.   Here's how they will depopulate, what we see with these mRNA vaccines is a phenomenon called ADE (Antibody Dependent Enhancement) / Pathogenic Priming. A study done on ferrets and then reproduced on non-human primates showed 100% rate of mortality when specimens were given these biologics / gene therapy (they aren't vaccines, they are calling them that so they can remain indemnified under 1986 Childhood Vaccine Injury Act) they all died when exposed to the actual wild variant of the virus later on. Given the difference in body mass and metabolism, as Dr. Schmidt points out, this may take more than one flu season, or maybe not.  Here's my prediction, vulnerable people who blindly rolled up their sleeves for these ""vaccines"" will be dying this or the next upcoming flu season en masse, they will call it ""The Dark Winter"" and Big Pharma owned media and politicians (Cuomo, Newsom) will spin it and claim that the reason why we are having a Dark Winter is because we didn't attain ""herd immunity"" because of vaccine hesitancy. At that point in time they will introduce legislation mandating compulsory vaccination for all adults because of the ""emergency"". They will not come to your doorstep. They will ensure compliance by way of a vaccine passport, at first app based, but then they will introduce implantable RFID chips (more advanced, can communicate with body endocrinology, via 5G, which no-one wants, nor needs (5G is 2.4 GHz millimeter wave EMF, the same freq as U.S. Army active denial system, same tech the Russians were working on in the 1980's, ""psychotronic"" weaponry. 5G @ 100m distance is EMF equivalent of holding a phone directly to your head but about your entire body, 24/7, and they want to put a 5G antenna on every street corner, literally. FCC has been captured by the telecoms just as the FDA and CDC have been captured by Big Pharma and you cannot refuse the installation of this technology, nor are any health and safety studies required).

One of the biggest reasons why rents are so high in cities such as Wellington is due to students and property investors literally gear their mortgage repayments and rent to match the student benefit, and when kiwis leave you can be damn sure the government will open the doors to foreign property investors (who can literally buy a Singaporean passport and they’re exempt from the ban) and foreign students to replace the rent paying-property owning kiwis that they have lost.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/m24sqz/new_zealands_property_prices_are_so_cooked_kiwis/gqik6p5/

356,356,0,1614020248,"&gt; Close to 1000 people, mostly Cook Islanders, have left the country since the one-way travel bubble opened, sparking fears of another exodus of labour overseas.  &gt; Close to 1000 people have left the Cook Islands since the first flight departed Rarotonga on January 20, as part of New Zealand and the Cook Islands one-way travel bubble.  &gt; In return, only 290 people have taken up the offer to fly to the Cook Islands.  &gt; An average flight to New Zealand has carried 103 passengers compared with an average of only 48 people flying into Rarotonga. This is taking into account the three flights that arrived here without passengers, in light of Covid-19 community cases in New Zealand. If these people do not return, the Cook Islands will be roughly four per cent smaller than before the bubble opened.  &gt; According to Cook Islands Chamber of Commerce president, Fletcher Melvin, people leaving the country for better opportunities is an ongoing issue. “It’s always been the case. People leaving the country and not coming back.”  &gt; From 1996 to 2016 the Cook Islands saw over 19,000 residents leaving the country, a number more than the current population size.  &gt; But government statistician Taggy Tangimetua says taking the accumulated excess of -19,946 from 1996 to 2016 to mean that 19,000 left the country “is misleading”.  &gt; “You have to take the population into consideration. So, say if you take the 2016 year net of -1171 and given the resident population (mid-year) is 15000, the rate of migration would be 78, meaning for every 1000 people in this country at the beginning of the 2016, 78 will have moved out by the end of the year. Don’t forget you are counting the movement of people crossing the border (a person could have travelled multiple times during the period).”  &gt; In the past decade, Cook Islands population had to be bolstered by people from overseas taking up jobs here, mostly in the tourism sector. It’s only been in the past five years that more Cook Islands residents have chosen to settle at home than leave.  &gt; Fletcher Melvin, like many others, does not want to slip back into losing the population overseas. And he is fearing the worst if a two-way travel bubble cannot be established.  &gt; “Without the money injected from tourism, people will be forced to look for work outside of the Cook Islands. “It’s all about just how long businesses will last.” Despite Cook Islanders leaving to work in fruit picking or freezing works temporarily, Melvin says many permanent Cook Islanders living in New Zealand would have left with that same thought in mind.  &gt; He says temporary jobs often turn into permanent jobs and people decide to stay put.  &gt; Melvin is concerned if more people leave, the country will suffer from a labour shortage.  &gt; Liana Scott, the president of Cook Islands Tourism Industry Council, says the exodus is a major concern. Scott, who is also the general manager of Muri Beach Club Hotel, says those leaving are young able-bodied people, who play important roles as labourers, or as fill-in staff for the tourism industry.  &gt; “If there is no definite open date, and families are struggling to pay off debt or survive, then they have no choice but to seek other opportunities.”  &gt; She says there are plenty of work opportunities with attractive incentives.  &gt; Scott says orchards and freezing works are screaming for help, with accommodation and meals often provided as part of the deal.  &gt; “Our worry is that these young people do not return after their placement.”  &gt; She says businesses downsizing from depopulation or staff being stretched in working roles is also a very real possibility.  &gt; Scott is also concerned that once the travel bubble opens, accommodation providers will not be able to keep up with demand because they won’t be able to find staff to fill needed positions.  &gt; Restrictions placed on non-New Zealand passport holders also make it difficult to fill positions, she adds. Adding to the labour shortages associated with depopulation, Fletcher Melvin says Cook Islanders “don’t have a big remittance culture”.   &gt; This means it’s unlikely the country will be injected with cash from those working in orchard or freezing works.  &gt; Melvin says remittance culture is much bigger in other Pacific nations but for Cook Islanders, “it’s just as easy for family members to live in New Zealand as for money to be sent back home”.  &gt; Leader of the Opposition, Tina Pupuke Browne says while she understands why young people are going to New Zealand to work, she hopes they will return to the Cook Islands after completing their contract.  &gt; “The worry of course is that our young people will leave in droves, already a good number have left with more intending to leave and we repeat the sad experience of 1996. We lost 6,000 of our people and our population has never recovered.”  &gt; Browne says there’s a lot of talk about being creative, utilising technology and diversifying away from tourism and she believes government agencies like the Business Trade and Investment Board should be doing more to push for better technology.  &gt; “What happened to the ‘…superhighway for Cook Islands to world’s largest internet hub.’  &gt; “I know of young people who are trying to forge ahead in their respective businesses and are heavy users of the internet, but prices are still amongst the highest in the Pacific region.”",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/lpwght/close_to_1000_people_have_left_the_cook_islands/godcidc/

358,0,0,1643152742,"The global impact on the supply chain because of the pandemic has led to shortages of essential medicines in New Zealand, forcing pharmacies to ration them, as staff struggle with burnout.  About 24 medications, used to remedy illnesses such as inflammatory bowel disease, pain (analgesics), cardiac blood pressure, hormone replacement, smoking cessation and even certain antibiotics used by children, are running low.  Pharmac director of operations Lisa Williams said Covid-19 was having a global impact on manufacturing plants, workforce disruptions, logistics and supply chains.  ""Our contracts require companies to hold around three months' supply of their medicines in New Zealand and they place the onus on suppliers to source alternatives,"" Williams said.  ""Where suppliers go below or think there is the potential that they will go below the minimum level of stock, they are required to contact us with their management plan for the continuity of supply.""  In most cases, alternative medicines have been sourced, she said.  Pharmac, a Government agency that decides which medicines and related products are funded, pays for nearly 1000 medicines, she said.   Otago University professor and the president of the Pharmaceutical Society Rhiannon Braund said although alternatives for most medications running low were there, using another medicine was not always easy.  Prescription medicines were difficult to change because they not only require a new visit to the doctor, but also re-adjusting the doses and managing any possible side effects and reactions it may have on the patient, said Braund, who is also a member of Pharmac's pharmacology and therapeutics advisory committee.  New Zealand's independent pharmacists' association vice president Sarah Mooney said for the most part Pharmac decided how frequently pharmacies could dispense something, whether a repeat prescription or giving it all at once.  Usually, ""if we give a restricted supply due to shortages this is dictated to us by Pharmac"".  Since the first lockdown, pharmacists have been told to restrict paracetemol.  Chemists used to give it out up to the maximum quantity allowed on the script unless the doctor specified otherwise.  ""During the first lockdown, there were supply issues so we were told to give out no more than 100 per dispensing and no more than 300 per prescription - 100 with 2 repeats - unless the patient is on it regularly.  ""This is actually a lot of paracetamol and I don't believe restricting it to this quantity is actually a bad thing as it is New Zealand's most common poison; however as with most things, it is not our call. We just do what Pharmac or the doctor tell us to do,"" Mooney said. Which medicine is short changes all the time, she said.  ""It would really help if the public would 'shop normally' for their medicines.  ""During the first lockdown we ran low on a lot of regular medicines and Pharmac made us start dispensing it all monthly, but the only reason we were starting to run low was because people were stockpiling,"" Mooney said.  Recently pharmacies have been running low on blood pressure Quinapril and Locoid Lipocream, a common steroid cream for skin problems and they ran out of cefaclor suspension, a children's antibiotic.  ""It certainly consumes a lot of extra time trying to keep on top of what's available and arrange new prescriptions from doctors for alternative medicines when what they want isn't available,"" she said.  Shortages in workforce Upper Hutt Queen St pharmacy owner Brooke McKay said workload had increased in a huge way especially by having to do vaccinations and rapid antigen testing (RAT) and they ""definitely"" needed some extra helping hands.  But the process for the pharmacists to return back to work if they had taken some time off was an expensive and long process.  She said most pharmacists had been working 12 hours a day, seven days a week. She even had to return early from maternity leave and many were changing holiday plans.  ""Most pharmacists are doing well over 40 hours a week with owner pharmacists doing up to 60 hours a week and that's ongoing since the first lockdown. ""Most of us cancelled holiday breaks."" she said.  To mitigate the shortages of pharmacists in the country there should be an easier process for the recent retirees and locums to come on board.  Even qualified and experienced retired pharmacists have to pay about $1000 to re-register and do some form of training to be able to start working if they have been out of a job for more than three years.  ""We have stepped up and we have never shut our doors to our customers and we should be proud of our work. We will continue to serve our community throughout the pandemic,"" McKay said.  Mooney said: ""Pharmacists workloads have been increasing for a long time, but the pandemic has been the nail in the coffin for many of us and anecdotally there are a lot of pharmacists burned out from the pressure. ""We are anxious about picking up Covid-19 and taking it back to our families.  ""We are worn out from the extra workload - RATs and vaccine certificates just started seemingly out of the blue - at the busiest time of year and there wasn't time to organise extra staff so the existing staff just sucked up the extra work,"" she said.  Pharmacy council chief executive Michael Pead said the fee for an annual practising certificate (APC) is about $920 and has to be renewed every year in March in time for the practising year that runs from April 1 to March 31.  ""Council has arranged short-dated practising certificates to help former practising pharmacists - less than three years out of practice - return, to help workforce pressures. These processes are in place if and when required,"" he said.  ""We do not charge for short-dated certificates, in 'emergency' situations. Council applied this approach when in lockdowns and will likely do so under traffic light red and or as necessary in response to workforce pressures.  ""The period of the short dating will depend on the practitioners and the length of employment required - in the case of lockdowns, three months has been typical.""  Braund said the Covid-19 pandemic was not considered an emergency, unlike the aftermath of the Christchurch earthquake.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/scqjhv/essential_medications_rationed_due_to_supply/hu7xnqq/

That means a person can easily change the name, birth date or expiry date of the pass that appears on their phone's screen, or that they print out. &gt;  &gt; The Ministry of Health said that was not a major issue, because those confirming a person's vaccination status would scan the QR code on the pass, which could not be edited. The NZ Pass Verifier app would also automatically reject a pass with an expired date (as recorded by its QR code), whatever is written on the document. &gt;  &gt; That's all well and good if a business has someone on the door actively scanning the passes. &gt;  &gt; But if they ease things along by just sighting a pass, then being able to edit it will become an issue. &gt;  &gt; Ardern said yesterday: ""The Verifier App - as we've said all along, handy tool, but it is not a requirement to operate. You can sight someone's vaccine pass. And if you have any concerns, you can ask for verifying ID, if you like."" &gt;  &gt; But it's not like, say, the age requirement for buying alcohol, where youthful appearance will trigger a bouncer to ask for ID. &gt;  &gt; There's no such obvious ""tell"" that a person has edited the expiry date on their pass - or, if don't know their way around Adobe Acrobat - that they have simply borrowed someone else's. &gt;  &gt; A photo ID on the vaccine pass is the obvious solution, but probably not one was tenable for a pass programme where one of the contracts wasn't signed until October 13. &gt;  &gt; Starting much earlier during the 16-month gap we had between the first lockdowns and Delta could probably have meant that was a goer (earlier, the MoH said it wanted to hang fire to see what vaccine certificate initiatives were developed overseas. &gt;  &gt; Ardern said such casual checks were ""no different from what most countries around the world are doing.

483,125,4,1636941098,"&gt;The antivax one from Plimmerton shoe sent an email to all his patients telling them not to get vaccinated? He deserves to be struck off in my opinion.  I agree with you in this guy. That's just dumb. But I've seen from many sources - most of them anecdotal, that they've been told to encourage vaccinations for all patients and discouraged from discussing side effects with patients. I'm inclined to listen to the doctors saying that this is what they're being told.   &gt;There has been no weekly testing of unvaccinated teachers. Where did you get this information from?  [here we go](https://www.ppta.org.nz/advice-and-issues/covid-19-information-for-unvaccinated-members/)  ""Effect of PHOT   Teachers in level 3 areas   You cannot return to onsite duties without evidence of a negative COVID test in the previous five days.

Those who are not fully vaccinated leading up to January will have to undergo weekly Covid tests.""   So yes, we do have weekly testing of unvaccinated teachers - in level 3 areas.   &gt;As for Edmonton, if there were no staff or residents were vaccinated the numbers would be much worse than they are. Respectfully, I think you do not fully understand risk and relative risk.  Right, now apply this to a covid positive fully vaccinated teacher in a classroom with 28 unvaccinated 9 year olds.(My child's class size so that's what I'm basing that one on) I don't deny that Edmonton could have been worse, a whole hell of a lot worse. You want to take that risk with our children? Children who are too young to be vaccinated, children who can carry that home to babies and elderly grandparents? The risk of having untested teachers just because they have a bright and shiny vaccine certificate is too great.   &gt;Your suggestion about making sure hospitals can cope is not a strategy that works in a pandemic. It takes 3 years to train a nurse, double and more for a doctor. The virus isn’t going to wait for that.  It depends on your definition of making sure hospitals can cope...   For me - it's not freezing the pay of our hospital staff in the middle of a pandemic. It's not keeping workers on temp visas and having them leave because we couldn't give them a permanent position and residence in this country so they left. It's making sure that nurses, doctors aids etc are paid appropriately so they can actually make a living instead of going overseas where they can make more money. Uts not sitting with your finger up your ass until the 13th of October 2021 before getting your department to start looking in to ways of getting health workers in to the country because they're not getting MIQ spots... we had over 1000 health workers ready and waiting to come here, to help us before the 2020 lockdown... they should have been let in and given priority. And it sure as hell is NOT firing a bunch of nurses and other health workers who last year put their health, their lives on the line to help us all out, make sure everyone got the care they needed just because they're uncomfortable with the Pfizer jab. Astrazeneca, J&amp;J, Jansen were approved AGES ago. Giving people the choice would have had a better uptake without having to force people. All the mandate has done is ensure our hospitals are even more understaffed, that nurses are under even more pressure and some of those will quit simply because they're burnt out/copping abuse from patients/ need something different.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/qtgdu9/covid19_delta_outbreak_act_leader_david_seymour/hko0yc9/

Simply my child's class size, I don't know if 28 children to 1 teacher is the norm, on the lower end or the higher end so using his classroom size as an example of how the risk I see.   &gt;I am advocating for all teachers to be vaccinated to reduce the risk of kids, who cannot currently get vaccinated, getting Covid. A Covid positive vaccinated teacher is much less likely to infect students regardless of their testing status than an unvaccinated one.  I completely disagree. If we use the Edmonton example again, the number of residents that were double vaccinated that were infected by a double vaccinated staff member is significant. If we put unvaccinated students in to a classroom with a double vaccinated covid positive teacher every single one of those children is at risk and will likely catch the virus.   I care more for the teacher actually being negative for covid than I do for them being vaccinated - in my view, if you can catch and pass it on while fully vaccinated (however less likely it is) I'd rather see a negative test than a vaccine certificate. Because regardless of your certificate, you can pass covid to my child if you have covid.   &gt;When vaccines are available for under 12 year olds becomes available will you have your children vaccinated?  Depends, I only have 1 in the 5-11 category, 3 much younger. And it will depend on what my sons GP and Pediatricic specialist advise us is best for him.

530,172,2,1635975195,"2: 26 do not have sufficient information for a conclusion.   When people die there are two main pathways for how things proceed. If the death is unexpected for any reason, or suspicious in any way then the death is referred to the coroner. The police act on their behalf, gather information pertaining to the death and the coroner collates this information and reports on it. In the cases where the death is particularly notable or there are lessons to be learned (or mistakes made) which contributed to it this is where coroners inquiries or court comes into play.   For some people their deaths are expected. They could be old or have terminal conditions or just comorbidities which mean that if they die from certain events it is not a surprise.  In these cases their GP can sign their death certificate and the deceased goes straight to the funeral home for whatever practices their families culture or religion embraces from there.  Deaths in this second group are less likely to have extensive examinations conducted and therefore their reports could lack sufficient information from which any form or confident analysis could be made. The timeline between getting vaccinated and passing from an expected condition is variable and understandably many of these vulnerable patients choose to be vaccinated probably assuming that COVID would be extremely likely to kill them if they got it.   3a: Of the 6.5 million doses, 70% of those are second dose.  3b: Natural death rates were not applied to the scenario of 50,000 people.   I’m not sure about the first point (3a) with regards to 70% being second dose. To get second you must have had first. I would think that would create a lower limit of 50% for first dosing assuming everyone also followed it up with a second. I’m a math moron so very happy to have this one pulled apart.   When I did my initial sums I treated every vaccine administration as a potential harm event. Anaphylaxis for example usually comes from a strong reaction to first exposure then a potentially lethal overreaction to subsequent exposures. This is because the immune system is improperly primed to respond to the stimuli after the first experience. No response to first dose lowers the risk of an anaphylactic response to the second but I wanted to ensure the possibility was captured in the calculation.  I agree that there is probably better modelling that could be applied here when considering the risk of first vs second dose administration, though I think it would likely favour safety versus more adverse events.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/qdq7az/im_trying_to_convince_my_friend_to_get_vaccinated/hj7bkum/

You consent to it and you've given informed consent. Also, under our employment laws, if you are found to have a positive test, the company has an obligation to help you get clean- rehab/counseling etc and readminiter a test in a certain time frame. If those actions fail or you decline, only then can you be terminated. And being impaired on the job is a massive risk to your immediate safety and the immediate safety of others. (Not saying covid isn't, this is just part of my understanding, I'm still going)   A lot of people I know, are feeling like with this vaccine, they're not informed enough for them to feel comfortable giving consent. Consent obtained by pressure, coersion, force or threat is *not* consent. And we actually have legal frame work for that (albeit in sexual assault cases, the same arguments can be made here)   There's also the waning efficacy argument and the fact that vaccinated people can still spread the virus - yes, I know its at a lower rate and that it mostly prevents people from serious illness etc, that's ab argument for another time - so just being vaccinated isn't going to be enough at some point. The vast majority of people who I know that don't want the vaccine would rather have an alternative such as rapid testing. It gives them, the employer and the customer base a lot more confidence than a vaccine certificate could because if the test is accurate enough, they're proven to be ""clean"" without having to undergo a medical procedure they don't want and don't feel capable of giving informed consent for.  And if the test comes back positive before the work day starts, they go home. Sick leave/ annual leave/ unpaid leave until they can produce a negative test.   The $120 million that's been spent trying to convince those who are adamant they don't want it could have been spent partly subsidizing rapid tests like the ones being used at middlemore hospital. If they don't want the vaccine which is free the alternative is that they can purchase their own tests (possibly partly subsidized as this would likely come under a health directive)   I honestly am concerned that the Vax certificate is flawed in that people may overlook mild symptoms because they're double jabbed and that increases the risk of the virus spreading. Those who are unvaccinated but willing to take a test every day, willing to purchase their tests don't deserve to be treated as second class citizens. They want to be a part of the community, want to work, to do the right thing but are uncomfortable with a forced medical procedure. I cant blame them for that.

574,216,4,1635465015,"&gt; You might believe the fiction that politicians are in charge but — to cite the Harold Macmillan cliché — the greatest influence on policy is events.  &gt;On that basis, ignore the details of what the Government says on any given day and plan for the new normal to arrive in weeks rather than months. You should be able to safely book your summer holiday, whether camping in Northland or skiing in St Moritz.  &gt;And while the weeks ahead will be tough — especially if you work at Middlemore Hospital — retailers can look forward to an excellent Christmas shopping season, and all other businesspeople to a 2022 undisturbed by lockdowns or other material restrictions.  &gt;Since Jacinda Ardern abandoned elimination on October 4 by announcing Auckland's move to level 3 the next day, a remorseless logic has been driving her decisions.  &gt;To her credit, Ardern is boldly going with the flow: abandoning her levels and steps in favour of the new traffic lights; introducing domestic vaccine passports; expanding compulsory vaccination to at least 40 per cent and perhaps the whole workforce; expanding the types of vaccines New Zealand recognises; planning to open all schools in two weeks; fast-tracking the approval and purchase of Pfizer's paediatric and booster vaccines plus Merck's new antiviral pill; moving yesterday towards abolishing managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ); and on track to abandon her own vaccination targets and internal borders by Christmas if that doesn't happen automatically under current policy.  &gt;The Prime Minister has no real choice. The conceit that we alone would beat Delta was just another manifestation of our naive national myth of Kiwi exceptionalism. Our Covid journey will ultimately follow roughly the same path as everywhere else.  &gt;Ardern was right to pursue elimination for as long as she did. It delivered fewer hospital admissions and deaths, and some near-normal times between the two big lockdowns while we waited for the vaccine.  &gt;**But when the new normal arrives, a million or so of us will get Covid each year, and everyone before too long. The only choice is whether you are vaccinated or unvaccinated, which in turn strongly influences whether you spend a few days in bed or less, or end up in hospital or worse.**  &gt;Whether she admits it or not, Ardern's failure to order vaccines in line with the rest of the developed world, and her decision to move to level 3 before near-universal vaccination, ensured hospital wards and MIQ facilities would be overwhelmed.  &gt;So it has transpired, with over 300 people with Covid already unable to be accommodated and living at home, hopefully with some medical care or at least a pulse oximeter. Soon it will be many more.  &gt;The forced shift to home-based care in turn made yesterday's MIQ decision unavoidable. It was impossible to justify sending home hundreds of non-vaccinated sick people, while forcing double-vaccinated Kiwis who had Covid months ago and are now testing negative into two weeks in MIQ.  &gt;Covid Minister Chris Hipkins said yesterday he plans for double-vaccinated healthy Kiwis to be allowed to avoid MIQ altogether in the first quarter of 2022, but political pressure will bring that forward to before Christmas. There will be no MIQ for double-vaxxed healthy Kiwis returning home from holidays abroad this January.  &gt;Expect the double-jabbed, negative-test rule to be extended to tourists and overseas students well ahead of the current timeline. Already, the Ministry of Education says the Government will allow 1000 foreign students into New Zealand next year, 400 of them pilot trainees as well as 300 university and 300 polytechnic students. Who knew that private flight schools had better lobbyists than the state tertiary institutions? Expect universities, polytechnics and secondary schools to redouble their advocacy in the next few weeks.  &gt;Led by the University of Auckland, all tertiary institutions will soon require all staff and students to be double-jabbed to step on campus. Even as the Government radically expands compulsory vaccination in the workforce, it will soon not be possible for young people to get any job requiring so much as a polytechnic certificate without first being double-jabbed.  &gt;Beehive strategists say the intention is that the legislation to be passed next month allowing employers to make vaccination a condition of employment will be written permissively so that, in practice, it covers almost everyone.  &gt;As Education Minister, Hipkins has already allowed senior secondary students back to school, and announced a target of November 15 for primary and intermediate schools.  &gt;Presumably year 9 and 10 students will be also be allowed back. While teachers are not legally required to be vaccinated by November 15, they can be given notice if they aren't in time for term 1.  &gt;For their younger students, MedSafe will formally decide when children under 12 can be vaccinated. But it is not unknown for senior Beehive staffers to explain to independent decision-makers what prime ministers think, just as a courtesy you understand.  &gt;With the politicians and bureaucrats having learned their lesson from their original failure to order vaccines, expect children aged 5 to 11 to start being jabbed in a few weeks.  &gt;Meanwhile, vaccination rates, including among Māori, continue to rise, especially now Wellington bureaucrats and District Health Boards (DHBs) are out of the way of local providers. Auckland is on track to meet the 90 per cent target around December 1, the date Ardern's opponents have nominated for Freedom Day. Expect her to adopt a Freedom Day by another name, whatever vaccination rates are in late November. The shops, bars and restaurants will re-open for the December peak.  &gt;Ardern also knows internal borders are unsustainable for much longer, and certainly unthinkable by mid-December. Even if vaccination rates in the Northland DHB haven't reached 90 per cent by Christmas, Ardern knows she cannot create economic misery in the poorest part of the country by preventing its tourism sector from operating through the summer.  &gt;The same applies to Coromandel, the Bay of Plenty, Taupō and other regions highly reliant on tourism. In any case, Aucklanders won't stand for not having a summer holiday after nearly four months of lockdown. The border between Auckland and Northland, including by sea, would become impossible to police.  &gt;Yes, Ardern's decisions mean the hospitals will be stretched and there will be Covid deaths, almost exclusively among the unvaxxed. But the path is now basically set. And much better we embrace the new normal before summer than delaying the inevitable transition until autumn or the winter.  Posted for the read.

They've changed tack multiple times now on their optimum schedule for dosing. Let's count:  * They initially stated 3 weeks because they didn't know any better at the start of the rollout, at the same time the U.K. was already giving 12 week gaps between doses. * They switched to 6 weeks when COVID hit because they left vaccine procurement to the last minute and needed to save doses. * They've now switched back to 3 weeks because they're rushing to meet arbitrary numbers.   None of that is based in evidence. It's based on mismanagement and logistical failings.  &gt; thinking you know better than the government  Do tell me more though about how this government, which has cocked up the alert level system, showed no consistency in vaccination certificate policy, and has had one of the latest nationwide rollouts of vaccines in the world knows better though.  &gt;  then you can complain  I'm fine with my decision being founded in evidence, thanks.

If we take the latest of those different dates and vaccine certificates aren't fully functional until mid-December, there's a chance Auckland's DHBs will reach the golden 90 per cent vaccination threshold before the certificates are ready to go.        But fundamentally, if you think I shouldn't be quibbling over four or six weeks, you're right!        It's astonishing New Zealand doesn't have a fully functional vaccine passport system already developed and tested. Almost every developed country has a system in place. Israel launched its vaccine passport system in February. New York introduced vaccine passports in March. As National's Chris Bishop pointed out yesterday, Cuba has a vaccine passport system. Burkina Faso has a vaccine passport system!        But as recently as the start of August, in an interview with the Herald's Claire Trevett, Jacinda Ardern ruled out using vaccine passports in New Zealand. This was at a time when New South Wales was already recording hundreds of new infections a day.        Naivety or hubris? Why wouldn't New Zealand need vaccine passports when everyone else did? What makes us so special?        At the very least, the delay points to complacency. The development of a domestic vaccine passport system should have been a priority from the moment we placed our order with Pfizer, even if it later proved New Zealand never needed to use it.        That vaccine certificates aren't already functional tells us officials did not sufficiently prepare for a scenario in which New Zealand couldn't eliminate the virus.        We've been caught flat-footed with vaccine certificates because we thought we were different to everyone else. We thought we were better.        We were wrong.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/qdqw85/jack_tame_vaccine_certificates_should_have_been/hho7qx4/

The real answer is around our supply issues, this caused a huge bottleneck in our response to rush for a 3rd and 4th quarter drive for vaccination. Whatever it took we should have tried to ge more supply  earlier or be in talks with Moderna for the other mRNA vaccine. On top of this as Jack points out the certificate aspect was not being actively developed it seemed. These things were being talked about last year at length in many tech and government circles internationally.   I can't remember who said it but awhile back in the media someone pointed out we need two teams in government. The on the ground here and now response team and the future planning forward thinking response team. The government seems to be stretched thin and working with the hard challenges of the day to days which leaves them open to overlooking and planning for the longer term.   It is disappointing and what makes me more disappointed is this (rightfully so) means a lot of other massive issues are put on hold to deal with covid response.

Ignore anything about pilot group/trusted witness/unique code, it's not applicable right now.  My Covid Record is a work in progress.

697,339,0,1632887802,"&gt;New Zealand’s vaccination rate has fallen off a cliff.   &gt;   &gt;Just 12,641 people got a first dose on Monday, the lowest weekday total since mid-July, when most people under the age of 65 were not yet eligible for a shot.   &gt;   &gt;This isn’t a blip: the average daily rate has dropped to about 20,000 a day in the last week, less than half the lockdown-fuelled rate of 55,000 managed earlier this month.   &gt;   &gt;And it looks to be getting worse, too. The number of people booked in for a vaccine has barely moved in the last week, growing by just 50,000.   &gt;   &gt;The spike in people getting their second dose will mask how bad this situation is over the next few weeks, but those people were locked-in six weeks ago – if New Zealand wants to grow its vaccinated population to the kind of levels where it can safely lift restrictions, it will need to get far more people without a single jab signing up for one.   &gt;   &gt;If bookings continue to grow at that kind of rate, it would take months to get vaccine coverage up to that 90 per cent of the eligible population the prime minister keeps talking about. Currently, just 75 per cent of the 12+ population has a jab, while 78 per cent are booked. If bookings keep growing by just 50,000 a week it would take another 13 weeks to even get 90 per cent booked in – that’s the end of December.   &gt;   &gt;Even if we ignore bookings and just assume the Government keeps giving our first doses at its current anaemic rate, which seems unlikely given the continued drop off through the last three weeks, then it would take until November 1 for 90 per cent of eligible Kiwis to get a first dose.   &gt;   &gt;This problem is not unique to New Zealand and was entirely foreseeable. About 64 per cent of the entire country has had a single jab or more. Many other countries are stuck around here in the 60s. The United States has been here for about a month. Germany and the United Kingdom stalled out a bit higher, but not much higher.   &gt;   &gt;That doesn’t mean it is impossible: Several other democratic countries have got rates far higher – notably Portugal, Denmark, and Uruguay. Our Government should be studying their approaches closely.   &gt;   &gt;Notably, Denmark and Portugal have set clear vaccine targets, rewarding citizens with loosened controls once they are reached. They have also been very comfortable restricting people without either a vaccination certificate or a recent negative test from attending bars and restaurants.   &gt;   &gt;These tools appear to be working far better than small-dollar incentives or large lotteries attempted by several US states, and suggested by former prime minister Sir John Key over the weekend.   &gt;   &gt;Down here in New Zealand, the Government has finally promised a digital vaccine certificate within a month. But it’s still somewhat wishy-washy on how much these could be used to restrict people from their workplaces or from venues.   &gt;   &gt;Ministers need to be much clearer and give private companies some certainty.   &gt;   &gt;Restaurants and employers will be understandably wary of getting too far ahead of the public or the legal sphere on this one. Most Kiwis agree that border workers should be forced into either getting a jab or being fired – but it’s unclear whether or not they would support such a policy being applied to all jobs that require close contact indoors.   &gt;   &gt;Similarly, there is a risk of going too far when barring people from certain venues. Sure, it seems reasonable to bar someone without a jab (or negative test) from a crowded concert venue: But what about a super-market? Or a church? People do have a right to both refuse medical treatment and participate in something like normal life.   &gt;   &gt;Epidemiologist Michael Baker’s suggestion that Air NZ bar the unvaccinated from domestic flights could cause a huge amount of drama with the vocally unvaccinated. It also assumes that those not getting the vaccine are flying around the country with regularity.   &gt;   &gt;This is the kind of problem only strong central leadership can fix. Some idea of light at the end of the tunnel might help.   &gt;   &gt;Even with clear targets and strong incentives to get vaccinated, some people will be hard to reach. This won’t be because they are dyed-in-the-wool anti-vaxxers, it will be because they are hard to reach with most things. About a million people don’t vote every election.   &gt;   &gt;They are counted on the census only because Statistics NZ makes painstaking efforts to knock on every door in the country. These people have every right to not really pay attention to public life – that’s the beauty of a stable democracy – but the Government should be mimicking the census and going door-to-door to reach them.   &gt;   &gt;None of these interventions will be silver bullets, and we may never reach the top of the tables for vaccinations. But New Zealand is a strongly-centralised rich country that manages to get close to 100 per cent of its babies inoculated. Trust in our institutions is generally high.   &gt;   &gt;The Government has political cover and all the money it needs to run a pretty-extensive catch-up plan for this last portion of the community, with carrots and sticks aplenty. It should get to it.  An important piece I feel. Especially off the back of todays case numbers. ""Living with covid"" as much as I hate that phrase, is something that we're going to have to seriously consider sooner than we thought. Yes the pandemic is dynamic, unpredictable, and rapidly evolving, and expecting a concrete long-term plan isn't realistic. But we need more certainty on what we know for sure. And we know for sure that we're going to be living with covid in the community.

Most covid cases outside of elderly people are mild.  &gt;Hipkins said the elderly and people with co-morbidities, or pre-existing medical conditions, were likely to targetted “early-on” in the roll-out of the mass vaccination campaign.  Nearly everyone who gets hospitalised with covid are in these groups. Once they are vaccinated the hospitalisation rate from case numbers will plummet. This is why the UK is doing staged re-opening in parallel with the rollout.  &gt;“It is so important that those who can be, are [vaccinated]. Because if we get to the point where we have a significant portion of the population who can be vaccinated, are vaccinated. That means that we provide immunity and protection for others.”  Once everyone over 40 has been offered the vaccine there isn't much justification to continue with alert levels and lockdowns and obsess over case numbers and elimination.

767,39,1,1640769663,"Yes, the lockdowns initially were justifiable, we needed time, there were too many unknowns. The second lockdown was a direct result of labour's incompetence and shortsightedness. They should have pushed vaccines earlier to higher risk groups.  By your argument we can justify an inconvenience to another person if it saves their life. I agree. This is a reasonable cost, if it's minor and I also expect it to make sense and be voluntary. However, much more than a minor inconvenience is not a good idea. It's simply not clearly beneficial to use a coercive (i.e. harnessing the force of the state) method for enforcing this. A restaurant being fined 20k is in my view disproportionate to the risk, and heavy handed. No one wants people to die... (do I need to even say this?) but a vaccine passport is --not-- going to prevent that at this point... in a town with zero covid community cases it does not make sense to be using the current approach. To suggest that we hold off everyones lives so that people can live in a bubble is not realistic, and it's frankly pretty selfish.   If your dad wants to minimise his risk then he should get the vaccine (and booster), and should also avoid smoking, should exercise regularly and eat a plant based diet. Obesity is a key risk factor so I hope he's been exercising for the last 18 months so that he is less likely to end up in ICU... Do you catch my drift here? The current narrative is not focused on individual responsibility, but rather the sacrifices that every has to make for high risk people. Maybe I'm high risk, there's no point in including my own medical history here. It doesn't change my view point here. Protect the vulnerable and incompetent, reduce your own factors for severe disease where able, and proportionally to your own assessment of the risks from covid. Vaccination appears to be very effective against the more deadly strains but of less help against omicron (which is weak anyway). Effective social distancing helps. Signs and QR contact tracing are only as helpful as the rules and enforcement. The way we use them currently is stupid, and fining this restaurant is more of Jacinda's unnecessary bullshit.

Consider an unrepentant paedophile who is sexually attracted to children and refuses to participate in therapy to change this.  They were not convicted of a crime, however because it is known they are a higher risk of causing harm to children than the general public, there has been restrictions put on where they are allowed to go, and who they can interact with to decrease the chance of harm.  In this scenario, you are arguing that while you aren't attracted to children, you hate the thought that someone who is a greater risk of preying on children being kept apart and not being allowed to go to swimming pools and schools where they are near children.  The vaccine passport is meant to serve 2 purposes - to keep a physical separation for the purposes of protection, and by the fact people want to avoid that separation, to encourage them to get vaccinated and thus remove the increased risk which warrants that protection.  I understand the idea that from a moral standpoint it doesn't seem right that there are limitations being put on some people...but it's intended to protect people from legitimate medical risk.  We pretty much have to be around strangers, but we don't have to be around strangers who also have considerably-higher risk of being infected and infectious.  From a practical standpoint, so long as we can't vaccinate all children against the virus (and children can expose adults and higher-risk people to the virus) we are no-where near the requirements for herd immunity where it would be acceptable from a standpoint of medical risk...to increase the risk for us all by removing the location restrictions from those who represent that higher risk.  There are probably more at-risk people in NZ who are immunosuppressed or have other reasons why Covid would cause them imminent danger who would feel the need to restrict themselves to protect themselves....than the number of anti-vaxxers who would benefit from being allowed to join them in closed, indoor, higher-risk locations.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/rhbsgx/covid19_milestone_90pc_of_new_zealanders_are_now/hoqcxuh/

The people without vaccine require more social distancing to reduce the spread thus different restrictions apply.   This is all the light system does.

929,201,0,1638063022,"&gt; So as I suspected, you're not looking at the whole picture. &gt;  &gt; Freedoms are defined by laws and such laws tend to be delicate. Adding something like a vaccine pass that allows organisations to block service to specific individuals needs to go through the proper checks and balances to make sure its limited to just what is required, doesn't over step and doesn't have loopholes that could be used for other purposes.   None of this happened though. In fact, you have the facts pretty much exactly opposite to what actually happened.   First factual error: The law had not even been drafted at the time the government commissioned the vaccine passport system. This is because it's not actually necessary to decide the *legal* details of the implementation at the time you make the app - you can develop the app first, and then decide when and where it must be used. Conclusion: The government waiting for long legal processes was not the cause of our slowness.    Secondly, when the legislation was eventually introduced - on 23rd November - it *bypassed* all the normal checks and balances. It passed less than 24 hours after it was first introduced. In the words of Dr Dean Knight (Assoc. Prof. Victoria University, member of NZ Centre for Public Law, co-chair of Australasian chapter of the International Society of Public Law, executive committee member of the Law and Society Association of Australia and New Zealand (LSAANZ), editorial committee of the NZ Journal of Public and International Law):  &gt;It is a constitutional disgrace that the legislation mandating this vaccination regime is being passed urgently this week, without provision for prior/adequate consultation on the legislative framework. Whether you support the new Covid protection framework (which I do) or not, legislative change seriously implicating rights like this needs much more time to breathe, to be interrogated and for its legitimacy to be built through dialogue. *From a quick look, also concerning is the framework is empowering only, leaving much of the detail of the protection framework/vaccination mandates to be settled in Covid-19 orders made by the minister. Again, quite concerning - esp given the novelty of the measures* ...That perhaps a suite of further judicial review applications challenging vax mandates in the new year... Joy. 🙄  He goes on to list a variety of other problems with the rushed process in [this 56 tweet long thread \(make sure you scroll all the way to the top\)](https://twitter.com/drdeanknight/status/1463200066592591878). I think an esteemed public law expert describing something as a ""constitution disgrace"" ought to trigger some alarm bells, and clearly indicates checks and balances have not been followed.    The part in italics is important and I'll return to that later, but first lets look at a non-comprehensive list of other public law experts who have critiqued the government in incredibly strong terms for *bypassing* all the checks and balances that they could have gone through if they had started things earlier:  * [NZ Human Rights Commission](https://www.hrc.co.nz/news/scrutiny-and-public-input-needed-urgently-new-covid-19-legislation-says-human-rights-commission/) * [New Zealand Law Society](https://www.lawsociety.org.nz/news/law-society-statements/law-society-raises-concerns-about-passage-of-covid-19-response-vaccinations-legislation-act-2021/) * [Trevor Mallard \(A Labour MP! and speaker of the house\)](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/127082246/speaker-trevor-mallard-lashes-government-for-urgently-passing-covid19-law?cid=app-iPhone) * [Geoff McLay \(Prof. Victoria University, Former Law Commissioner, Former Chair of the Legislation Design Advisory Committee, Editor of NZ Law Reports\)](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/127082246/speaker-trevor-mallard-lashes-government-for-urgently-passing-covid19-law?cid=app-iPhone) * Every party in parliament other than Labour * [Eddie Clark](https://twitter.com/Publicwrongs/status/1463230874695061506) (Senior Lecturer Victoria University)  Regarding the italics: One of the issues Dr Knight raises is that the legislation that passed is actually incredibly incomplete - the existing legislation doesn't actually contain most of the framework, but just gives the minister of covid-19 response sweeping powers to implement a whole bunch of orders that will eventually become the framework. To be clear, the parts of the law that mandate the use of the vaccine certificates cannot have gone through checks and balances, because those parts of the laws do not exist yet - they exist only when Chris Hipkins issues a public health order.   This is known as secondary legislation. According to the government's own legislation advisory committee, the framework would clearly be more appropriate for primary legislation:  &gt; As a general rule, matters of significant policy and principle should be included in an Act. Secondary legislation should generally deal with minor or technical matters of implementation and the operation of the Act ... The following matters should generally (or in some cases always) be addressed in primary legislation:  &gt;* matters of significant policy; * matters significantly affecting fundamental human rights; * the creation of significant public powers such as search and seizure or confiscation of property;    - http://www.ldac.org.nz/guidelines/legislation-guidelines-2021-edition/issues-particularly-relevant-to-empowering-secondary-legislation-2/chapter-14/  I'm sorry, but if you think the reason our response has been slow is because the government is going through all the checks and balances, you just haven't been paying attention.    &gt;There's also the fact that it's revealing medical information so that needs to be checked too.  That's a really, really good reason to sign the contract and get everything in motion *earlier*, so developers aren't rushed. More development time = more time can be allocated to testing to find and quash security issues.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/r34wd0/jacinda_ardern_says_new_zealand_is_prepared_for/hmcgrxx/

As to the media, they 100% were gas lighting people and labeling people as conspiracy theorist who believed that boosters would be required and that vaccine passports will be a reality. Many ordinary people believed this vaxxed or un vaxxed, many experts also acknowledged this possibility too. It is the media that has unnecessary delivered 'anti vaxxers' a complete victory on these topics throught their reckless coverage.   As for vaccine passports not being 'new', I do disagree there.  A vaccine passport on this scale and with this wide of a reach with consequences as sever as they are under this new framework, there really is no historical equivalent in my view and certainly in theirs too.   The way I see it, there are two factors at play with these Covid-19 restrictions and either side of the argument is choosing to deny the existence of one of them. 1 is public health and 2, is about government controll. Most of the 'anti vax' or 'anti Covid vax' groups see all of this purely as an attempt by governments to gain more power and use said power to fundamentally change society, many believe that this has nothing to do with public health because they they think Covid is either fake, or a slightly bad flu season.   For the staunchly pro vax groups (yes they exist and they're arguably just as bad as anti vaxxers with regards to misinformation and constant moaning), they believe this is all about public health, and that there are no opportunistic power grabs going on, no abuse going on, no sinister underlying motives. It's all rather naive in my view to see governmentsas this benevolent organization that will always has our best intentions at heart. They have a level of trust in their government that anti vaxxers don't share, so while they're willing to giver government the benefit of the doubt  anti vaxxers aren't.

If you want to engage in any situation outside the house, scan a vax passport or be refused.  I would also be fine with established isolated communities not being vaccinated (Gloriavale for example), because there is no risk to them.  My thinking is, we can reduce covid to the point of elimination *if* we don’t allow it anywhere to go.  I understand the rest of the world has taken a “let ‘er rip” approach, and even just one large trading/tourism partner that refuses to try to eliminate means it can’t ever work (so the US would screw it up for everyone), but in my ideal world once we established the vaccine was safe (which I think we have), then I want that sucker in all 7 billion arms within 6 months and we *actually* remove covid-19 entirely.  Realistically in New Zealand, I’d like a mandate on any retail, in both directions.  This would extend to supermarkets, which is contentious because it would mean people objecting can’t buy food - so, they would need to order online and take delivery.  That delivery would be contactless.  We still retain the veneer of choice, but now (to use your word because it is absolutely appropriate) with a very heavy degree of coercion.

1091,363,0,1636481362,"I'm in a similar boat to you.   Vaccinated myself but disagree with mandates for a few reasons:  1. I'm not convinced that the ""social tensions"" that arise from locking \~10% of the adult population out of employment, recreational opportunities etc are worth it for the extra percentage of vaccine uptake. There will be collateral damage here that is hard to quantify and make take some time to fully make its effects felt. For example mum and dad are anti-vax so lose their jobs ... the kids - through no fault of their own - experience a substantial decline in standard of living, opportunities etc. No doubt this also risks fuelling extreme behaviour from some (take away people's ability to feed themselves and see how they can start to behave) It may feel cathartic now to see anti-vaxxers be punished, locked out of society and so on, but I believe in time we will see that as having been a bad idea as the ""long tail"" of effects from this is felt.  2. Looking at health expert insight from European countries like Germany, there seems evidence the Covid passport system is potentially worsening Covid's spread. This is because the vaccinated believe they are ""invincible"" (or at least 'the average Joe' does because he/she has been sold the idea that Covid vaccines are infallible) so they drop all other protective measures e.g. frequent hand washing, mask wearing, social distancing etc. The layperson still believes that Covid vaccines work like the ones you had has a kid - i.e. you take the vaccine and then you cannot really get infected or transmit the disease. However, Covid vaccines seem to work more like 'symptom mitigators' (at least after a short while) so you can still get spread amongst the vaccinated. Look at Waterford County in Ireland for example - around 99.5% of adults are fully-vaccinated there, but they have some of the worst case growth in all of Ireland. At the same time the unvaccinated will be driven underground to meet in private, where there is far more chance that Covid spreads aggressively through that community. 3. There are a number of promising treatment products (e.g. new Pfizer pill) coming down the pipeline. These should help to keep hospitalisations lower, and ultimately may prove more effective than vaccination.  4. The implementation here seems arse about face. Isn't the point that once we hit 90%, modelling has projected that we won't see the health system overrun? Therefore, once we hit 90% (which is when the traffic light system is meant to kick in with the Covid passport) why do we need the restrictions in the first place?",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/qq82bl/important_update_daily_covid19_discussion_thread/hjyp95d/

So Today there is a business which sits in Wellington central under level 2, it is currently operating quite safely, masks and scanning etc. Some of its patrons are vaccinated and some aren't. Then the population reaches 90% vaccinated status, that business must refuse service to unvaccinated individuals. If they do not discriminate, they will have to become a no contact business and will be unable to get any subsidy.

We're basically being held hostage now by the lack of an app, but it's mitigated by the fact that we haven't quite hit 90%, so the app isn't needed *just* yet for most people.  But there are still businesses who want to be able to validate their staff, and it's being done on an honour-basis right now, but can't be verified.  That's why I say it should have been ready a month ago.  &gt; You dont give her credit for the country successes and blame her for failures. I do..  I'm not sure what you mean by that ? Did you mean ""and then *NOT* blame her for failures"" ?  If so, I'm not giving the goverment a free pass here, I'm not saying that everything they do is perfect - I mentioned that earlier in one of my other replies.  They could have done better, and they could still do better, particularly around the availability of the vaccine passport app.   But *overall*, the government's response has been good, and they've got far more things right than they have got wrong.   As for health care, yes, we could have invested in attracting more medical staff here over the last year or so.  But that wouldn't necessarily have helped with ICU capacity, as it takes years of experience to get someone ready to be an ICU nurse.  Yes, they could have started on that, and they did begin an overhaul of the health care system, but they still have problem with horribly low wages and understaffing, which could certainly have been better.  But the decisions around lockdown, the restrictions imposed (and for how long), and the financial support that's been available, have meant that for *most* of the time, the NZ economy, and every day life, has been relatively normal.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/qjecap/national_calls_for_royal_commission_into_delta/hiqejn6/

There are numerous issues with this approach.  The passport (to be released next month) will be a separate QR code that contains a digital signature that is cryptographically signed by MoH. The validators will scan the signature and use public/private key encryption to validate that the certificate was created specifically by the MoH. That is all that would be needed to verify a person's status.

Especially if they want functionality for booster shots or future vaccines. But an absolutely bastardized high school level solution would be preferable to just keeping everyone in lockdown.

1312,584,12,1635066062,"Happy to engage in a conversation on this, as I have been really struggling to find people who wish to discuss actual facts and how they are arrived at. As opposed to the rhetoric which seems to be really derisive among so many these days.  Because I certainly don’t claim to have any sort of medical training, you will have to bear with me on some of my questions. - 31 were unlikely to be caused by Covid. How was this conclusion arrived at, and who came to this conclusion . What is the basis or parameters that the MoH uses to define this? - 26 do not have sufficient information for a conclusion. Who arrived at that decision, and based on what? It seems strange that in this current Covid aware environment, that anyone who passed away, within a short time of receiving medical treatment, that the information required about these situations is unavailable. Our hospital aren’t currently so stretched, that basic and important reporting isn’t being performed. - the 6.5 million doses given out , 70% of those its a second dose, so your maths needs to be changed to reflect that, your maths is based on people and then you base it on doses. You also havent allowed for the number of people in that 50 000 who dispite being vaccinated will still die. It needs to be in there for accuracy.  However even when you account for that I agree that the numbers still stack up for vaccinating over unvaxxed. Across the vast majority of the age groups. But i still believe all we can do is put the information in front of people, so that informed choices can be made by all of the hesitating ones, rather than the current course of continued, them and us policy’s.  You very obviously have an interest or strong knowledge on this subject, so I would also be interested in your thoughts around the vaccine itself.  From what information I have managed to gather and read (some of it I am still having to reread to make sure I have understood things correctly) the Pfizer vaccine seems to be the pick of the bunch for results available at this point. It seems to have performed the best in both reducing the likely hood of vaccinated people catching Covid and also when vaccinated people do catch it, the Pfizer vaccinated people seem to have the least amount of hospital admissions and severe symptoms. So from what i can see our government has made the right choice on which vaccine to go with.  Once I started looking at the vaccine itself (so far I have had a couple of discussions with Doctors I know, who both work in ICU units in Chch and Wellington, and then since those discussions I have used a couple of different sources to try and research the chemistry behind the vaccine, mainly the British medical journal and then links to different studies from this source. If any of the questions i am about to ask you dont sound right or you think i have got it wrong let me know and i will find the links i used to get this info). I would also add that i fully understand a lot of the work around this particular vaccine has had to be forced and rushed to allow whats effectively the pick of the bunch to be out there and being used.  The part of the vaccine I am struggling to fully understand is the PEG2000. I understand its the delivery system for the spike, that activates our immune system, to combat the virus. If i understand things correctly, the issue they have is the spike only has a very short life span, once its in our blood, and generally will be dead (i presume killed by our existing antibodies, but i am only guessing at that) with in a very short time of entering our system, it needs to survive for 2 to 3 weeks to do its job properly. The PEG2000 coats the spike in a protective coating to allow it to survive for the required time before breaking down naturally in our body. PEG2000 is polyethylene glycol . Polyethylene glycol is manufactured from polypropelene glycol. It’s manufactured by adding ethylene oxide with the polypropelene glycol. The byproduct of this chemical reaction is a number of extremely carcinogenic components. These are then removed and you are left with the polyethylene glycol. This has a number of uses in the medical industry, but has been predominantly used as a laxative, taken in oral form.  The main use it has had (prior to being used in the current Pfizer vaccine) in a intravenous use, has been used as a delivery system for some very strong chemotherapy drugs. When the British medical journal decided to run some trials on the effects of PEG2000 when used in a intravenous form, the only use was for delivery of chemo drugs. The conclusion they came to (released in June 2019 you can find it on their web site) was that it worked very effectively in allowing the clinicians to deliver the correct drugs to the intended target in the body. However they also put a rather significant disclaimer with it. They also found that due to the large amount of damage done to the patient by the chemo drug itself, it was impossible to tell if any of the issues were caused by the PEG2000 or the chemo drug. They concluded that while it looked promising a lot more work was required to ascertain what the medium and long term effects of this chemical will be on our bodies. They also mentioned that Quality control in the manufacturing process was going to be critical, as even trace amounts of the carcinogenic byproducts from manufacturing would be deadly with a number of different cancers particularly lymphatic cancers.  By necesity there hasn’t been time to complete any of these trials. So effectively we are Guinea pigs for this delivery system, rather than it going through the standard medical trial system.  Pfizers have been forced to ramp up their manufacturing enormously to allow them to try and supply world wide demand. What has been done to ensure a private company that is profit focused, is also totally committed to a QC system to ensure that during this enormous and no doubt challenging manufacturing ramp up process that QC isn’t suffering, as obviously the long term down sides could be very significant.  Again I am not saying that the current vaccine has these carcinogenic by products or that the PEG2000 is going to cause us issues. However i also cant get any powers to be or people in control of our response to engage on these issues either. It’s always either ignored, or i am given the answer that these are things that are at a higher level and i dont need to know about it, we must just trust the powers to be.  I am sure you can understand that answering questions that people have, with those type of responses, only makes most people want to find out more information.  For the record I am vaccinated for the following - Hepatitis A and B - Cholera - TB - Polio - yellow fever - Tetanus I spent 10 years living in different parts of Africa, and had to be vaccinated for all of these items, I still have my international vaccine passport. I experienced two Cholera outbreaks in the place i lived and saw the devastation this created on the unvaccinated. We also had to constantly be aware of hepatitis outbreaks in the water. So I believe myself to be far from a anti vaxxer (most of the ones I have ever met, are mad). My concerns are around the speed this has been brought to being considered safe. I totally understand we needed something to combat what has been sweeping the world, but it worries me that these basic questions I have, I am really struggling to get straight answers on.

It even lives in pools of animals. Compared to smallpox it is extremely slippery in terms of elimination.

1322,594,6,1634948562,"A LETTER TO OUR PRIME MINISTER...   Dear Jacinda,   I am a New Zealander...a mother and a grandmother.   The closest i have been to you was when we jigged side by side in the VIP area of a U2 concert a couple of years ago.  I remember thinking how tiny and pretty you were.   I am a sensitive empath, and watching the pain in your eyes as you comforted the bereaved and traumatised after the mosque massacre, and White Island...i thought i recognised the same in you.   I know your Misinformation Officer will quickly find this post and hopefully share it with you...   I am taking it upon myself to share a grassroots snapshot in time, of the immense suffering so many of your people are enduring right now.   I host a community of nearly 35,000 New Zealanders whose lives have been changed by the Covid 19 vaccine.   Many who gather here are living with the daily legacy of suffering serious adverse reactions to our ""safe and effective"" covid solution.   Some are paralysed or have lost their health and vitality as a result of a stroke, heart attack, blood clot or myocarditis after their jab.   Others are dealing with a paralysed face, or ongoing extreme exhaustion, crippling pain or daily headaches that see them confined to bed for weeks on end.  When they try to share their story (as many thousands tried to on your recent face book post), they are smashed with angry vitriol...cries of ""misinformation"" and ""antivaxer""...even though they were ""pro vax"" enough to roll up their sleeve for the needle.   Having unexpectedly created a safe place for these marginalised and injured to gather, gives me daily insight into a New Zealand story the likes of which most unwitting Kiwi's have no awareness of.  All they hear every day is ""safe and effective....and they trust you and believe it.   The personal interactions i have with these families will leave a permanent heavy record in my heart.    I often think of the family whose beautiful brilliant medical specialist daughter is left permanently crippled by her post jab stroke.    Or the 22 year old woman who had to learn to walk and talk again after her stroke, following the jab she didnt want to have, but gave in to, in order to keep her job.   The family just 3 weeks ago who are wracked with trauma and grief after their precious 14 year old son collapsed dead in their garden, 3 days after his jab.    I have literally hundreds of such stories to share with you....as do the many who tried, unsuccessfully, to do so on your recent face book post.   You wont see a single one of them on the 6 o'clock news, the 1 o'clock update or the front page of the Herald.    Of course i realise that the vast majority of Kiwis will have their jab and have nothing more than a sore arm...but for many others life is changed and these broken Kiwis (who did the right thing!!) deserve our compassionate acknowledgement and care, not our scorn and disbelief.   And now there is a new tsunami of grief and suffering growing....the thousands of New Zealanders who are now faced with a choice they believed would never be forced upon them.    Do they take a jab, that for a myriad of reasons they have chosen not to have....or do they lose their job, vocation, career of decades?   While some will find the fear of unemployment and financial destitution enough to drag them, kicking and screaming to the vaccine tent...   For others, no amount of pressure, coercion or personal cost will be enough to wrestle a consent from their arm.  I have received hundreds of messages from these soon to be unemployed experts.    We are set to loose literally thousands of years of vocational experience from the New Zealand work force.  Doctors, nurses, teachers, psychiatrists, midwives and more.  Yes even an Orthopedic Surgeon and a Forensic Psychiatrist will be walking.  Some who are new to their careers and still paying off student loans....others with 20 or 30 years of valuable experience.   To those who have already had their jab, this might seem pure insanity.  Why would a professional with everything to lose, not just simply call in to the vax centre at the end of a work shift, and be done with the turmoil, pressure and angst?   I'll share just a tiny few of the myriad reasons these incredible people have shared with me.   The reasons can be grouped, and the first group hinges on TRUST.   Try as they might, some just cannot rationalise their way into a place of trusting either Pfizer,  or you and our Government.   They struggle to believe that the largest corporate and pharmaceutical felons in history can just be ""trusted"" with a rapidly developed, novel technology, medical product with absolutely ZERO long term safety data.    They also struggle with knowing that the contract our Government signed with Pfizer is confidential, and includes (this much we know) 100% liability protection for Pfizer.    These injured Kiwi's I've spoken about...if they are lucky their financial care will come from ACC (its not a given though).  That's us.  The tax payers.  An ""all care, no responsibility"" contract with a pharmaceutical company with a track record like Pfizer, simply does not inspire confidence in those who do their due diligence.   Others of these smart and educated professionals (including many medics) have spent many hours reading the clinical trial papers, following the government adverse reaction (and efficacy) databases around the world.   They are deeply concerned by what they see. Unprecedented serious injury and death, the likes of which have never been witnessed with a vaccine before.  With the exception of the many times inflated risk of heart inflammation in young males, the other serious injuries (or worse) seem to be randomly meted out as a form of medical Russian Roulette.   There is another group of soon to be unemployed, who have health issues that in any ""ordinary"" times, would see them exempted or even contraindicated from receiving this vaccine.  Long histories of blood clots, heart attacks, neurodegeneration conditions, and yes even previous severe and life threatening allergic reactions.   Instead they find themselves mandated, terrorised and terrified....including those who nearly died from their first dose, and are simply told they MUST have their second dose in a hospital with a crash cart and a resuscitation team at hand.   Then comes the group, often also encompassing the first two groups, who will walk away from their career as a stand for medical freedom.    These people believe that capitulating against their will to take a medical intervention, with unprecedented evidence of damage from around the world, is the greater of two evils.   Those with intelligence have so many unanswered questions...   Why do they not have the option of presenting a negative saliva test twice a week to ensure they are safe in the work place? (firstly....why do we not have $20 saliva tests available like the rest of the world?)   Why is an ""immunity passport"" based on evidence of covid antibodies from previous infection, not enough to safely keep their job?   Why has our Government put no effort into providing us with an effective Early Treatment Outpatient program such as that used with overwhelming success by Dr Peter McCullough or Dr Zelenko?  Instead those in MIQ are offered panadol while they wait to see if their infection will lead them to ICU.   Why are we not checking the vitamin D status of every man woman and child in the land, and providing them with safe and effective doses of vitamin D...now that we know so clearly that low vitamin D makes us a sitting target for both infection and a poor outcome (and we have endemic vitamin D deficiency in NZ with our ""sun smart"" messaging).   Why have we not used the last 20 months to educate, empower and lead our nation into a better state of health....starting with sharing the brutal truth that obesity greatly increases your risk of ICU and death.   Why have you done everything in your power to block our access to Ivermectin when the evidence of both the safety and efficacy for prevention and treatment of Covid is overwhelmingly positive?  Why are we not having any national debate and discussion around the risk/benefit analysis of vaccinating our children? New Zealanders have simply not been informed that their children face virtually no risk of a poor outcome from covid (unless their child is already severely health compromised).  They are similarly unaware that their children face very real risks from taking the vaccine, including up to 25 times the usual risk of heart inflammation (young males), along with its potentially life shortening consequences.   Why do most New Zealanders not understand that as double vaccinated they can still both contract and transmit covid, get seriously ill from covid and die of covid.    We just have to look at the heavily vaccinated countries like Singapore, Israel and UK, to see that it will take much more than this ""leaky"" vaccine to put an end to our misery.   Why have New Zealanders not been told that the vaccine passport they covet, will likely disappear into thin air if they refuse to consent to a booster every six months in order to be considered ""fully vaccinated""...along with the repeated re exposure to serious health risks.   I think enough has been said.    Your people are hurting....the vaccine injured or bereaved; the mandated and disillusioned, frightened and no longer trusting; and all those who have chosen (for a myriad of rational reasons) to decline the jab, and are now vilified, attacked, belittled second rate citizens in their own country.   Right now our nation has never felt more divided.    Mental health has never felt more thread bare.  And never before have more questions been left unanswered.   Jacinda...   Its not too late for you to show the same compassion we witnessed as you embraced the traumatised Muslims at the mosque.   Its not too late to work with your people instead of against them.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/qdtxal/what_is_your_opinions_on_this_letter_written_by/hhorgns/

1359,631,23,1634938782,"&gt;A month ago, when Grant Robertson first confirmed the Government was planning to use certificates, he said they'd aim to introduce them at the start of November.        Two weeks later, Dr Ashley Bloomfield had a different date in mind. The vaccine certificates, he said, should be ready in ""late November"".   &gt;   &gt;Yesterday, the timeline appeared to change again.        ""From mid-December, everyone in New Zealand should be able to access a digital vaccination certificate,"" said the official Covid-19 website.        After the discrepancy in dates was questioned, the wording on the Covid-19 website was promptly changed.   &gt;   &gt;""From later this year, everyone in New Zealand should be able to access a digital vaccination certificate,"" it said.        Then, late last night the website changed again, this time to ""the end of November"".        So is it mid-November, late-November, or mid-December that vaccine certificates in New Zealand will be downloadable and fully functional, where an individual's QR code can be scanned and cross-checked against a national database while protecting their private medical information?   &gt;   &gt;I might be accused of splitting hairs except for a couple of reasons.        If we take the latest of those different dates and vaccine certificates aren't fully functional until mid-December, there's a chance Auckland's DHBs will reach the golden 90 per cent vaccination threshold before the certificates are ready to go.        But fundamentally, if you think I shouldn't be quibbling over four or six weeks, you're right!        It's astonishing New Zealand doesn't have a fully functional vaccine passport system already developed and tested. Almost every developed country has a system in place. Israel launched its vaccine passport system in February. New York introduced vaccine passports in March. As National's Chris Bishop pointed out yesterday, Cuba has a vaccine passport system. Burkina Faso has a vaccine passport system!        But as recently as the start of August, in an interview with the Herald's Claire Trevett, Jacinda Ardern ruled out using vaccine passports in New Zealand. This was at a time when New South Wales was already recording hundreds of new infections a day.        Naivety or hubris? Why wouldn't New Zealand need vaccine passports when everyone else did? What makes us so special?        At the very least, the delay points to complacency. The development of a domestic vaccine passport system should have been a priority from the moment we placed our order with Pfizer, even if it later proved New Zealand never needed to use it.        That vaccine certificates aren't already functional tells us officials did not sufficiently prepare for a scenario in which New Zealand couldn't eliminate the virus.        We've been caught flat-footed with vaccine certificates because we thought we were different to everyone else. We thought we were better.

You actually don't require active COVID spread to have vaccines incentives. You can push vaccines while knowing nothing about spread, because the effectiveness of vaccines doesn't depend on an outbreak happening. For example, the government could have started developing the vaccine passport app several months ago, instead of waiting until now. Do you agree that it would be possible to develop a vaccine passport app not just on day 1 of the outbreak, but 100 days before the outbreak? None of the government's vaccine plans need to rely on an outbreak! The international evidence is already out there - it didn't all appear a week ago.   &gt;You will find out on Friday, like everyone else.  Yes, but it would be great if we found out several Fridays ago, because then more people would have been vaccinated in the mean time and the outbreak would be smaller.

I ask this because, if the passport did extend to most things, you may not technically be forcing the vaccine upon people, but you're essentially forcing them nonetheless.

Then 1 week later they announce an in principle decision to move to Level 2.5 on Monday 18 October, in time for schools to go back.  But it will be more like Level 2.8.  Hospitality limited to outdoor seating, 10 person limit on indoor social gatherings, gyms, bars and clubs still closed, schools open but with a mask mandate.     Of course cases will then grow, but not too quickly.  They may at the same time announce a drop in the vaccine dose gap from 6 back to 3 weeks for Auckland and say that further reductions in the Levels will be tied to vaccine targets and things like indoor seating in hospo will be for the fully vaccinated only, with work on the vaccine passport being progressed urgently.    Look for a reduction to more normal Level 2 in Mid-November and the border around Auckland being dropped in early December when the rest of the country catches up to Auckland for vaccination levels.    That's my prediction if numbers remain basically as they are now, or slightly up.  If they explode in the next week all bets are off.  If they drop back to single digits maybe they hold on to Level 3 longer to truly eliminate.

We are definitely further ""right"" politically than BC, but the urban centers are closer to the center for that perspective.  As a province, Alberta has hit ~70% of total population fully vaxxed (like 80% eligible). Issue is we're not really moving quickly towards 80% of total, so the 1200+ cases we get a day are just normal now. We have, I think, the highest per capita deaths in Canada as well (2663 with a population of 4.4 million or so). Our ICU capacity is pretty maxed out as is, surgeries are delayed, other provinces are on standby to help us out, etc...so the numbers could escalate quickly.  Calgary has hit about 80% eligible, and Edmonton is about the same. We've potentially started to plateau finally (fingers crossed the data holds), but the issue is the rural areas. They haven't even come close to those vaccination rates, and continue to spiral out of control (High Level for example in the North region, which is the lowest rate in the province ~22%). The North region has hit 100% ICU capacity, and some of the other rural ones are in the 90s. Edmonton and Calgary are both mid 80s last I checked, but the situation is clearly bad. 92% of ICU patients are unvaccinated. The government is still loathe to place restrictions back in, so we're to basically get through this as best we can.   The only saving grace is businesses and other organizations have started to push vaccine mandates, so it has helped to potentially drive the vaccination number up, but again it's centered in urban centers.

1592,864,13,1632872598,"tl;dr -- most of the problems I have with the list are explained away in the PDF.  ----  &gt;Supercharge the vaccine rollout;  How?  Key's ideas for doing this were (1) stupid and offensive and (2) weirdly obsessed with vouchers but they were mechanisms not aspirations.  Just mandate all vaccines... it's the best solution and you know it.  **What does a more detailed plan reveal?** Mechanisms, basically. They seem okay... good even (though I doubt they'll work... as they tacitly appear to acknowledge in saying mandates are required for healthcare workers: if their ideas are good enough why aren't they good enough for healthcare workers?).  &gt;Order vaccine boosters;  I'm inclined to agree that boosters are required. However, I also think that vaccinating people globally needs to be prioritised.  **What does a more detailed plan reveal?** Not much, frankly. You would hope that they at least address these concerns but they do not.  &gt;Upgrade our contact tracing capability;  This is also pointlessly aspirational but we've seen that they can do good mechanisms once already...  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** Vastly more than in the previous case. It looks like common sense things that should already have been done in, say, January this year.  &gt;Roll out saliva testing at the border and in the community  The only thing I can say straight up about this is something I'm not sure I actually read so I won't say it.  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** Basically, (1) saliva testing is just as effective, (2) it's far less invasive and, though this is only implicit, therefore (3) mandate daily testing for border workers, MIQ residents (on top of the current nasal tests) and hospital staff.  &gt;Roll out rapid tests for essential workers and in the community;  There are, again (see above), some ambiguities about what this means that might be readily resolved (is this daily, also?).  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** No it's intolerably, and unusually given the others, vague.   They seem to be suggesting a rapid test will just become a routine part of going to a GP or A&amp;E but that's not clear (it may even mean healthcare more generally). I'm pretty sure they're suggesting a rapid test on arrival in country but after that I'm a bit lost at what they want. They mention making rapid testing available to people to buy (how does this mesh with the contact tracing proposal? I don't know) and they suggest doing something for essential workers and customer facing, high volume roles (e.g. education workers, retail). What, however, that latter plan is I cannot say.  &gt;Create a dedicated agency, Te Korowai Kōkiri, to manage our Covid-19 response based in Manukau not Wellington;  I have often wondered if the larger part of the decision making around Covid settings in Auckland has been driven by people completely removed from life here in South Auckland, e.g. because they're in Wellington. However, I hate Wellington so #biased.  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** Basically, they say a Pandemic Response Agency is required... no argument from me... but they do not justify the location even though they're really specific about it. I should be clear that while Papakura's electoral borders are (a) huge and (b) enormously unstable [seriously, look at the maps, it's about as big as the rest of Auckland altogether], Manukau is not in Judith Collins' electorate so it's unlikely to be ""pork barrel"" politics. It's quite inexplicable though I do have a theory.  &gt;Build purpose-built quarantine;  Where? And why not state exactly where? Please don't be in Manukau...  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** Auckland Airport-ish. So... Manukau or Mangere (depending which direction you approach the Airport from, really).   I guess there's not too much difference between being a little isolated from Auckland as a whole and being a lot isolated from it. However, I would also say there isn't too much difference between being right in the middle of the CBD and drawing staff from all over Auckland, and being anywhere else in Auckland and drawing staff from all over Auckland. You have fewer avenues for a disease to escape quarantine but if it does (via staff), it's still loose and running in Auckland.  It's a tricky situation since you need to be somewhere that you can get people to and which already has some kind of proximity to a good location to have knowledge workers live. There is, I argue, a solution that mostly works. Connecting flights to Palmerston North. Not ideal, I admit, and a raw deal for Palmerston North if there is an outbreak... but it's got a university, which means there's a natural use for these units if there's no pandemic.  &gt;Launch a digital app for vaccination authentication;  I guess it's the best approach to a vaccine passport?  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** I guess that's their thinking also. Actually come to think of it... just create a vaccine ID number and use a registry.   &gt;Invest in next-generation Covid treatments  Again, with the needless aspirationism. I get that you can't necessarily embrace everything you want to do in a snappy phrase but why not ""Build and Operate a Contagious Disease Research Institute"", say?  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** Their problem is more or less to do with how Pharmac works. They could have just said that. It does appear that the standard operating model is too inflexible to deal with ""novel"" problems, but I prefer my idea (which isn't mutually exclusive, of course).  &gt;Prepare our hospitals and expand ICU capacity.  Unpopular opinion but I have generally found the ICU capacity arguments to lack the ""there's not enough capacity"" argument.   **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** I find the same problem here. However, the major purpose seems to be ""steal doctors and nurses from overseas"" but there's also stuff in there about ""let's not be dicks to the ones we've already acquired"" and ""let's make some more homegrown ones for the future"".  At this point, I return to the idea of Palmerston North. You see, there's a university there, as I said, so it just makes sense to me to try and make it a natural hub for all things contagious in country. If that requires another medical school, so be it. I imagine that would also have the effect of requiring building more ICU beds.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/pxg2jo/opening_up_national_announces_10_steps_to_prepare/henqkbc/

If OP is correct that we’ll plateau at 80%, the effort that will take to halve the remaining number of unvaccinated will become increasingly difficult and therefore increasingly the wrong thing to do.   It seems that in every country around the world so far increasingly strict vaccine mandates result in increasing unrest. Whether or not you disagree with the unrest doesn’t change the fact that it is damaging to society. Be it protests, riots, or truckers blocking highways, society will be disrupted and it will cause harm. Never mind the fact that logic tells us those protesting against vaccine mandates are not going to work or have resigned/been fired from work because they are unvaccinated.   The amount of money, effort, and time that I believe other countries have spent to not only create and decided upon mandates, but to implement and enforce them, is probably so extraordinary as to be more than what it would have cost to seriously increase icu capacity and support the healthcare system in other ways. Let alone those healthcare workers themselves who volunteered to continue to work all through last year without a vaccine and back when we really had no idea how dangerous this virus was. Yet they still trooped on. If the vaccine rate of healthcare works to the normal population is roughly the same then that is not an insignificant number of works who would be fired or resign.   So the incredibly steep and expensive uphill battle to try and raise the vaccine rate clearly comes with a huge amount of issues, but another thing worth considering is that it also represents diminishing returns. A vaccine passport for overseas travel seems obvious, and should be implemented, but anything more than that domestically will prove itself an expensive waste of time.  In any case it doesn’t appear as though the government has put any effort into bolstering the health care system since our first outbreak, so it doesn’t seem as though they would do it now. And if we open up the borders then obviously (like the rest of the world) covid will be 100* endemic. Because that’s only a matter of time, covid is already practically endemic.

Thankfully we are at a stage where it seems to be plateauing and hospitals aren’t yet overrun. Almost every death is an unvaccinated person, go figure 🤔  Lots of employers and other entities are requiring vaccines like universities, airlines and so on. Even many jobs at requiring it. We have also been using a passport system for non-essential places like restaurants and gyms for two weeks, and prior to its implementation there was a new surge in vaccine appointments.   I think what you guys have against you is that Covid hasn’t hit you hard. You haven’t seen a lot of deaths, dealt with restrictions and have been living mostly normally through this time. Personally I think this may make NZ more hesitant at first, but of course people will just need to accept the inevitable and get vaxxed.   In a weird way even though we haven’t handled things as well over here I think dealing with all the shit of the past year really made people see the value in the vaccine.

The case of some English guy in the 1950s springs to mind who was prosecuted for not showing his ID when requested by a policeman. He refused the request because the law was introduced during the war as a security measure to catch spies and since the war was long over, he questioned the relevance of the law since the war had ended some time ago.

We are also accepting that the rights of our citizens to return to NZ, as guaranteed on their passports, has been curtailed on the order of a government department functionary.  Also using the state of emergency to rush unrelated laws through parliament without the proper processes. More limitations of free speech to come. Anti terrorism legislation to come, sounds rushed through parliament, not much support from other parties. They've taken everyone's automatic and semi-automatic firearms from them which would have been required to mount any reasonable uprising/revolution against an authoritarian government.  Covid is going to be around for a while now, with new variants creating problems. It definitely seems like the government and Ministry of Health have given up on proper elimination i.e. 0 cases in the community. They're not interested in investing in proper quarantine facilities, they like to use leaky hotels so outbreaks keep happening, in our largest city even. They seem almost entirely clueless about efficacy of certain masks i.e. bandana 0%, cloth 0-30%, surgical 11%, double masking 60-90%, N95 respirator 95%, N99 respirator 99% etc. If they really wanted to eliminate community transmission they would mandate double masking or N95+ in public places to stop onward spread and stop more people being infected.  So since elimination is now impossible (because they let it in repeatedly and we're doing a half-arsed job of controlling it) I'm thinking they'll say we'll now be required to live with the emergency settings indefinitely, i.e. no level 1, permanent level 2+/3/4, scanning in everywhere you go, paying electronically (fully trackable), having Bluetooth tracing on so they know who you're in contact with, refusal to pass a law that will stop the tracing data being used by Police, SIS, GCSB etc, papers and negative testing to cross the border or leave Auckland.  Now they're talking about vaccine passports for local community use (not even international travel). I have a vaccination booklet with Yellow Fever in it which was required for a long time for international travel in some countries. Never have I heard before about a vaccine required to dine in a restaurant or visit the cinema etc. I am fully vaccinated but I know for a fact that the vaccine doesn't provide sterilising immunity. One vaccinated person with a breakthrough infection can go to the cinema, restaurant etc and spread it around via the air conditioning and give delta to many people there seeing that the vaccine is only 40% effective against getting infected. The viral load is the same so they'll then pass it on and so on. Having them vaccinated dampens the spread a little, but not a lot. The local vaccine passport requirements is almost useless in that regard. Better to have a rapid spit test before entry. This is another thing the government has no interest in doing, because they prefer the police state policies of scanning in and showing papers.  At the end of the day, once the freedoms are gone it will be almost impossible to get them back.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/pug772/is_anyone_else_getting_really_sick_of_the/he4wej6/

We actually need more tailored vaccines against delta and newer variants. The vaccines were developed for the original wild virus.  - A double vaccinated person has a ~61% chance of a breakthrough infection (vaccine is 39% effective against delta).  - A vaccinated person with breakthrough Covid can still spread the virus just like an unvaccinated and they have similar viral load. The vaccines don't prevent transmission here.  - Herd immunity with level 1 measures alone and relying on vaccines is looking almost impossible.  Basic numbers, even with some kind of vaccine passport for cinemas/indoor restaurants/nightclubs and 100 people in the cinema/restaurant/nightclub:  - Nobody is masked because the government tells them it's ""safe"" because everyone is vaccinated.  - A vaccinated person with a breakthrough infection enters and is breathing out virus into the same shared air environment over a period of 1-3 hours.  - You could expect 61 vaccinated people will get an infection, a bunch might be asymptomatic but some will have symptoms, 5 might get severe illness and need hospitalisation, then maybe a few die depending on healthcare availablity.

Given the number of people who can't get vaccinated, antivaxers make it hard to achieve effective heard immunity for covid. But from my experience (I've run into a few and had conversations, and have 2nd hand accounts of some), most antivaxers are sceptics, not crazies, and the social pressure from vaccine (or tests) to enter bars seems to swing most of them towards getting jabbed. Having something so obvious that has real effects on their life and widespread acceptance seems to enough to quash their doubt.  And even with a lot of bars not checking it at the door, when you go to events here the organisers will often check separately (eg: meetups), and just having people offering to show them when there's no checks seems to be enough.  For the record, we can sit outside at bars/cafes/whatever with no restrictions (still with contact tracing), but if we want to go inside we have to be vaccinated.

My idea for medium risk arrivals is this:   They need a vaccine passport and negative rapid tests before the flight and on arrival, then special quarantine taxis/ubers with the driver totally separated from passengers, to deliver them to self-isolation at home if they can be alone, or at quarantine airbnbs if they have family/flatmates at home. Then a PCR test on day 3-5.  Once clear they can leave quarantine, but agree to avoid any social gatherings over say 10 people, so no church or pub, and always wear a mask outside the house until they have another negative test on day 12 and clear day 14.

Yes, Covid vaccines do not provide sterile immunity so yes you can catch it and pass it on(much much less than an unvaccinated person) but all of them are still providing excellent protection against serious illness and hospitalization. Still, that is not relevant to what rights we have under existing laws to have a covid passport. 2. It doesn't need to. Again, have you been vaccinated or not.

1729,1001,1,1630586982,"&gt;What purpose do you see for a vaccine passport to enter a supermarket when a vaccinated person is perfectly capable of spreading the virus as well?  They are capable, but much, much less likely to spread it.  A fully vaccinated person is still 50-75% less likely to be infected.  Then even when infected their infectious period is much shorter and their milder symptoms make them less likely to infect others.  So their risk in far from zero, but still greatly, greatly reduced.    We can't take risks with vaccinated people now while we have a zero covid approach, because one case is too many.  But in a future mitigation or suppression environment vaccinated people can be treated as much less risky.    Secondly the purpose is specifically to make life inconvenient for the unvaccinated, to encourage them to get vaccinated.   &gt;You think preventing kids from 'antivax' homes from getting a normal education is a net win for society?  I think the number of truly antivax nuts who will actually go to the trouble of home schooling their children to avoid it is very, very small.  The number of vaccine hesitant or mildly antivax who will give in and get their kids vaxxed if that is the price of sending them to school is much higher.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/pggqca/new_caledonia_ponders_compulsory_covid19/hbb5tv6/

Mike's Minute: Could this lockdown have been avoided?   ON AIR   MIKE HOSKING BREAKFAST   AuthorMike Hosking, Publish DateWed, 18 Aug 2021, 9:54AM   So, let's be honest, as we said last week, this was always a race.    Did we get jabbed before the next case arrived or did Covid win? Well, Covid won.     We are not only where we don’t want to be, most importantly, we are where we don't need to be. Australia, and we have watched them increasingly nervously were, in the same boat.     Not enough vaccine and too much smugness.    The critical error was Scott Morrison saying it's not a race, when it was. Our lot made the same mistake based on the same level of arrogance and complacency. We don’t have Covid, so we can take all year to roll out a vaccine programme.    No, we can't.    Once Australia fell apart you knew the Government here was starting to panic. They had seen the Morrison sheen fall away, the blame game had started, the polls were sinking, and with it has come a massive economic bombshell as yet again billions get wiped off the bottom line.    We are where we are this morning because we have no other choice. But the critical part is we have no other choice because we dropped the ball, we failed to act in a way we needed to. Leadership was lacking. Urgency was lacking.    The answer was the answer so much of the world has got on with. Vaccines.    Vaccines are the passport to freedom. No, they are not a magic bullet, but they are the best we have. They are effective, they avoid the sort of lockdown and economic damage this country has favoured too many times now. They are better than where we are this morning.    And we could have been where others are.    Vaccination rates at a high and successful level allow cases in the community because vaccines mean you don’t die or end up on a ventilator. Vaccines aren't quite complete freedom, but they are more freedom than we have.    They provide more choice than we have. We shouldn’t be where we are.    But yet here we are again, 18 months on, same clumsy result. All of this in an era where we have better options.    Why don't we have better options? Because yet again the Government has failed to move, failed to fix, and failed to deliver.

A July 4th celebration in Provincetown has now resulted in nearly 900 cases of Covid, of which 74% were fully vaccinated.  And Pfizer and Israel have said a 3rd booster will be needed at 6 months.

I guess I'd agree with you in that there definitely isn't certainty one way or the other - this relates to my original comment that media commentators flippantly inferring everything will be 'one way' (ie ""back to normal"") as being poor form when there is a large amount of uncertainty and evidence that it might not be.    Also to clarify, what I've seen/heard is not that borders will be necessarily ""closed"" in 2023 (I mean they aren't even closed now) but that neither will they be ""open"".  Its far more nuanced than that eg a robust/recognized global vaccine passport is likely a couple of years away,  there are a lot of countries that wont have vaccinated their populations,  a lot of airlines/tourism operators/routes etc are simply gone, things that were 'feasible' before wont be anymore in the post-covid world due to numbers, all kinds of insurances including personal (travel/health) and corporate (event, health &amp; safety etc) have changed which is huge, health and safety considerations themselves have changed, appetites for and perceptions around risk have changed.

Currently you have countries duking it out in a bidding war over half a dozen different vaccines with a bunch more companies doing the actual manufacturing. Adding in extra variables like production supply chain, storage conditions, and multiple doses makes traceability very difficult. If you have a digital vaccine passport, that would need to be hosted on a central server by a central entity containing vaccine records for billions of people globally (and would need constant updating for boosters in the years to come). So who does that - the WHO, the IATA? Do they create different versions that are accepted in some parts of the world but not others? The cost to run such a system would be immense. The most feasible way to do it is using blockchain tech, but that's not at the mass adoption level yet where it would be quick or easy to develop.

1778,1050,0,1619976447,"Continued: Back to Fauci, his wife is on the board of directors of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, who is being sued by the African nation Kenya, because the tetanus vaccines distributed there in 2014 through GAVI (gates created and controlled) rendered all of the women infertile because of the presence of HCG antigen.  Now it has come to light that 97% of people admitted to the ICU with COVID are simply vitamin D deficient. Gates proposed to block out the sun with atmospheric aerosols to combat global warming. Gates father was a renowned Eugenicist, a signatory to the Eugenic society. Klaus Schwab, Gates, the Rockefellers, Kissinger and other .01% economic ""elite"" meet every year in Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum. You know what the problem is? Human overpopulation. What better way to get in front of both the global economic collapse that was to occur in 2020 due to fiscal stimulus / money printing and a collapsing dollar and the human population bottleneck than with a fake pandemic.  Exactly zero of the information here is infactual. You have been thoroughly, completely bamboozled.  The crux of the matter is that this entire ""pandemic"" is based on the PCR test at 50 amplification cycles, and scientists, epidemiologists the world over were calling this out very early on. Anything above 25-30 cycles results in a huge false positive rate (97% @ 50 cycles!). The day of Biden's inauguration (I voted for Jill Stein last time around, Corporate Left = Corporate Right, I don't like Trump nor Biden, but they managed to politicize it so that if you call out the Fake Pandemic youre a ""Trump supporter"") the WHO announced that 50 cycles was too high and, and I'm not kidding here, ""all of the tests from 2020 need to be ""redone"". Yes that's correct. The justification for the lockdowns, the ""pandemic"" was all based on PCR test at 50 amplification cycles and now the day of Biden's inauguration the WHO comes out and announces that the tests need to be redone. Can you fucking undo the lockdowns? Does anyone know that more people committed suicide in Japan in the month of November 2020 than died from COVID 19 for the entire year, direct consequence of the lockdowns? Do you understand that childhood suicide is on the rise? Youre going to tell kids to stay at home and their only form of interaction with other children and the world at large is through a fucking ipad? We are DESTROYING these children for something with a 99.97% rate of survival! In fact under 50 the IFR for seasonal flu is higher than SARS-CoV-2! 6 feet? Why not 7 or 8? It's an arbitrary figure that has no backing from ANY science! You can enter a restaurant ""you must wear your mask to enter"" and then when you sit down you take the fucking mask off and no-one questions the logic or rationale for the masks? Bacterial pneumonia is on the rise because not only do these fabric masks not keep out 7nm virus but paper is a medium for bacterial growth. Sweden never did the lockdown, the social distancing nor the mask mandate, want to guess how many people died in Oct 2020 from COVID out of a population of 10 million? 55. Texas lifts the lockdown and cases plummet (sunlight, vitamin D and exercise best medicine against influenza virus family). ""Stay at home out of sunlight with your mask on"" they are driving sickness with these policies, on top of the emotional distress and negative social interaction. ""Deaths are up year over year"". Mortality from all causes goes up big time during economic recession.   There is ZERO science supporting the masks, social distancing, nor the lockdowns and these aren't vaccines. They have an agenda. Again, global economy was going to collapse and we do have a human overpopulation problem (not simply overpopulation, more so overconsumption, with China and India poised to attain the level of consumption of a 1st worlder, the planet cannot support this, at present, with only the Anglosphere consuming the energy equivalent of 23 Bangladeshi's, not to mention water (1 pint of Almond Milk = 1600 gallons of embodied water) we need 5 planet Earth's of resources to sustain this level of consumption. The 1 billion that they will keep around after the ""Great Pandemic"" via mRNA vaccines will only be because biological robots are a higher level of robot that can go into the Tesla Truck factory and change a fuse now and then. The 1 billion remaining will be chipped and heavily monitored via 5G + implant interface. If they need to reduce a certain demographic, say there are too many Hispanic people, they will custom taylor the ""top up"" annual vaccines (Pfizer has already announced that a 3rd shot is necessary and that you will need a new one every year, ""kaching kaching"" cash register sound) to delete a number of ""excess"" certain ethnicity or sex or age or whatever.   Here's how they will depopulate, what we see with these mRNA vaccines is a phenomenon called ADE (Antibody Dependent Enhancement) / Pathogenic Priming. A study done on ferrets and then reproduced on non-human primates showed 100% rate of mortality when specimens were given these biologics / gene therapy (they aren't vaccines, they are calling them that so they can remain indemnified under 1986 Childhood Vaccine Injury Act) they all died when exposed to the actual wild variant of the virus later on. Given the difference in body mass and metabolism, as Dr. Schmidt points out, this may take more than one flu season, or maybe not.  Here's my prediction, vulnerable people who blindly rolled up their sleeves for these ""vaccines"" will be dying this or the next upcoming flu season en masse, they will call it ""The Dark Winter"" and Big Pharma owned media and politicians (Cuomo, Newsom) will spin it and claim that the reason why we are having a Dark Winter is because we didn't attain ""herd immunity"" because of vaccine hesitancy. At that point in time they will introduce legislation mandating compulsory vaccination for all adults because of the ""emergency"". They will not come to your doorstep. They will ensure compliance by way of a vaccine passport, at first app based, but then they will introduce implantable RFID chips (more advanced, can communicate with body endocrinology, via 5G, which no-one wants, nor needs (5G is 2.4 GHz millimeter wave EMF, the same freq as U.S. Army active denial system, same tech the Russians were working on in the 1980's, ""psychotronic"" weaponry. 5G @ 100m distance is EMF equivalent of holding a phone directly to your head but about your entire body, 24/7, and they want to put a 5G antenna on every street corner, literally. FCC has been captured by the telecoms just as the FDA and CDC have been captured by Big Pharma and you cannot refuse the installation of this technology, nor are any health and safety studies required).  Anyhow, youre being lied to, we have a problem here on planet earth of too many stupid people, as evidenced by the morons upvoting nonsense ""it's FDA approved!"" here in this thread, and the elites, who can and will replace you with automation systems, intend to bring your numbers down to under 1 billion by 2030 by way of ADE / Pathogenic Priming via 100% vaccination.  They are calling it The Great Reset / Agenda 2030.  Nothing, I repeat, NOTHING stated here is infactual, but you won't ever ascertain that for yourselves because youre so fucking brainwashed.
