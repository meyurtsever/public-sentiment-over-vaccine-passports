You will also need your school records.   &gt;Am I missing anything?  You need employment and money.  &gt;How much money would I need for atleast 6 months? I know how much rent, electricity and Water would cost. I do Not Accurately know how much food would cost per month. For me It seems like 10-15k, is this close to yours?  Consider your rent for a room, depends on the location (safety of the place). If you are planning for 6 months, you will need roughly  80k for a quite comfortable life.  &gt;Is there anyway to fake my age or identity?  There is a way but that is jail time. **You definitely would not like jail time.**  If you just need some time out of your household, find a friend or a relative to stay at for the moment to change your environment. If you plan to go fully independent, then make sure to at least have people to fall back to when things go sour. Be careful of predators too.

1,1,1,1642036885,"&gt;What someone like me need to be able to live away from. My parents? What IDs? I have my Passport birth Certificate And my COVID Vaccination Card  You're gonna need more than just IDs to live away from your parents. You're going to need a job.  &gt;How much money would I need for atleast 6 months? I know how much rent, electricity and Water would cost. I do Not Accurately know how much food would cost per month. For me It seems like 10-15k, is this close to yours?  The money you would need depends on what kind of lodging and lifestyle you'll have. 10 - 15K for six months is too low. If you're used to having comfortable lodgings, it's going to be 10k a month. If you bed-space instead, you can save money, but you'll potentially be spending 7 to 8k a month anyway.   &gt;Also I may decide to leave as soon as 18 but COVID may ramp up again and they may decide only 21+ can go buy groceries. Is there anyway to fake my age or identity?  They don't check the age in both the vaccine and quarantine passes, so I don't think you should go making fake documents or identities which is a crime. If ever they do restrict people below 21, you can always reason that you're living alone.",Philippines,t5_2qjov,/r/Philippines/comments/s1ydg8/need_to_leave_toxic_household/hsfes0z/

And now the mayors want the unvaccinated banned from going to restaurants, malls, groceries. I'm pretty sure those who did not get the boosters will be considered ""unvaccinated"" in the future. Fck Isko moreno and all these mayors.  I didnt get the vaccination because i already had covid back in March of 2021. There's this thing called ""natural immunity"". It was unneccessary for me to get the jab, and i never had the virus again after getting sick with it. But I finally decided to get the vaccine after they announced a ""lockdown for the unvaccinated"".   But this vaccine mandate/passport that the govt officials are forcing upon us is too much. This will backfire bigly for those (isko moreno) who favored this and this will wreck our economy for sure. Booster shots 3 to 4 times a year for new variants, long lines at the crack of dawn, businesses having only half the customers it usually gets because of the mandates, good luck with that.

7,7,0,1640330678,"Probably Manuel Quezon. He laid the foundation of our country.   He approved Filipino as the national language, Created national council of education which advices the government on educational policies and reforms and to upgrade public schools all across philippines.   He initiated the womens suffrage (Made it possible for women to vote).  He established the Department of National Defense.  He created Agriculture and Commerce (Which later became Department of Agriculture)  He reorganized/Created Health and Public welfare (DOH) and tackled Tuberculosis, Malaria, Malnutrition, Leprosy etc.   He appointed first all filipino Supreme Court in 1935.   He fought for the passage of the Tydings-McDuffie Act. (Philippine Independence)   Not including his works on improving bureaucracy, Mindanao development, Foreign trade and commerce, and Corruption reforms  He did all of that while USA is grabbing the country by the balls. And not to mention the invasion of Japanese.   For me He is the best president of the Philippines.    2. Sergio Osmeña Sr.   Rebuilt Post-War Philippines, Bell trade act. Considering the country was practically fucked and on fire at the time, He contributed a lot to rebuilding it.   3. Ramon Magsaysay    Defeated Hukbalahap, Made our country a member of Southeast asia treaty organization (Asean), Made NARRA, Philippines was at a golden age where corruption is not rampant.   4. Carlos P. Garcia for his cultural revival and filipino muna policy.   5. Diosdado Macapagal   Placed the Philippine Peso on the free currency exchange and pushed for exports, Minimum wage law, Philippines veterans bank, Land reform Law.  Basically Economy fixing.   6. Elpidio Quirino   National Security Council, created integrity board. notable postwar reconstruction, general economic gains and increased economic aid from the United States and Social Security services (SSS)    6. Jose Laurel   He did the best he could do during the Japanese occupation. Contributions to educational reforms and a true advocate for Justice. He was involved in making the constitution which included the Bill of Rights of the 1935 Constitution, which was the so-called Seven Wise Men of the Convention. He was the senator of the Third Republic and the author of Rizal Law, and at the same time was the negotiator of the Laurel –Langley Trade agreement.   7. Manuel Roxas   Bell trade act (Exports are Tariff free) and the push for Tydinfs-Mcduffie act. And basically national reconstruction post war.   8. Fidel V. Ramos  He was alright. He did what he could during post marcos fuckery. His policies alleviated the drowning economy. And the implementation of comprehensive social reform agenda. Reached out for peace talks with muslim insurgents and NPA. MRT line 3 and LRT line 2.  Best dude to have at one of the shittiest time.   9. Benigno Aquino III  K to 12 program, Economic Growth, gave insensitive for BPO companies which created thousands of Jobs for undergraduate Filipino, Hague Ruling against China (A Bold fucking move, Too bad Obama is a fucking asshole) peace agreement with MILF.   11. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo  A classic case of ""You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain""  Her works as a Senator was fucking outstanding. Too bad she went corrupt.   She's an Economist and a good one at that. Initiated the Strong republic transit system. Pulled out of Iraq after the kidnapping of filipino truck driver. She was criticized but she did the right thing.   Philippines-Japan trade deal.   But the bitch went coo coo. Corruptions here. Corruptions there. Controversy here. Controversy there.   Its too bad. Shes a wasted potential.   12. Cory Aquino  1987 constitution.   Honestly I dont know much about her presidency but I do know it wasn't that good. She did the best she could when the economy is so fucked thanks to one fucking Ube looking motherfucker.   She alleviate the fucked economy I guess and strengthen international bonds.   13. Rodrigo Duterte  I like his works on infrastructure. Increasing salary of military and police. Passport act. Strengthen the Anti deposit law.  New clark city, major rehabilitation of Boracay and Cleaning of Manila bay (Didn't like the dolomite beach) excited for the subway system.   He made significant improvements on crimes but this time the policemen became the criminal. Controversy here, controversy there. Murder here, murder there.   And his covid 19 pandemic handling is..... Very fucking underwhelming. Roque, Duque and the fucking pardoning of Pemberton. That was fucking disgusting.   Not to mention his foreign policy on china. What a shit show.   His works on infrastructure is fucking good. But everything else is golden dogshit.   14. Emilio Aguinaldo   He is busy dealing with Spaniards and Americans that he didnt really do anything significant. He fought for our independence I guess.   15. Ferdinand Marcos  Same as Duterte. Good on infrastructure and shit on everything else. I fucking hate this man. When i look at my taxes I am very fucking angered that I am paying for Imelda's shoes collection.   He fucked the economy of our nation and I can't believe people still thinks this dick is the best one. Quezon must be so fucking disappointed.   Overall a shit president. Corrupt and a fucking massive dickhead.   16. Joseph Estrada (Erap)   I can't seem to fathom how this guy ever won. What went through peoples mind in 1998. How did this fucking testicle looking mf with glasses on manage to woo the entire nation?!    So TL DR, Quezon best, Erap worst.

It's a question between giving up a certain degree of autonomy and self governance vs. Public health safety. It is up to assessors to determine the pros and cons.  I personally dont agree with a blanket vaccine passport/ vaccination mandate but I guess can be balanced by applying incentives. Such as making it a requirement for participation in COVID hotspot activities. I also think that asking for higher insurance premiums for unvaccinated individuals is better, albeit more complicated than a federal wide vaccine mandate.

You can teach in universities without a LET as long as you have qualifying experience and post graduate degrees (I know, I teach in one). Similarly, private school teaching for high school also doesn't require LET (I taught for senior high as well, part-time).  If you want to teach in public schools, you need to pass the licensure exam. However, prep yourself for low pay and poor benefits. Add to that, the teaching ratio is usually one teacher to 60 students. Materials are incomplete, with no books, chairs, or other stuff. Most of the time, you have to prep out of pocket.  Prepare yourself for a major downgrade teaching in the Philippines.

37,37,0,1626080425,"The EU's ""Digital COVID Certificate"", which is colloquially referred to as the EU's ""vaccine passport"" is a one-pager document that's supposed to make it easy for people to travel through and across the Schengen region by having a singularly-recognized, uniform declaration of a person's vaccination status.  It's this thing that supposedly only recognizes Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and AstraZeneca (specifically, the Western-manufactured version of AZ, and not the licensed versions of AZ from India, South Korea, or Thailand).  The ""rumor"" about Sinovac (and other vaccines) is based on how the Digital COVID Certificate has not yet been uniformly implemented across all EU countries, and __the EU has given its member states individual discretion on recognizing/allowing vaccines that the European Medicines Agency has not yet approved__.  For example: https://www.dw.com/en/which-eu-countries-accept-vaccinated-travelers/a-57808870  &gt; **People entering Spain** from what it deems ""risk"" areas — including many EU members and most other countries in the world — **can avoid quarantine requirements by showing proof of full vaccination with a jab approved by** the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or **the World Health Organization (WHO) at least 14 days before arriving**, proof of recovery from COVID-19, or a negative test.  [and noting here that Sinovac is included within this classification of vaccines approved by the WHO, even if it is not (yet) approved by the EMA]  &gt; **The Greek government** lists the following vaccines among those accepted: Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax, Johnson and Johnson, **Sinovac**, Sputnik V, Casino Biologics, and Sinopharm.  In contrast:  &gt; France recognizes all vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency and considers travelers fully vaccinated two weeks after their final dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or AstraZeneca jabs, and four weeks after the single shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.  So given that France specifically does not recognize vaccines that are (only) approved by the WHO, and also does not specifically name Sinovac, then presumably a person vaccinated with Sinovac might not be able to enter France (without an urgent need/without undergoing quarantine), even if they might be able to enter Greece or Spain.  Or as another example:  &gt; However, fully vaccinated passengers with valid vaccination certificates are entirely exempt, no matter the color code of the country they come from. **Cyprus accepts all vaccines approved for use in the EU as well as the Sputnik V and Sinopharm shots**.  This means that Sino**vac** specifically would not count for Cyprus, even if Sino**pharm** does.  If you actually were going to plan a trip to Europe, and you were vaccinated with Sinovac (or Sinopharm, as in the case of the San Juan), you'd basically have to check on a per-country basis.

39,39,0,1624666381,"See below.   &gt;I am technically homeless. I have a car and a job. I live in USA. I have never traveled outside the USA before. I have no family or friends in the USA - This is NOT an exaggeration. I could get an apartment, but I just feel it would be pointless unless it's required for a passport - read below about that.  You choose to be homeless. That is your fault. You failed. How does one not have friends or family? Sounds like you have anti-societal problems. You failed.   &gt;I would like to travel to Philippines. I seem to like the people there more. They don't seem to have as much drugs or alcohol or smoking or random sex or vulgarity as much as America. I hate the USA because everyone I meet does ""Weed"", gets drunk and high, or smokes, takes pride in having sex with random people, have immense ego and entitlement, employees give the worst and unprofessional experience,band I just don't like people in the USA.  You know nothing about the PHILIPPINES probably other than Filipinas who will love you long time. Stop reading those SEX PAT blogs.   DRUGS are prevalent in the PHILIPPINES also and nothing more different than the States. If you tried to make some minimal effort, you can read about all the drug-related news. Like drinking doesn't exist here? It does. Everything you hate in the States exists in the PHILIPPINES as well. Think of the Philippines as little America. Your ideas of paradise is incorrect and your sources are wrong.   The people you despise there is your fault b/c you choose to not associate with other people in the States. These people you despise also exist here in the PHILIPPINES.   &gt;I also like how people in Philippines seems to be nice, respectful, Family Oriented, and dress with dignity in a professional manner.  Yes but not for you. Chances are if you dont like people in the states and you feel like everyone has done you wrong it will be more prevalent here especially when you dont know the language.   &gt;I don't have a Passport yet. I have all the documents needed to get a passport but it would be for my old address that I no longer live at. I have already checked and know I can get one with the documents I have... But I don't know if that would be an issue because a passport last for many years, and I won't always be able to verify an old address I don't live at anymore...  BOOHOO. Cry me a river. If you had a permanent home then this wouldn't be an issue. Again that's your fault for living out of a car.   &gt;I don't have the Covid Vaccine because I think Covid is a overhyped propaganda piece, but I would be willing to get a vaccine to travel, otherwise I won't in America. I'll even wear a mask as mandatory even though I never wear one in the USA.  See previous post, but you are a COVID denier. You drank the q-anon Trump koolaid. This in itself speaks how stupid you and your kind are. COVID is real and i hope you get COVID so it proves how wrong you are.    &gt;I know the USA has a lot of Freedom and Money but I don't like the people here. They have taken that Freedom and act like brats and taken the Money and act entitled.  Again. you are one of those trumpers who think all your freedoms are taken away...life's not fair. Waaah waaah. You will have less freedoms in the PHILIPPINES as a foreigner.    &gt;Because I do NOT know: What are important laws or customs I will have to abide by in Philippines?  A simple search online will do. No one's going to spoon feed you.   &gt;I also don't know if there are any specific requirements needed like additional vaccination for other things or if the address on the passport has to be my new apartment if I get one.  So you are willing to bend the rules travel? Either you are anti-vax or willing to vax? Pick a side.   &gt;If I have to have a new address: How can I choose an apartment or a home that will allow a foreigner if I ever decide to bring someone to America to get married?  Again see previous posts. You are a prime target to be taken advantage of.    &gt;Is there any advice you can provide me?  Yes DO NOT GO. You are a loser in the states and you will be a loser here.

Roundtrip economy fares from Manila to Europe are around $800 (pre-COVID), visa fees around $100, travel insurance around $30, traveler’s tax around $35, pocket money and accommodations depends on the lifestyle, of course, but some travel blogs will give your friend a rough idea of how much the consulate is expecting to see in your friend’s bank account to supplement his/her travel. While I can sense your excitement in hosting your friend, that’s easily $1000 at least, and only she can say whether she can actually afford that.   If your friend has traveled to other places (not a blank passport), or has visas (expired or current) to the US, Japan, Canada, etc. that will help a lot.  Aside from the documents listed in the checklist, I’d also recommend your friend to provide an employment certificate from his/her employer and a letter granting him/her leave of absence, both good to have onhand if the consulate asks. It’s a great way to prove that she has a job to come back to especially if she’s been working in that company for quite some time now, and shows that she has her employer’s consent for her vacation. Best to travel with these documents as proof too, just in case Immigration asks.   Before the appointment itself, ask your friend to rehearse and make sure that he/she knows how to answer politely and succinctly. Common questions are “How long will you be staying?” and “Purpose of travel?” but it’s not unheard of for them to ask “Are you paying for your own trip? Who is helping you pay? What is your relationship? Are you going to work there? Why is your employer allowing you to go on a break this long?”  It’s better to overprepare than to underprepare. Have photocopies of everything, bring a pen and glue, get there on time, and be polite to EVERYONE. Only answer when prompted. Do not overshare because that will only lead to more questions.   In some cases, they may grant a visa but also indicate via stamp that you will have to go back to the local consulate office once you return from your trip just to make sure that you actually returned from the trip. It’s not a big deal; just show up and get stamped.

Hot showers, cable TV, air conditioning, far from the small bed space room, cold early morning daily showers  and good company  1. a certain girl, forgot her name,  the first one, with a nice pair, firm and upright, later did I know, was a MILF, due to the horizontal cesarian section scar  2. ""AJ"" , those in the know,  know her, with this alias, it was kinda memorable for her love of all Hello Kitty merchandise, though the experience was so-so, was rushed, and you'll she just does it for the money  3. ""Krista"" , don't recall her alias, but she looked like Krista Ranillo. I think she was 24 or 25 at that time  When we went out the first time, the deal , as told by the ""handler"" was  ""3 hours / 2pops"" (as always) , I am not to brag, would just want to say it as it is, we have already done 3 pops, and it's 10 minutes past the 3 hours, but ""Krista"" would still want to go on, saying I'm biggest she had, and it would seem I was pleasuring her more that she does me.  so I get her number, cut middleman, so we did  ""Krista"" works in an office, or so she says, having this as just a side line, to fund her eventual plan to work over seas.  a box of condoms would have 3, but we're about to do round 4. and she still wants more. but she would have to ""remit"" the share to the ""handler"". She has to go. I slept the night, left the next day, to another mundane 2 weeks.    We meet again after 2 weeks, same hotel, 24 hour room.  she does regular check-up (i know this is true, she's got the paper with her, even saw her real name, how do I know it's her real name? she just got the passport she needs for her OFW work, so just trust me on this, ok) , and so am I , quarterly, and free anytime with the health card, so were clean. She also was always had been doing it with condoms, being me the exception.  she was having fun, but at the same time, perhaps that sense of security she has with me, that she knows I was just practicing my bedside manners, and her , eventually just having fun, while being single as well.  she stayed for 6 hours, we did 5 times , bareback, always cautious not to pop in , but just over.  always small talk in between, somehow we were doing it like we were in a relationship, with passion, with care, kisses being with emotion, but always not crossing the line we both knew we drew.    another 2 weeks past.  She messaged me ahead if she can ""bring"" a ""friend"" along.  ""friend"" was in need so had to tag along, i recall having to sell a spare Samsung phone for this adventure just for this extra. Not that I was going broke, but i would always spend only what I have extra, after all essentials are covered.  this was a menage-atrois  a milestone for me.  turns out ""friend"" was unremarkable, morena, but no skills, the experience forgettable, and of course I wore protection, i did her friend first, Krista being a non participant, after were done doing it once, friend says she has to go, perhaps she was just in need.  so Krista and I just spent the afternoon, much like we did before.   *****  for the life of me, I never kept numbers written down, I lost my phone, i dont even remember how or what phone was it, I never had contact with Krista again, Facebook was just rising back then, and free data was not even something, people still have to rent PCs just to check their accounts.   but the website was still there.   4. ""Abby""  ""Abby"", if you being a patron of the same website, would know her, her 'alias' was not even a made up one. And how can you not forget?  A petite, 4'11 or 5'1 ish girl with 40Ds  i even find it too good to be true in the pictures, even before when I hear the doorbell rang, I was already excited I can hear my heart pound over the hum of the air conditioning of that room in Cubao, and the occasional noise of MRT passing by.  then the phone rang, okay, send her up.  I was already at the door, looking through the peephole, doorbell rang, and what I see is way more than my expectations.  I let her in the room  with usual awkward greeting, i saw her underneath the smile were braces.  her hair was in a ponytail, she was wearing pants, a decent dress with a blazer, but you would know the looks of people that she may have come across, definitely, she may had a lot of those.  her eyes were pretty, but I know you wont be looking up right away.  small talk, how hot was the weather, and she had to walk from Farmers Cubao just to get here, she was kind but you will know she wont take your BS, somehow we got along with our sense of humor on what was on the TV,   she was still sweating even with the AC on max, I already did showered ahead, as she already knew when she touched my hair, while we were kissing, so di na sya naka tiis, she wants to go ahead and shower. ""Can I go with you?"" , she laughed with a ""No"", took 1 towel and went.  it was 15 minutes past, and I thought it's gonna take long.   she opens the bathroom door, it was still steaming with the hot water shower running, she was relieved with it, she has the towel of her hair drying it off.  The younger me will forever hold that sight, etched in the back of my mind.   a body of a Venus, smooth, and white as the only white light in the room they were naturals, they were perfect, they defy gravity, 40D, and I would say she was not curvy at all, that waistline, those hips, it's just unbelievable.  It was hard as diamonds.  You can only, and will only imagine what a pair of smooth, soft surfaces can do to a pillar of straight up 1 month of no nut, plus the caresses and fingers that I use to play with guitar chords on John Mayer songs  Got the extra thins, and put in on.  she let out a gasp, a 'tangina' and commented on the size, again, I am saying this as I was told, and after 2 women telling me, I am bound to believe it.  she was struggling in missionary, often trying to crawl up, but not in pain, I would know by now if it's faked, but we do, the more it slides and gets lubrication.  she ask is she can have more top control, I obliged, and I was drowning with the view, i swear there was a time I cant breathe right i have to ask her to back away a bit, she did , but still won't stop , she was getting it more than I do. then we switched positions.  On fours, she says she was getting tired and says she already had multiples and ask if ""matagal ka pa ba""  yes, think so , like I always do when wearing it.  she asks to take it off, it the heat of the moment so I did.  it slided in with much more tightness an grip , the kind I had not experienced with priors, sliding perfectly like a well oil piston, moist as rain.   asking me to be careful that it not go off inside.  and off it goes, pulling out at the right moment.  had a rest, I was already drinking my 2nd can of RH, we did seconds , she ask me not to put one on, cause she liked it that way, i dont recall all the details due to the horses kicking in, but there were alot of positions involved.  She says she has a boyfriend at that time, but he didn't have what I have, also reassured me, the handler gets them tested.  so am I , cause I can get it free.  she was kinda hurrying after the 2nd, cause the handler was already texting her while we do it, she says this guy is always in a bad mood when there was no updates after the 3 hour deed. I didn't notice we were already 30 mins overtime.  She left as fast as she arrived, a kiss on the lips, and phone number saved in my new phone.  *****  we were supposed to meet again, cutting the middle man prices, but schedule conflict, never pushed through, and her number being lost and suddenly, we just lost contact, I know her real Facebook account, but that is one thing I say to myself not contact her there  *****  I hear she is living fine now, with a kid, as of 2020, already left the past behind, I'm actually happy for her, she somehow maintained the figure, a bit of curves but in the right places.   *****  It was a bit risky in hindsight, but that was 2009, we were both safe , and I am safe as of today, though I've already retired this way of life, and I am not advocating not being safe when doing it, this is just a retelling of what happened.  more to come next time",Philippines,t5_2qjov,/r/Philippines/comments/leug9r/sex_lies_and_redemption_my_recollections10_years/gngza25/

60,5,1,1642690723,"&gt; MANILA- Public Attorney's Office (PAO) chief Persida Acosta hit back at Senator Franklin Drilon on Thursday after he said she should be barred from going to work physically due to not being vaccinated against COVID-19.   Acosta said that Drilon should not attack her personally, but instead go after Republic Act 11525, or the COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021.   Unvaccinated PAO chief must be barred from attending work in-person: Drilon According to Acosta, the law acknowledged the experimental nature of COVID-19 vaccines, mandated the creation of a national vaccine indemnity fund, and rendered vaccinators and vaccine manufacturers immune from suit and liability.   She said that under the law, vaccine cards should not be considered an additional mandatory requirement for educational, employment, and other similar government transactions.   ""Provided further that the vaccine cards shall not be considered as an additional mandatory requirement for educational, employment and other similar government transaction. Walang mandatory vaccination,"" Acosta said. ""Batas ho ito eh. Republic Act 11525. Bakit ako po ang kanilang pinepersonal? Eh di atakihin nila ‘tong batas na ito.""  (There is no mandatory vaccination. This is law. Republic Act 11525. Why am I being attacked personally? They should attack this law.)   ""Eh Kongreso po ang gumawa nitong Republic Act 11525? Hindi naman ako. Wala akong pirma dito.""  (Congress came up with Republic Act 11525, not me. I didn't sign it.)   She said it was up to a person whether they should get vaccinated against COVID-19. She also said that vaccines were still under Emergency Use Authorization, and that they should be given a Certificate of Product Registration (CPR) first before they are made mandatory.   ""Pwedeng i-mandatory vaccination, kung may CPR na ‘yan at proven na walang namamatay, walang nai-incapacitate, walang natatak, walang nagma-myocarditis, kahit sinasabi ng mga gumawa ng bakuna na ‘yan ang side effect. Eh kung wala, bigyan ng CPR,"" she said.   (You can do mandatory vaccinations if the vaccine has a CPR and it's proven that nobody will die from it, nobody gets incapacitated, nobody gets myocarditis, even if the vaccine makers said these are the side effects. If the vaccine doesn't have any of these, then give it a CPR.)   Acosta accused Drilon of not following the issue she initially raised, which was the supposed unconstitutionality of government's ""no vax, no ride"" policy.   ""Eh 50 million pa yung hindi nababakunahan eh? Eh di lahat ng hindi bakunado, hindi niya papasukin? Anong mangyayari ‘dun?"" the PAO chief said. ""Eh hindi niya sinusundan yung logic ng issue, dapat may major premise, minor premise, tsaka conclusion. Kung puro minor premise lang, ay walang katuturan yung conclusion na wag nang papasukin si Persida Acosta.""  (50 million Filipinos aren't vaccinated yet. So if they're unvaccinated, he wouldn't allow them to go to work? What will happen then? He's not following the logic of the issue. There should be a major premise, minor premise, then the conclusion. If it's all just minor premises, then the conclusion that Persida Acosta should not be allowed to go to work is worthless.)   But Acosta also said that she bore no ill-will toward Drilon.   ""Wala po akong masamang tinapay kay Sir Frank. Mahal na mahal ko po ‘yan kaya kahit na binabanatan niya ako parang siguro ‘di ko alam bakit galit sa akin ‘to eh binoto naman namin siya,"" she said.   (I don't have any grudges toward Sir Frank. I love him very much even though he's hitting me like this. It's like I don't know why he's so mad at me, even though we voted for him.)   Drilon said earlier on Thursday that Acosta should get vaccinated against COVID-19 since she was a government official. He warned that her not doing so could result in credibility issues for Manila's vaccination campaign.   The Senate minority leader added that he was ""open for a debate"" on a mandatory vaccination policy.   Health Secretary Francisco Duque III also urged Acosta to get the jab, saying that she was almost a senior citizen and should get extra protection against COVID-19.   The PAO chief earlier said that she was waiting for what she called a ""protein-based"" COVID-19 vaccine.",Philippines,t5_2qjov,/r/Philippines/comments/s8ktsp/unvaccinated_acosta_blasts_drilon_over_call_to/htgqn5t/

The ""rumor"" about Sinovac (and other vaccines) is based on how the Digital COVID Certificate has not yet been uniformly implemented across all EU countries, and __the EU has given its member states individual discretion on recognizing/allowing vaccines that the European Medicines Agency has not yet approved__.  For example: https://www.dw.com/en/which-eu-countries-accept-vaccinated-travelers/a-57808870  &gt; **People entering Spain** from what it deems ""risk"" areas — including many EU members and most other countries in the world — **can avoid quarantine requirements by showing proof of full vaccination with a jab approved by** the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or **the World Health Organization (WHO) at least 14 days before arriving**, proof of recovery from COVID-19, or a negative test.  [and noting here that Sinovac is included within this classification of vaccines approved by the WHO, even if it is not (yet) approved by the EMA]  &gt; **The Greek government** lists the following vaccines among those accepted: Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax, Johnson and Johnson, **Sinovac**, Sputnik V, Casino Biologics, and Sinopharm.  In contrast:  &gt; France recognizes all vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency and considers travelers fully vaccinated two weeks after their final dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or AstraZeneca jabs, and four weeks after the single shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.  So given that France specifically does not recognize vaccines that are (only) approved by the WHO, and also does not specifically name Sinovac, then presumably a person vaccinated with Sinovac might not be able to enter France (without an urgent need/without undergoing quarantine), even if they might be able to enter Greece or Spain.  Or as another example:  &gt; However, fully vaccinated passengers with valid vaccination certificates are entirely exempt, no matter the color code of the country they come from. **Cyprus accepts all vaccines approved for use in the EU as well as the Sputnik V and Sinopharm shots**.  This means that Sino**vac** specifically would not count for Cyprus, even if Sino**pharm** does.  If you actually were going to plan a trip to Europe, and you were vaccinated with Sinovac (or Sinopharm, as in the case of the San Juan), you'd basically have to check on a per-country basis.

And in my experience, the people in the vaccination center didn’t even ask for my certificate or prescription, they just took my word for it that I had a comorbidity and the questions they asked me were more to make sure I had no conditions that would cause adverse reactions to the vaccine. Of course, it’s still good to have the medical certificate or prescription on hand.   And at this point, I think they’re more worried about vaccines expiring than making sure that only A1-A3 get vaccinated first. I was really worried about making sure I really have a comorbidity and that I’m not skipping the line, but it seems the attitude at the vaccination centers is to just get as many people vaccinated as possible. If you have an appointment and proof of residence, I don’t think they’ll turn you away.   To be honest I can’t blame them what with the vaccine hesitancy problem.

148,30,0,1626080425,"The EU's ""Digital COVID Certificate"", which is colloquially referred to as the EU's ""vaccine passport"" is a one-pager document that's supposed to make it easy for people to travel through and across the Schengen region by having a singularly-recognized, uniform declaration of a person's vaccination status.  It's this thing that supposedly only recognizes Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and AstraZeneca (specifically, the Western-manufactured version of AZ, and not the licensed versions of AZ from India, South Korea, or Thailand).  The ""rumor"" about Sinovac (and other vaccines) is based on how the Digital COVID Certificate has not yet been uniformly implemented across all EU countries, and __the EU has given its member states individual discretion on recognizing/allowing vaccines that the European Medicines Agency has not yet approved__.  For example: https://www.dw.com/en/which-eu-countries-accept-vaccinated-travelers/a-57808870  &gt; **People entering Spain** from what it deems ""risk"" areas — including many EU members and most other countries in the world — **can avoid quarantine requirements by showing proof of full vaccination with a jab approved by** the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or **the World Health Organization (WHO) at least 14 days before arriving**, proof of recovery from COVID-19, or a negative test.  [and noting here that Sinovac is included within this classification of vaccines approved by the WHO, even if it is not (yet) approved by the EMA]  &gt; **The Greek government** lists the following vaccines among those accepted: Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax, Johnson and Johnson, **Sinovac**, Sputnik V, Casino Biologics, and Sinopharm.  In contrast:  &gt; France recognizes all vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency and considers travelers fully vaccinated two weeks after their final dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or AstraZeneca jabs, and four weeks after the single shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.  So given that France specifically does not recognize vaccines that are (only) approved by the WHO, and also does not specifically name Sinovac, then presumably a person vaccinated with Sinovac might not be able to enter France (without an urgent need/without undergoing quarantine), even if they might be able to enter Greece or Spain.  Or as another example:  &gt; However, fully vaccinated passengers with valid vaccination certificates are entirely exempt, no matter the color code of the country they come from. **Cyprus accepts all vaccines approved for use in the EU as well as the Sputnik V and Sinopharm shots**.  This means that Sino**vac** specifically would not count for Cyprus, even if Sino**pharm** does.  If you actually were going to plan a trip to Europe, and you were vaccinated with Sinovac (or Sinopharm, as in the case of the San Juan), you'd basically have to check on a per-country basis.

I have no family or friends in the USA - This is NOT an exaggeration. I could get an apartment, but I just feel it would be pointless unless it's required for a passport - read below about that.  You choose to be homeless. That is your fault. You failed. How does one not have friends or family? Sounds like you have anti-societal problems. You failed.   &gt;I would like to travel to Philippines. I seem to like the people there more. They don't seem to have as much drugs or alcohol or smoking or random sex or vulgarity as much as America. I hate the USA because everyone I meet does ""Weed"", gets drunk and high, or smokes, takes pride in having sex with random people, have immense ego and entitlement, employees give the worst and unprofessional experience,band I just don't like people in the USA.  You know nothing about the PHILIPPINES probably other than Filipinas who will love you long time. Stop reading those SEX PAT blogs.   DRUGS are prevalent in the PHILIPPINES also and nothing more different than the States. If you tried to make some minimal effort, you can read about all the drug-related news. Like drinking doesn't exist here? It does. Everything you hate in the States exists in the PHILIPPINES as well. Think of the Philippines as little America.

If you had a permanent home then this wouldn't be an issue. Again that's your fault for living out of a car.   &gt;I don't have the Covid Vaccine because I think Covid is a overhyped propaganda piece, but I would be willing to get a vaccine to travel, otherwise I won't in America. I'll even wear a mask as mandatory even though I never wear one in the USA.  See previous post, but you are a COVID denier. You drank the q-anon Trump koolaid.

160,42,2,1623272819,"OFWs are victims. My fiance used to be one. The agency you sign on with holds your passport so you can't change your mind, and I think you have to pay them back for connecting you with an assignment. Once you're overseas, your boss will hold onto the passport so you can't leave. You work 6 days a week and would be lucky if you are able to use the phone, step outside to experience snow, or even go to church.  OFWs in the middle east have less rights. Muslim families will be hard on you and try to get you to switch religions in exchange for them to be nicer to you. They may try to rape you, so you have to look as unattractive as possible.  Unfortunately being an OFW is one of the few ways to make enough salary to support a family. The Philippines is a major producer of manpower for other countries. The OFW industry is strong. I remember one time I was flying out overseas for vacation, and a long line of pinays sat in a straight line at the airport. They all looked scared and sad, and were obviously headed for an OFW assignment.  What is worse than having one OFW in the family is having two OFWs. I know one little girl that doesn't want to stay with her mom or dad when they come back from the Philippines. She clings onto the friend that her parents left her with, and she can't sleep without the parents' friend.  But even though OFWs are victims, they are still heroes too. They sacrifice being with their families and agree to the abuse they receive overseas just so that their children could survive. If the OFWs didn't go abroad, perhaps their families would be living in the street searching for scraps of food in the trash.  My fiance and child are in the Philippines, but they can't come abroad to live with me because of the pandemic (there's no vaccine for young kids, and adults headed here have been getting infected on the airplanes). We may have been separated for over a year, and in a way I feel like an OFW trapped overseas. But instead of quitting my job and moving to them, I work and live abroad alone so that I can provide a roof over their heads and food for their stomach. I would rather sacrifice my wants and desires if it means my child is healthy and taken care of. I missed his first steps. I missed his first words. I missed his first time eating solid food.

174,56,0,1617251092,I don’t see how people aren’t understanding the dangers with the vaccine passport idea. It’s normalizing discrimination and hateful feelings toward those who won’t go along with the majority. It will not stop there. It never stops there.
