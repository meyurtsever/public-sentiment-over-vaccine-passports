16,16,1643996579,"&gt;  A lot of the decisions can be judged with hindsight, but it was an ever evolving situation with too many unknowns, and it was hard to make the right choices all of the time.  Except our so called 'experts' have been wrong and/or exaggerated nearly everything they've said. With Omicron, South Africa was already showing signs that that variant wasn't very dangerous and they had already peaked with cases if not nearly so and yet despite that data when cases started to rise here, they panicked and complete threw out the vaccine passport program anyways and pretty much admitted that they had little confidence that a nearly 90% vaccinated Ontarian population was enough to protect against Omicron and not require reintroduction of restrictions.  In otherwards the people who kept saying they would 'follow the science and data' didn't follow the science and data that they saw in other parts of the world.   &gt; We would need to experience the alternative reality where nothing was done to evaluate if it was just right or completely over the top.   Or maybe simply see what was happening in parts of the rest of the world and perhaps take that into consideration rather than making massive blanket restrictions that affected far too many people with far too little benefit.  Japan is that 'alternate reality' where a 1st world nation implemented minimal restrictions on its population and achieved massively better results while causing much less damage and destruction to their country and their people. Why ignore such a successful example that has been going on for 2 years now instead of saying, 'hey maybe we should give that a try'?  &gt; Other countries experienced much higher death tolls and disruption. So yeah, it sucked, mistakes were made, but maybe, just maybe, it could have been much worse.  Most poor African nations with much worse medical systems suffered much less than most western countries with vastly better medical systems. And I bet most African people weren't fanatical in following restrictions placed on them if they had many at all.  As I said, we could've largely achieved the same results by simply protecting the elderly and sick from the beginning of the pandemic and perhaps preventing thousands of deaths back then. And no one wants to include all the countless people who died because they needed treatment for non-covid issues and couldn't get it because everything was directed towards covid patients. No one wants to include all the other damages that were caused to people and their livelihoods because its all non-covid so who cares?  No one wants to admit the sad fact that the government's utter fanaticism in fighting covid did far more harm than than good. Whatever 'reward or benefits' that we got from trying to slow the spread of the virus was far, FAR outweighed by all the damage we did to ourselves.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/sjvf35/ontarios_top_health_official_says_it_may_be_time/hvl6fcg/

Kenney says Alberta’s high vaccination rate coupled with declining pressure on hospitals make it feasible to end the vaccine passport soon.  A week ago, Kenney said the passport could be eliminated by the end of March.  But since then Kenney has come under increasing pressure from members of his own United Conservative caucus to end the passport while also dealing with vaccine mandate protests by truckers and supporters who have created chaos and traffic tie-ups at Alberta’s main U.S. border checkpoint.  The truckers and some members of Kenney’s caucus say the passport has served its purpose, unfairly infringes on individual rights, and must be cancelled.  The passport – known in Alberta as a restriction exemption – mandates anyone using non-essential services such as bars and restaurants show proof of vaccination.

Eichmann was not Iago and not Macbeth, and nothing would have been farther from his mind than to determine with Richard III 'to prove a villain.' Except for an extraordinary diligence in looking out for his personal advancement, he had no motives at all… He merely, to put the matter colloquially, never realized what he was doing… It was sheer thoughtlessness—something by no means identical with stupidity—that predisposed him to become one of the greatest criminals of that period.  Remember, there are degrees of evil. Arendt was gesturing to only one of the most marked degrees of evil, but to all of our detriment our governments have drawn a through line from the current human rights violations to the horrible atrocities of our past.  This is unconscionable. See Reason 3 to understand why this occurred.  You are complicit.

91,4,1643656585,"&gt; Primarily the arrival of omicron. The vaccines were providing excellent reductions in transmission with the original and delta variants, as well as the reduced symptoms.  The vaccines were benefiting the elderly and the sick the most and not the majority of the rest of the population that were largely at least decently healthy and its always been that way. We're over 3 million confirmed covid cases after 2 years now and only 4% have ever been in hospital for the virus and well over half those patients were 60 years and older. And considering there's 9.8 MILLION people over the age of 60, even in that most vulnerable and at risk demographic they were barely affected by the virus.   &gt; When omicron arrived it infected the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike, though long term it proved the vaccine still provided notable reductions in symptoms.   Again the vaccines were suppose to handle situations like these where it was believed that getting your two shots would be enough to keep society open, especially with the passport where vaxxed were only hanging out with other vaxxed people making things even more safe.  But of course that didn't happen which is why the narrative now became 'it will reduce symptoms to be less severe' which did happen, but you can't even any longer say that it significantly reduced the virus spread when the majority of people had gotten their shots and the number of infections still went up dramatically.  &gt; And not because of the convoy, this was always going to happen, just a matter of when the circumstances would allow it since there was never a conspiracy to steal everyone's freedoms.  Edit: As far as vaccine requirements: they're not anything new, and weren't controversial until now. And even that's being generous since most people don't have issue with requirements like vaccines for some occupations or in order to travel internationally.  I don't know how you can say coercing people with extreme measures to get vaccinated isn't taking away one's freedom of personal choice all in the name of protecting society from a virus that can barely kill the most sick and elderly in our nation let alone more healthier and younger people.   Japan got it right. At the beginning of the pandemic when the severity of the virus was unknown, they too shutdown much of their nation for a few weeks. HOWEVER they evaluated the situation and the data and decided that the virus wasn't nearly as dangerous as initially thought and then they made the sane, rational decision of reopening their country almost fully and with few restrictions on their people.   2 years running and they've still been right all along while countries like Canada who had access to the same data as the Japanese, but decided to continue to double down on their double downs in an effort to eradicate covid rather than managing and living with it. Only now in the last week or two have our most fearmongering experts like Peter Juni have finally started saying that we should live with the virus.   Only 2 years too late after they caused so much destruction on our nation and our people and with their neverending fear campaign being so effective, now a certain amount of people may never be able to get back to living normally because they've been brainwashed so thoroughly as to how dangerous covid is and can't go back.  And with regards to vaccine requirements maybe that would've made sense if covid was much more dangerous than it really is or if the vaccines we have now were super effective in preventing someone from getting the virus and/or spreading it. In the end the virus was never as dangerous as it was always made out to be and the vaccines were never as effective as we had hoped and putting in all these restrictions and pretty much forcing people to get vaccinated was completely unnecessary and WRONG. We should've all stood up against this long ago and instead the majority laid down and took everything the government forced upon us without so much as a peep.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/sgnqgq/holding_a_mass_temper_tantrum_in_ottawa_disguised/hv14sol/

145,10,1643540492,"&gt;And if these people are afraid of side effects from a vaccine they're going to have a bad time learning about the side effects of actually catching covid.  People ought to be able to choose what ailments they are exposed to. 40% of people are asymptomatic to covid, source: [https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-3012](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-3012) . Perhaps a person feels more comfortable that they would be in this 40% group, compared to the vastly higher percentage of people who suffer some ailment from the vaccine. For example, the CDC reports \~77% of people get 'at least one systemic reaction', source: [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/reactogenicity.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/reactogenicity.html)   Therefore, if you wanted to have 0 side effects, you would have a better chance being in that 40% asymptomatic group, rather than the 23% (100-77) group that has so systemic reaction to the vaccines. Like who are you to tell a person they should take the riskier chance thing, but with less maximum risk, than the less riskier thing with more maximum risk? Why not let that person decide that for themselves?  Additionally, just as a cherry on top, I would say that there might be some argument on infection spread (though I'd still prefer people have the option to quarantine themselves) if the vaccines reduce transmission. However, we are actually seeing the exact opposite, both in countries across the world and in this country. In a Danish study, people with 2 doses who received the most recent one 91-150 days ago, actually had **negative effectiveness** in thwarting infection, -76.5% to be exact, so those people were more likely on average to catch covid! Source: [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.20.21267966v2.full.pdf](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.20.21267966v2.full.pdf)   Okay, that's Denmark, but what about Canada? Well, according to recent data, several provinces again show people with 2 doses of the vaccine are actually catching covid more per capita! Source: [https://nationalpost.com/health/omicron-unvaccinated-double-vaccinated-covid-positive](https://nationalpost.com/health/omicron-unvaccinated-double-vaccinated-covid-positive) ""In at least three provinces lately, Canadians who are double-vaccinated have been more likely to test positive for COVID than the unvaccinated"" This is not a case of 'oh there are more vaccinated people', this is PER CAPITA, this is ON AVERAGE! If our goal is to flatten the curve, bring the pandemic to an end, what say you to the double vaccinated who are catching covid at a higher rate in these provinces?  All this shows that, especially on these vaccines, they OUGHT to be treated like the flu vaccine: not mandatory, not needed to go to freaking Walmart for crying out loud, but if you want to get it to protect yourself, then get it, I don't care. But don't force others to! Why is that so hard to ask?  And finally, if you want to make the hospitalization argument (i.e. 'unvaccinated are clogging up the hospitals!'), are you going to put a ban on smoking, since those people are taking unnecessary risk that lands them in the hospital more often? What about obese people, you want to have some government mandate forcing people to be more in shape so they go to the hospital less? Because if you want to talk about who is taking up hospital space, there are a lot more easily preventable comorbidities that people have that we accept in our free society, and in a rich Western country we can afford to invest in our healthcare system, and in fact that might be one of the most important things we invest in. And, finally, if this was about keeping the hospitals open and running properly, why fire unvaccinated healthcare workers, especially since I just showed that double vaccinated people spread relatively similar to unvaccinated, if not more often in some provinces?  &gt;Does getting a passport restrict your freedom?  No, because a passport holder and non-passport holder can still engage in the same activities domestically. Next?  &gt;Does getting a driver's license restrict your freedom?  No, because I know plenty of people who don't have a drivers license, and can still access all the same places as people who do have ID and do the same things, provided they show SOME form of ID (i.e. can still buy liquor if they can prove their identity and age in a different way). Next?  &gt;Does getting a background check restrict your freedom?   Depends on the circumstances but I believe you are referring to private companies doing background checks (i.e. for employee hire). I'd say private corporations can decide who they want to do business with (besides to protected classes, i.e. they can't say 'we aren't going to allow people of this religion'), but that should not be some government mandate like it is at say Walmart. Walmart is forced to adhere to these mandates for all customers for all purchases, since the government decided their store is of some arbitrary size and therefore must enforce vaccine passports. If the corporation wanted to enforce vaccine passports themselves without the government telling them, then that's a different conversation, is that more what you are referring to here?  &gt;I would argue they all do yet we have no problem going through that process. People need to grow up and understand that a functioning society puts up restrictions around certain things for the benefit of society as a whole.  I just showed how all your examples are fundamentally different than the vaccine passports, which are used domestically for entry into basic stores such as Walmart. ""Benefit for society as a whole"" stops at bodily autonomy. Someone could make an argument ""oh you eating unhealthy food/smoking in your house (that you live in alone with no guests ever) all the time is not benefitting our society since you are less productive, less healthy, take up hospital space, etc. and if you would get in shape/stop smoking cigarettes our society would be better as a whole"", but no one thinks we should have government mandates on that because we allow personal autonomy to decide how you want to treat your body",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/sfd629/freedom_convoy_size_exaggerated_by_miscaptioned/huu8cww/

I think many if not most people disagree with many of the restrictions that the government and many major businesses have implemented, just that most would rather go along with it than stand up and oppose it.   Take vaccine passports for example. Even if you disagree with the government imposing it on Canadians, if you've already gotten your shots then why would you stand up and fight it instead of saying 'I may not agree with the passports, but I've already gotten my shots so it doesn't affect me anyways so why fight it?'  It seems like only now we're starting to see more vaccinated people stand up and say enough is enough and join in the opposition against the neverending restrictions imposed on Canadians.  &gt; Just because people are accepting more government power during a crisis doesn’t mean they’ll let them do whatever they want forever.

Aside from that you make good points (and I appreciate excellent conversation - thank you!), so I'm not arguing against you per se. Still, I'd like to discuss some nuances after your post.  \- Canada has had 3M cases of *confirmed* COVID to date (which obviously includes the huge Omicron bump), which is less than 10% of the population. Of course actual cases is going to be larger than the confirmed cases. Even so, I'm not positive everyone will get COVID, or at least not for some time.  \- Virus mutation to a Omicron-esque variant was a reasonable hope given other viruses historically, but not a certainty and with no definite time frame of arrival. You could not responsibly base policy on it at least.  \- Naturally I'll agree that vaccinations don't stop transmission. I don't agree the crux of vax passport argument was ever transmission prevention though. Slowing transmission was part, but the crux was restricting access to high-risk areas to those with protection. Instead of closing them completely we'd be able to re-open them but with the requirement that people needed protection to enter the high-risk areas. If exposed, as was much likelier, the person would have better chances of completely fighting off the disease plus excellent insurance against hospitalization/death.  \- About natural immunity, at the beginning people may have said no one knows how effective natural immunity is and to get vaccinated. Exact numbers weren't available and vaccines have an excellent risk/benefit ratio. The problem with relying on natural immunity is it requires infection with the associated illness and hazards. By last summer at the latest the scientific consensus was natural immunity + vaccinations = the best.  \- I hear good arguments for those people saying COVID is under AND overreported so I have no clue. I've fallen back on using excess deaths as a measure of severity.

Three multivariate logistic regression models were applied. In all models we evaluated four outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic disease, COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. The follow-up period of June 1 to August 14, 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant in Israel.  &gt; **Results:**  &gt; SARS-CoV-2-naïve vaccinees had a 13.06-fold (95% CI, 8.08 to 21.11) increased risk for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant compared to those previously infected, when the first event (infection or vaccination) occurred during January and February of 2021. The increased risk was significant (P&lt;0.001) for symptomatic disease as well. When allowing the infection to occur at any time before vaccination (from March 2020 to February 2021), evidence of waning natural immunity was demonstrated, though SARS-CoV-2 naïve vaccinees had a 5.96-fold (95% CI, 4.85 to 7.33) increased risk for breakthrough infection and a 7.13-fold (95% CI, 5.51 to 9.21) increased risk for symptomatic disease. SARS-CoV-2-naïve vaccinees were also at a greater risk for COVID-19-related-hospitalizations compared to those that were previously infected.  &gt; **Conclusions:**  &gt; This study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity. Individuals who were both previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and given a single dose of the vaccine gained additional protection against the Delta variant.

243,6,1643134895,"&gt; Maybe, and I'm just spitballing here, it's because there are currently ~300,000 active cases in Canada.  So there's some 300,000 active cases in the entire country......and we're only seeing a few thousand actually serious enough to end up in hospital and ONLY NOW in places like Ontario are they starting to differentiate between people actually in hospital getting treated for the virus versus going to the hospital for other medical issues and simply testing positive.  The point is only a tiny percentage of covid cases become serious enough as to require hospital treatment and for those 60 years and older, despite only making up 15% of confirmed covid cases, they make up 56% of all covid hospital cases and 62% of all ICU covid patients since the beginning of the pandemic.  The point is covid isn't putting tens of thousands of generally healthy people into hospitals and taking up resources even though they make up the vast majority of confirmed covid cases. Its putting the elderly and sick into hospital for covid and even their numbers have declined since getting their vaccinations.  &gt; I expect you'll see things opening up again soon in most provinces since they're over the Omicron hump and Delta's been quiet. Saskatchewan is still on the way up, though.  In Ontario for much of the summer last year the numbers were extremely low across the board and yet we still never fully reopened everything because 'we needed to do things slowly and safely' rather than reopening everything right away. By the time we were close to fully reopening things, Omicron arrived and they almost overnight abandon their reopening plans.  The vaccine passports and having only the vaxxed be allowed to gather with each other at restaurants, bars etc. was supposed to deal with rise in cases like this and yet they had so little belief in the vaccines that they threw out the whole program when Omicron cases kept rising proving that the passport system was all theater to begin with and that the vaxxed were lied to when they were assured that getting your shots and the passport was the key to returning back to normal life.

The passport will likely be dropped when covid is no longer considered a burden on our healthcare system. The effectiveness of the vaccines are approximately 6 months since viruses mutate and we are due for another. The goal of the vaccine rollout is mostly to reduce the amount of deaths which has gotten significant results. The second goal is to reduce the spread. Even if your aren't 100% immune, you still have a smaller chance of catching it. Even if there is 30% chance of still catching it while vaccinated, that has a significant impact on the spread. Basically the more people get vaccinated, fewer people will catch it, fewer people will be hospitalized, fewer people die. Herd immunity will result in more deaths and more hospitalizations. Also you can catch covid multiple times which means it will take allot longer to reach herd immunity. The easiest thing is to just get vaccinated.

This is what I judged your takeaway to be.   &gt;The vaccine passport system was introduced at the same time as many other wide sweeping restrictions, so how can anyone possibly say the effect is from the passports vs the overall increase in restrictions as a whole?  This is a very fair point! The rest is much less important.  But! Here's the thing. The amount of variables is spaghetti. And coming to any solid strong well supported conclusion is incorrect. Do mask mandates do anything? Do dining restrictions do anything?   Surely they must, as they reduce number of interactions and we know that transmission is driven solely through interaction. But the size and value of each measure really isn't known. All that we do know is that, in combination, all these measures seem to have done what we expect them to do and the vaccine passports drove an increase in vaccination in addition to whatever poorly understood benefit it provided. But the good news is that the one thing we do understand very clearly and concretely is that vaccination works.

263,0,1642883565,"As a Chinese-Canadian (I hold a Canadian passport and have been banned from entering China indefinitely due to COVID-19), I have heard of news pieces where Chinese government officials threaten and coerce immigrants to return. This is generally not a good strategy though. If I am in Canada and I know I am a wanted person in China to the point that the Chinese police are harassing me by phone or in person, I would never return. It is better for me to get murdered by Chinese police in Canada, let the local police and RCMP investigate the murder, than for me to return to China and be disappeared forever, even though the murderer will never be brought to justice.  I have been joking with my mother about the opposite problem that she may face: being banned from entering China due to COVID-19. Full disclosure: my mother has 3 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and has a QR code to prove it.  You see, my mother entered Canada on a ""parent and grandparent super visa"" (introduced way back in 2012 to allow parents and grandparents of Canadian citizens and permanent residents to visit Canada long term). At the time, she was approved for a 2 year stay (she needed to buy her own health insurance but that is it). At the time, she already had an immigration application pending.  Shortly after she landed under the super visa scheme, her immigration application was approved and she ""soft crossed"" the US-Canada border with just her Chinese passport with a newly issued immigration visa on foot (by soft crossing, I mean you leave the Canadian side but never try to enter the US and since she did not have a US visa, she would not have been allowed to go to the US anyway). Once she did that, she became a permanent resident and has had this status ever since. Her passport expired in 2021 though, and something weird is happening. Let me explain.  Back in July of 2021, right around the time that her passport expired, the National Immigration Administration of China issued an order to severely limit who is allowed to apply for Chinese passports. Only those with an Offer of Admission to a foreign school or a job offer from a foreign employer is allowed. Since this order, very ridiculous stories have surfaced:  1. Middle-aged woman in China tries to apply for a passport to go to America because her daughter gave birth to a baby there and she wants to visit. The Chinese authorities refused her passport application citing COVID-19 restrictions. 2. Chinese man who frequently flew between Shanghai and Los Angeles pre-pandemic because his wife and son both live in America got stopped by Chinese Customs officials despite having a valid passport and US Visa. They make him show his wife's ID and even his child's birth certificate, and was questioned extensively on why he needed to go. Once he landed at LAX, he (a foreign national by definition) was not scrutinized by American officials at all, in sharp contrast to when he was exiting China (a country where he is a citizen). 3. Chinese person immigrated to Singapore and has permanent residence status there. Due to the pandemic, the person's passport cannot be renewed at the embassy and as a result, they risked losing permanent residence status and face deportation to China (granted, that in Canada, if you are a permanent resident, it is not mandatory for you to have a passport from your country of origin, nor is it mandatory to possess a permanent resident card, as long as you remain in Canada, so this story applies to only certain countries). The person in question owns a condo in Singapore and may be forced to sell it if permanent residence status is lost.  So, going back to my mother, her passport expired 6 months ago. Since she is not a Canadian citizen, she is not able to get a Canadian passport. But when I went onto the app (Chinese Consulate) that is used to apply for Chinese passports, I realized the required documents are ridiculous. Not only do you need your expired passport and photos for the new passport, you also need to go through facial recognition, submit a document (like a health card, driver's license or bank statement) to prove which province in Canada you live in). In addition, there is a requirement for a photo of the applicant holding up a copy of a recent mainstream newspaper (by recent, they mean within 3 days of taking the photo). They also have this warning: due to COVID-19, in person applications for passports are not accepted, and as a result, your passport will not contain your fingerprint and therefore, you will not be able to use the self serve kiosk when entering China.  Given how hard it is to get a passport these days, I have doubts on whether my mother will even be allowed to get a passport. If she cannot get one, she becomes *de facto* stateless and will have no choice but to apply for Canadian citizenship.  I know this story seems to be irrelevant to this discussion, but it serves to show that in China, citizens can be treated in extreme ways (some are coerced to return or outright kidnapped from other places and transported to China, while others are refused passports or permits). Hong Kong politician Leung Kwok-Hung (the man with really long hair) was one of the most famous Chinese citizens who are banned from entering China due to his anti-CCP views.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/sa8av1/chinas_efforts_to_force_return_of_citizens_whove/htscry8/

Thing is, there's also protection left over from infection to consider, as well as the varying amount of protection and limited duration of a third dose. Requiring a third dose isn't a panacea and it doesn't prevent transmission. Requiring it for the vaccine passport would not be an evidence-based policy if the goal was reducing spread.

Legault wants to be reelected, so he needs to play nice with the base. The policies come and go according to poll numbers, but the societal damage they've done isn't so easily dispelled. The hatred that has consumed the hearts of millions who now openly welcome persecution of people who refuse vaccination is gonna stay with us for years and possibly decades to come.  It reminds me of the stuff we did to the first nations. We needed their lands to expand our industry and build hydroelectric dams. Natives were in the way, somewhat inconvenient, so we learned to hate them, then we shoved them on reservations and took their kids into catholic re-education centers were many died and got raped as the whole were taught to hate their parents and traditions. And now my home has cheap eco-friendly central heating. Yay! Such progress!  The unvaccinated are the newest minority to be persecuted. Doesn't really matter if you persecute somebody for their race, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, way of life, or their vaccination status. I don't care if this pressure we're putting on the unvaxxed eventually leads to fewer hospitals being overwhelmed during the big spikes. Shit is just wrong. How far will it go? Are we gonna kick them out at some point? Force the vaccine into their arms at gunpoint? Put'em in reeducation camps until they learn to love and obey the government? I dunno. They are, as of right now, effectively second class citizens. That's already a big yikes.  Unless of course they cave in and get the jab. Do you know what that does to a man, psychologically? To take the coward's way out? It breaks them. Destroys their pride. Often leads to substance abuse and suicide. You force a man into submission you might as well cut off his cock and hand him the rope to hang himself with. Humans are meant to be free, even if it means they sometimes make bad choices. You gotta be patient. Show them the data, convince them over time. And if it's still a hard 'no', then leave them be. Or at least strike them a deal. If they don't get the jab, hospitals will be free to refuse them service if they get down bad with Covid. Then we lift all restrictions and call it a wrap, pandemic over, learn to live normal life again despite Covid being a background threat.

355,1,1641972792,"For one, it's not mandatory for businesses to implement. In Alberta, no business is required to implement the Restrictions Exemption Program, it is simply encouraged for businesses because it allows them to operate at higher capacities and ignore certain health restrictions. In effect, many businesses opted in because they need the revenue, however, it was framed as entirely voluntary instead of being mandatory for the specific reason that one of Kenney's promises was that Alberta would not issue vaccine passports, and there was staunch opposition from some UCP members.   This is not the case in other provinces. Vaccine passports are mandatory for many businesses in other provinces. For example, In Alberta, restaurants that wish to provide indoor dining will need to check for vaccine status, whereas in BC, any restaurant that provides table service (including patio and other outdoor service) is required to check for vaccinations. Here in Alberta, places of worship are not eligible for the vaccine passport at all, meaning they have to abide by more stringent public health guidelines. This is in contrast to BC and Quebec's guidelines. In BC, if a religious congregation is 100% vaccinated for 12+, there are no capacity limits. In Quebec, vaccination is required for entry into houses of worship, with exceptions for the homeless. One of the Sikh temples I attend here in Edmonton wanted to implement the REP so that they wouldn't have to abide by strict capacity rules as their space is very small. They were told they couldn't and because of this langar (free veg. meal) service is greatly reduced.   Alberta was also one of the last provinces to implement a proof of vaccine program to access certain businesses (we were second only to SK IIRC). This despite high support for such a system in the province. We only implemented it after COVID cases got so high a public health emergency was declared in September 2021.   I'm not a member of the 'everything Kenney does is terrible, UCP are worse than the Nazis' echo-chamber many in my province seem to be a part of (just look at the Alberta provincial subreddit), but our restrictions are slightly less than other provinces, and the whole 'it's voluntary' aspect was clearly meant to avoid blowback from the antivax crowd.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/s1jpqt/quebec_to_impose_significant_financial_penalty/hsbm9ck/

[Ontario, Mar. 2021 \[""Environmental Scan:  COVID-19 Immunity Status and Considerations  for Public Health Measures,"" Public Health Ontario\]](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/phm/2021/03/covid-19-environmental-scan-immunity-passports.pdf?la=en):  This is a policy research document about immunity status/vaccination status is reflected in extra-jurisdiction policy, weighing the merits of a passport system. The policy research document is framed at answering whether vaccine/immune status is a viable tool  for reducing restrictions.  &gt;It is important to have a robust framework by  which to assess population-level risks and benefits of immunization-based relaxation of public health  measures. Critically, advice should be sought from public health ethicists to examine the implications of  unequal application of liberties and residual risks, and the potential for exacerbating the inequities  experienced by Ontario populations during the pandemic. With emerging VOC demonstrating some risk  for vaccine escape, relaxing measures must be addressed through a cautious and informed  approach.   &gt;   &gt;Given recent changes to the interval from first dose to second dose in Canada, the population of fully  vaccinated individuals, using the US CDC definition, is unlikely to increase in the near-term, leaving  primarily health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities as the main groups fully  vaccinated.    Relaxation of individual-level case and contact management measures (E.g., requirements  for quarantine) and setting-specific measures (E.g., visitor policies for long-term care) may be  contemplated given the full vaccination of these populations, but it is important to consider the low  community-level rates of fully vaccinated individuals that is likely to persist for several months, as well  the residual risks from VOC with vaccine escape and vaccine failure for those who are vaccinated.  Of course, I'm sure there are many more policy documents out there combing through this in fine detail. But it's important to remember that the passports weren't originally intended as a coercive measure; rather, as a measure to allow the retraction of certain public health restrictions.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/s1dpz8/tightening_rules_for_the_unvaccinated_is/hs8gd23/

So it's unclear if there's any scientific justification for mandating vaccination at this point.

Jane can spread Omicron to Betty just as easily regardless of whether Jane or Betty are vaccinated. Our current vaccines do not provide significant protection against infection with or transmission of Omicron. In fact, [the latest study out of Toronto](https://hospitalhealthcare.com/covid-19/third-covid-19-vaccine-dose-37-effective-against-omicron-after-7-days/) shows that those with two doses of a vaccine actually had an increased chance of infection relative to the unvaccinated. To be clear, I'm not citing this in support of the idea that the vaccines actually cause a reduction in immunity. This is almost certainly not the case. The increased chance of infection is most likely because we allow the vaccinated to acquire vaccination passport and travel / mingle more freely than the unvaccinated.  If Betty is overweight, it endangers Jane because she is increasing the odds she will require hospitalization related to her obesity, and if that occurs, she'll be taking up resources that will be unavailable if Jane simultaneously requires hospital treatment for any other condition.

But they do prevent infection to the point where it can't even be detected on a test and where you yourself are not spreading it.  I mean you're the one posting semantic BS dude. You said it prevents infection and act like it's some kind of shocker that people who were vaccinated 6 months ago have a weaker immune response are developing more serve illnesses and as such are no longer considered fully vaccinated. Let me quote you a few times here.   &gt;Me: Vaccines don't prevent you from contracting viruses.  &gt;Sure they do, at least to some extent. In the past we could see from data that vaccinated people were less likely to even get COVID to begin with. That is no longer true.  You can call it semantics if you want to but language matters and when you say things like ""vaccines don't prevent you from getting covid anymore"" you're spreading bullshit misinformation. Especially after a new variant comes out and you sound like they're not effective.  People who don't know better are going to read it and be misinformed. Talking about vaccines in terms of a magic shield isn't only stupid, it's dangerous and a serious public health issue. Look at what you said here:  &gt;Are...are you denying that previous covid vaccines reduced the chances one would get infected with COVID?  The previous vaccines are the same ones we have now. You're acting like they're useless when I clearly linked that a booster provided the same protection against all variants it did before. You're not talking about vaccinations. You're talking about vaccines. It's not semantics. You're saying ""the vaccines no longer work"" and it's dangerously misleading and false.  &gt;On say, October 15, 2021 (just picking a random date) the rate of COVID cases (per capita of course) for unvaccinated people was 7.68, while it was 1.36 for fully vaccinated people. The per capita rate of COVID cases was far higher for unvaccinated people.  &gt;Is that because the vaccine prevented vaccinated people from exposure to COVID? No, it's because the vaccine reduced the chance that COVID would progress to the point where it could even be detected on a test.  Yes, agreed. This is my point. Vaccines work.  &gt;Now look at January 1, 2022. Now the numbers are different, and the COVID cases per capita are no longer heavily skewed towards the unvaccinated.  Yes, they clearly are, because people without the booster are no longer fully vacinated. Like I explained previously before linking to the scientific evidence that boosters provide very good protection.  &gt;Now the vaccinated have a higher case rate per capita. Which is the point I was making all along. In the past, vaccines prevented the vaccinated from getting COVID, as we can see from case rates per capita. Now that is no longer true.  No, it's entirely true and the facts have not changed. People with adequate vaccination to be considered ""fully vaccinated"" are being making up 3% or so of hospitalizations. I said this and you replied with results of a population that only recently started administering the booster in the middle of the holiday season with an strain of the virus that is 10 times more virulent.  Needing a booster doesn't mean the vaccines are not working as well as they used to. It just means they require booster shots which is a normal part of any vaccination schedule. Of any medical treatment really. It's like claiming that Tylenol doesn't alleviate headaches because you took one 12 hours ago and your headache came back. It's exactly like that. And it's nonsense.  &gt;LOL, this is complete bullshit. Fully vaccinated has always referred to the number of doses you've had. Every single health authority uses that criteria  I mean you have to use your brain here. It's number of doses over time. Those statements were given in that context for sure. If one dose meant you're ""not fully vaccinated"" because they saw in trials it's immune response quickly faded without the second booster dose giving a more lasting immune response that per your data lasted till October, and 2 doses has clearly faded over about 6 months, what does that mean?  If you vaccinate your dog for rabies they're fully vaccinated for 1-3 years. They are. It fades after than then and you need a booster. Is your dog vacinated 5 years later? Take all the time you'd like to answer.  &gt;Their definition of fully vaccinated cases is: Number of cases where symptoms started 14 days or more after receiving: the second dose of a 2-dose vaccine series, or a single-dose vaccine series (for example, Janssen). Get the fuck out of here with this gaslighting.  Well dude what do you want me to say? When you have a brilliant shining light like Doug Ford at the helm WTF kind of responses do you expect? Yes, you do have to think for yourself from time to time. They have yet to officially change it but again if you just you know, read the news, you'll see everyone prepping to make the change.  It obviously has changed and the reasons it hasn't become official yet is political not medical. They want to make sure everyone has had a chance to actually get the third shot because it totally limits your access to society via passports and mandates. I can't think of anything more ignorant than taking your medical cues from Doug Fucking Ford. Look at the man. Do you think he has an inkling about health? And I mean, again, if you just paid attention to the news even a little bit it's obvious it's changed. It's been discussed for over a month. Shit people have been talking about it since the summer.

The vaccine against covid works. **That is a cold, hard, scientific fact supported by countless peer-reviewed studies from world-class scientists**. Not getting it makes you liable to spread the disease, therefore making you responsible for making people sick. Hence my point: there is no downside to getting the vaccine - it increases your resistance against the disease if you're unlucky enough to get it. Instead of owning up to that and admitting that this is wrong, ethically speaking, you will diverge the conversations to ""but the governement, lockdowns, restrictions, muh freedom, muh rights, tokebekicitte, etc.""  Here's another fact: if over 98% (or thereabouts) of the population gets the vaccine, and gets the booster shots once they are offered, there would be no need for any restriction, lockdown, curfews, or vaccine passport. None of that would be necessary, because we would have enough immunity among the population to make the virus less of a threat to our health system. Things would not be perfect, and the government needs to eventually fix the problems that covid highlighted (otherwise all this will happen again next time a pandemic happens and we don't have the vaccine yet).   But the fact is, the problems happening right now with our health system are **preventable ones**. How? With a free, super accessible vaccine that you can get near where you live.

After two full years of anti-vaxxer bullshit arguments, I've seen enough of their asinine logic and arguments that yours looked superficially like some of their common rhetoric. Typically, if they make the mistake of referring to 'a' or 'the' vaccine, you can be pretty much assured that they have not done a lick of actual research into the actual vaccines, how they work, what they've been tested on, how old the technology is, etc. The very fact they see it as monolithic is generally the tip of the iceberg of their ignorance.  Hence my request for clarification.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Currently - its very clear the passport hasn't had its desired effect - otherwise we wouldn't be seeing massive case spikes and the need to implement soft lock downs.  And you put that down to the 'failure' of the passport concept and not the rise of a new variant that's got the perfect conditions for widespread dissemination, ie. likely airborne transmission, high transmissibility, lower lethality?  When the passports were created, all known variants at that time were being passed more effectively by the unvaccinated. It was not in any way a dumb idea to allow the vaccinated to continue to operate and keep the primary vectors on a shorter leash.

When AZ was phased out of pharmacies over Summer 2021, the reason given by the BC CDC was that the efficacy of the mRNA vaccines is better.  There's still the issue that the mRNA vaccines are orders of magnitude riskier for young males than people over 60, and the other issue that the prognosis for a covid hospitalized 80 year old is several orders of magnitude worse than a hospitalized young person to say nothing of the case to hospitalization to icu to death rate.  Both stats end up flattened before they're presented to the public, I assume because of the fear that the public would treat it as a disease of the elderly and already sick and not be up for what we've done.  1) The younger self selling point would be more cogent if the averaging across demographics weren't happening.  I remember the general sense of shock early on when the median age of covid deaths was over 80.  This was not part of the BC public health narrative.  Nor was the nature of the comorbidities in the sick and dying.  This was likely to instill a disproportionate sense of risk in younger people by leaving it up to their imaginations and was a bit unfair.  Maybe it was just the media, but I used to watch Bonnie Henry's briefings and these weren't exactly pointing me in the right direction.  2) Yes nutters misrepresent ""less effective"" as ""not effective"".  I agree. Radicalized people cannot be reached.  The best you can hope for is for time to prove them wrong and to be forgiving and welcoming if they want to leave the cave.  Goes for people who panic at the thought of pre-pandemic life as much as it goes for people who've thought the whole response is running on carefully pulled strings.  I do disagree that the honest messaging was tried though.  At least in my province.  We tried nice, calm messaging, but never frank and honest messaging.  The mask fiasco at the beginning was bad.  The treatment of natural immunity was bad and in Canada it's sill bad.  The confusion between ""of"", ""from"", ""with"" covid was bad.  Changing accommodations for unvaccinated people on flights and in work places because there needed to be a difference between LPC and CPC approaches during the election was bad.  These are Canada specific.  --- My issue with anti-vaxxer is that it now applies to people who oppose any regulation for mandating any vaccine.  If someone does not like the idea of the passport they are an anti-vaxxer under this new definition and this label still has power because of what it used to mean.  The label is also being overloaded and dehumanized to make people fearful of the social consequences of having it applied to them.    I do not think that someone who's against government granting itself new powers, that might be used under different circumstances, should be stigmatized as though they were doing the thing the government doesn't approve of.  I don't think people should have the right to drive under the influence or distracted.  I also wouldn't demand that people with poor but legal vision get their eyes fixed before they drive because there's room for improvement.  All other things equal they're going to be more dangerous to share a road with people who have great vision, but they're legally good enough.  In the same way, with omicron, it's no longer equivalent to legally blind vs 20/20, they both have issues with transmission.

Despite all the fears of side effects from the vaccines the message has always been that the risks of getting the vaccine are far outweighed by the consequences of getting COVID, regardless of your age. And the public is horrible at calculating risk: you have people who are still using the ""chance of side effects"" excuse even though their risk is MINISCULE.   &gt; 2) Yes nutters misrepresent ""less effective"" as ""not effective"". I agree. Radicalized people cannot be reached. The best you can hope for is for time to prove them wrong and to be forgiving and welcoming if they want to leave the cave. Goes for people who panic at the thought of pre-pandemic life as much as it goes for people who've thought the whole response is running on carefully pulled strings.  Or, like smokers where smoking is forbidden in many places, require vaccination to be able to enter. Because clearly, if they're left to their own devices then they will just choose to reinforce their own beliefs about why the vaccines don't work, and then end up contracting COVID and spreading it to other nutters, a not-insignificant fraction of whom will end up flooding the ICUs. You can reason about and cajole them, and at the end of the day any progress you have made will be wiped out when they log in to facebook and get fed the same talking points over and over again. It's like wilful brainwashing at this point.  &gt; I do disagree that the honest messaging was tried though. At least in my province. We tried nice, calm messaging, but never frank and honest messaging. The mask fiasco at the beginning was bad. The treatment of natural immunity was bad and in Canada it's sill bad. The confusion between ""of"", ""from"", ""with"" covid was bad. Changing accommodations for unvaccinated people on flights and in work places because there needed to be a difference between LPC and CPC approaches during the election was bad. These are Canada specific.  I cannot speak for BC as I do not live there. But I have personally seen interviews on CTV news IIRC where vaccine news have pretty obvious disclaimers about how well they are at preventing severe disease and death even if not infection.  &gt; My issue with anti-vaxxer is that it now applies to people who oppose any regulation for mandating any vaccine. If someone does not like the idea of the passport they are an anti-vaxxer under this new definition and this label still has power because of what it used to mean. The label is also being overloaded and dehumanized to make people fearful of the social consequences of having it applied to them.  Perhaps it might be because I live in a different province, but I have not seen this effect happen anywhere IRL. Maybe on the internet. But the antivaxxers who I have worked with in the past were treated normally and nobody bothered to intrude on their decision.  &gt; I do not think that someone who's against government granting itself new powers, that might be used under different circumstances, should be stigmatized as though they were doing the thing the government doesn't approve of.   That is what I believe is a slippery slope fallacy. The mere _possibility_ of it being used under different circumstances does not have to mean that you stop something that is justified to be beneficial.  &gt; I don't think people should have the right to drive under the influence or distracted.  And that's what's happening here.  &gt; In the same way, with omicron, it's no longer equivalent to legally blind vs 20/20, they both have issues with transmission.   Except one group is far more likely to end up in the ICU? As for transmission, I believe one way to reduce it is for people to use n95s more widely, but I think fit testing on a mass scale is infeasible. I'm not a public health expert though so I just defer to them.  &gt; But to me what I was writing about was overloading words, weaponizing them socially and applying them more broadly. My smoker example isn't great but I didn't want to use a marginalized group of people for illustrative purposes.  Well that's great because unlike getting a vaccine, a person doesn't _choose_ to belong to a marginalized society on purpose. (Unless they have a persecution fetish.

If the answer to that is 'never', then you're not really opposing on any rationale standard, because there's going to be a point where the public health authorities will HAVE to make these kinds of decisions to protect public health.

469,9,1641491348,"&gt; but you understand the reason why we shouldn't just allow people to choose not to get vaccinated is because it reduces the efficacy of the vaccine right?  If the vaccine is effective then why do you need everyone to get it to maintain its effectiveness? You should be protected regardless if anyone around you is vaxxed or not. Also its interesting how as soon as there was a rise in cases, the vaccine passport program was IMMEDIATELY thrown out the window. You know how vaccinated people would be allowed to hang around other vaxxed people because the risk of spread was low among them?  As I said that line of BS was quickly exposed to be false when at the first sign of trouble the vaxxed can't even hang out with their fellow vaxxed people because of the fear that the vaccine couldn't do its job to protect all those who got their two and three shots.  &gt; It's not about only protecting the individual, allowing for people to not get vaccinated means we create potential for outbreaks, rather than herd immunity.  And yet with near 90% vaccination rate among the 12+ population in Canada that hasn't done anything to stop infections from rising. So you don't trust the vaccines enough to protect the people and not have to shutdown society again and you don't trust the vaccines enough to prevent the spread of the virus. So what's the point of getting everyone vaxxed when again at the first sign of trouble you don't even believe in the vaccines that you insist will save everyone from the pandemic and then go back into panic mode and shut everything down again?  Also I just looked it up and did you know that 223,000 Canadians over 70 died in 2021? Contrast that with about 24,000 people 70+ who have died to covid over 2 years of pandemic, it means that on average 12,000 per year died to covid in the 70+ age demographic. That means that super scary covid was responsible for barely 5% of all 70+ senior deaths annually even among the absolutely most impacted and vulnerable age demographic.  I mean seriously you'd think that with the most at risk groups of people covid should be ravaging them and there should be tens of thousands of deaths among them and yet this virus can't even do that. Here's a thought perhaps we should spend more resources on preventing the other 95% of 70+ people dying annually than worrying so much about the virus that's only responsible for 5% of deaths from that age group the past couple of years?  Also just saying that African nations collectively have a combined vaccination rate of barely 10% and have most have poor medical systems to deal with covid patients and guess what? They're still doing orders of magnitude better than all us super advanced western countries. So if vaccination is so important then why are African nations doing so great vs pretty much any western nation and all their highly vaccinated populations and advanced medical systems?  And also lets never mention Japan who had such low vaccination rates until July 2021 and they too never died by the tens of thousands.

476,5,1641391630,"&gt; Right, but that means that over half are happening outside of LTC's - and again, that's already with the help of the vaccines slowing the spread down and helping create stronger immune responses, leading to higher survival rates.  The fact that you're not mentioning is that long before vaccines existed and were widely available, it was mainly the 70 and older demographics that were predominately dying from the virus. There was a significant amount of deaths among the 60-70 age group, but nothing like in the 70+ group which represented the vast majority of covid deaths. The 60 and older groups still represent like 94% of all covid deaths in Canada right now.  The point is many people keep talking about the vaccines effectiveness, but they're not willing to admit that the effectiveness VARIES GREATLY depending on age demographics. For seniors and people who have medical conditions, the vaccines benefited them significantly which is why the number of deaths plummeted as soon as the majority of them got their vaccinations. Even now with Omicron it so far hasn't affected the 60 and over crowd too much in pushing the death rate back up. So the vaccines work well for them.  HOWEVER for the 50 and under age groups, there weren't many deaths before the vaccine existed and the same holds true now. Namely the virus never affected anyone 50 and under and were decently healthy in any significant way even before they got vaccinated. This is especially true for 20 and under people who still have a combined 20 deaths to covid and barely makeup 2% of all hospital cases in Canada.  If we're talking strictly on facts, it seems like our experts and politicians who are hellbent on getting everyone vaccinated want to completely ignore THESE facts that go against their narrative that everyone needs the shot. So it looks like 'facts matter' until it shows something they don't like and then they ignore/cover it up. Yeah we can TOTALLY trust these people. &gt;_&gt;  &gt; If we didn't have the vaccination rate we do now, deaths would have been even higher, potentially with more variants being produced.  Deaths have always been the highest among 70+ people and have NEVER been high among the 50 and under people. This was the case long before vaccines existed. Now that they're widely available vaccines have greatly reduced senior deaths which is awesome, but has impacted people under 50 much less. Maybe it helped them get more milder symptoms if they caught the virus, but it certainly has little impact on deaths.  &gt;  If we all wore masks constantly, and didn't relax once things started looking up, we'd still be in a better position than we are today, but vaccines are a key component to us getting this thing over with.  The Japanese people have worn masks regularly, but that's pretty much ALL they've done consistently and they've been living near normal lives since May 2020. If Canadians were told that regular mask wearing would allow them to get back to almost normal lives like the Japanese have I'm sure most would take that deal, but I doubt our government would stop with the shutdowns and restrictions just because we all wore masks regularly.   And lets be real. If vaccines were the key in ending this pandemic then we wouldn't be shutting down again and putting in more restrictions when almost 90% of all Canadians have gotten their two shots. The WHOLE POINT of achieving such high vaccination rates and getting the passport was to deal with exactly this kind of situation. By their actions they're pretty much admitting that they have no belief that the vaccines are doing their job otherwise they wouldn't be taking such drastic measures when so many Canadians have 'done their duty' and have gotten their shots because they believed what our experts and politicians told them, but now all these double and even triple vaccinated people who got their passports all ready to go are STILL being treated like the unvaxxed anyways at the first sign of trouble.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/rv5jvw/ontario_closes_schools_until_jan_17_bans_indoor/hrcs3cu/

481,10,1641406735,"&gt; Lots of people died who were under 50 and healthy prior, and even thinking of it in the simple died vs. survived dichotomy isn't right. Many survived with complications and disabilities. And even if it were ""only"" a few people, it would be worth the rest of us getting vaccinated, to help them.  Yes people under 50 have died. A grand total of 821 in almost 2 years of the pandemic. A grand total of 20 people under 20 years old have died all this time. Yes THESE are the numbers that we should lose our minds over when far more people under 50 die to a number of other things than they ever will of covid.  I get it. We don't want anyone to die, but the reality is that in Ontario ALONE nearly 300 people die everyday in this province of various causes and yet why have we never shutdown society to prevent all THOSE deaths? Contrast that to if nearly 300 people dying to covid everyday in the province and we would never reopen to normal for perhaps years.   So my question is why have we gotten use to and accepted that people die when it comes to for non-covid causes, but we can't accept that people die of covid too and get on with life especially when so few are dying to covid these days thanks to the most vulnerable being vaccinated?  And if we're talking about 'not overwhelming' our hospitals, simply reducing heart disease cases or obesity related illnesses would lower our hospital numbers far more than eradicating covid ever will. Covid will eventually be largely a non-issue whether it be months or a year or two more. Heart diesease/obesity etc. illness will still be around indefinitely taking up hospital resources and spending money in reducing that would benefit the medical far money forever than spending so much time and energy on covid ever will.  Also at the beginning of the pandemic back in 2020, through emergency measures Ontario was able to open up 10,000+ beds and 2,400 ICU beds for covid patients. So we're very far away from having our medical system 'collapse' if we're taking measures to create space to treat patients.  &gt; Also, we're only sitting at a 76.49% of the population who are fully vaccinated (that's not even accounting for the booster shot). Vaccines do work, but when we have people lagging in getting vaccinated (due to antivaxers, but also disparities in vaccine availability on a global level), it results in new variants being created. This is why we're shutting down again currently, because of Omicron.  If you're not counting 11 and under kids who are barely affected by the virus, we're at 87%+ vaccination rate for 12 and older which is among the highest in the world. Also you keep saying 'anti-vaxxer' when probably a large portion of people who are unvaccinated are most likely in the pro-choice category and aren't against people deciding to get the shot if they want it. If you want the shot then by all means get it, but don't force your paranoia on other people because the neverending fearmongering from our experts and the media has gotten to you.  &gt; I disagree, if our infection rates and ICU rates were low, then I don't think we would be shutting down. The reason we are now isn't because the government wants to go back on a promise they made to those who are vaccinated, it's because we're at risk for our healthcare system collapsing, because a new variant is ripping through our population   Our infection rates, hospital and ICU numbers were low for the entire summer and up until December yet we never fully reopened because of super spooky Delta variant and the fear that THAT variant might 'overwhelm our syste'. So yeah I seriously doubt that our experts care about the numbers because when they're high they go nuts in trying to decrease them and when they're very low they'll drag out the reopening 'just to be sure' and by then fall has come and/or a new 'variant of concern' pops up that makes fully reopening not possible.  Compare that to Japan that has seen several spikes in cases the past 2 years and their response is STILL to keep things open, but to on a few occasions ask businesses to closer earlier AND THAT'S IT. THAT'S what WE should be doing and that's what we were assured would happen once we got high vaccination rates and the passport.  The fact that we've gone back to shutting things down and imposing restrictions even on the fully vaccinated and have completely thrown out the vaccine passport program means our politicians and experts have little faith in the vaccines being able to do their job. If they weren't deceiving the public and believed in the vaccines as much as they said they did, then they'd keep the vaccine passport system going and allow the vaccinated to gather with other vaccinated because supposedly the transmission between vaxxed people was suppose to be many times lower than the unvaxxed.   That whole program got flushed down the toilet at the first sign of trouble and now the vaxxed are being treated no differently as the unvaxxed like I and many others predicted would happen. Won't be surprised if/when people with 2 shots will no longer be considered 'fully vaccinated'. Heck the Toronto local news have already been saying 'fully vaccinated which is being considered 2 doses AT THIS TIME' for almost a couple of weeks now.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/rv5jvw/ontario_closes_schools_until_jan_17_bans_indoor/hrdvdyd/

We're still talking about hundreds, not thousands of unvaxxed covid patients in Ontario hospitals. Namely unvaxxed covid patients ARE NOT rising in massive amounts right now just as they didn't during the super infectious Delta wave and I bet it will remain that way.   &gt; The only reason it doesn’t look so bad is because so many people got the vaccine. It alleviates both transmission and hospitalization, though not nearly as much as we had hoped unfortunately.   On July 1st of this year Japan only had about 15% fully vaccinated people in their nation and they only really ramped up vaccination after that time. The point is the Japanese have place few restrictions on its population during the entire pandemic and had low vaccination rates for months when vaccines were readily available and yet they still have 12,000 fewer deaths than Canada does despite having a 36 million senior population and over 3x more people in their country living in mostly densely population cities.  Perfect storm for covid to run wild in Japan and yet they came out doing better than every major western nation by a country mile. Vaccines weren't significant in their success all that time before vaccines were available and now they've gotten much of their population vaccinated and they still remain open largely business as usual unlike Canada where our leaders and experts are going into insane crazy mode and shutting things down again.   &gt; I don’t envy those in charge right now, if measures work you’re a piece of shit because hypothetically we didn’t need them at all, and if they don’t you’re a piece of shit because you should’ve.   I agree its a shitty position to be in, but if I were in charge right now I'd keep most everything open. Our politicians and 'medical experts' assured us that high vaccination rates and passports would keep things open and yet at the first sign of trouble they've gone back to treating the fully vaxxed the same as the unvaxxed, passport or no passport, double or triple shotted or not.   How do you expect people to believe in you anymore when you tell people to get their shots and passport because the whole point of doing so was for things to stay open in situations like this?

593,2,1639946401,"Until those citing health care capacity as the reason for the reimposition of restrictions understand that a sizeable portion (possibly a majority) of the population no longer trust the government then we will never solve the systemic issues driving negative outcomes. Public health official and politicians have failed to hold up their end of the bargain in pandemic response and people are no longer willing to sacrifice their good years to protect those who won't protect themselves.    You can make the argument that it takes time to expand capacity, but we've not seen any steps taken to do so in two years. In fact, governments have been reigning in health care spending and cutting wages. We also see examples of people looking to get into health care being rejected despite exceptional academic performance (the young woman in Nova Scotia from a few months ago comes to mind).  Here's some examples:  * Millions of rapid tests are sitting unused (looking at BC) for strange reasons. False positives or false negatives, at least you'd catch more positives earlier on and push people to isolated and get a molecular test. * Failure to acknowledge the nature of spread of the virus resulting in additional cases. There needs to be an admission that this is an airborne virus and anything less than a N95 mask is like wearing nothing at all. Seriously, a cloth mask is at best 10% effective right now - citations can be found if necessary.  * Distributing proper PPE to each person free of charge. This is a relatively low-cost way of getting effective preventative tools in everyone's hands. It doesn't take two years to spin up production on these products. Prioritize the domestic production of the tools necessary to produce the masks.  * Focus on cases instead of instances of severe disease. The corporate adage, ""what gets measured gets managed,"" is entirely applicable in this pandemic. This sort of shifted with the vaccine passport, but the reimposition of restrictions on vaccinated individuals rejects the science that outcomes for vaccinated individuals are still excellent. If restrictions are to buy time for additional boosters (as the Dutch have stated) then suspending vaccine administration for a week is completely unacceptable. * BC is closing down vaccination locations for the holidays (Coastal Health is closed Dec 24 - Dec 28). I get that staff need a break, but during a surge we need all hands on deck to protect as many people as possible. Supply isn't an issue. We could even have dentists and naturopaths administering boosters if needed (creative solutions) * Failure to acknowledge several largely preventable or controllable comorbidities driving severe outcomes, such as: obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, smoking, substance abuse, etc.  Driving down rates of these conditions would mean fewer people in hospital and fewer people dying.  * Unnecessary cancellation of elective surgeries and preventative screenings. Several provinces cancelled these early on in the pandemic despite no surge in demand which has resulted in years long backlogs and excess deaths not directly caused by COVID. * Failure to properly fund an expansion of health care capacity (this is long term). Almost 3x the number of medical residency placements occurred in 2020 vs 2000, yet we continue to have severe shortages of primary care physicians. Anecdotally, family doctors are retiring without someone to take over their practice leaving patients without necessary care resulting in increased demand on emergency or high-cost services as conditions develop without being treated. * Tests for trips &lt;72 hours make no sense when the incubation period is longer (sometimes shorter for Omicron). You can't stop a citizen or PR from returning with a positive test at a land border, they just need a place to quarantine which is almost always their home.  I could go on, but none of these problems have even a hint of being addressed over the past two years. The result?

635,3,1639247883,"“With full vaccinated status” is a pretty big issue, don’t you think?  I’m going to tell you a very small and insignificant story for me, that was a much bigger deal to a small business owner I was trying to support.  This is my journey of growing a beard.  I decided to finally grow a beard during lockdown, something I have always wanted to do but never had the confidence to get through the ‘ugly’ growth stage.  But I decided to go for it.    Also happened to have a new barber open up just down the street in my small town who would help me maintain my new beard.  Perfect.  My barber has been closed down 3 times, he wasn’t eligible for any of the government assistance because his business was less than two years old.  And for a long time wasn’t able to trim my beard properly because I had to wear a mask the entire time.  That’s okay, this is a small inconvenience for me.  I can trim my own moustache.    But having him be closed every time I needed to go back in made my subpar beard trimming skills on the forefront, and really ended up hurting my entire year long effort of growing a beard.    Much more substantial to him and his wife and 5 kids though.  I did end up donating to the go fund me they made to try and save their business.  And then the masks.  Masks do not go well with long beards.  They cup around your chin and cause a prominent dent in the front of your well groomed, maintained and oiled beard.    This became insufferable for me.  I had bought many different styles of masks to try to get around this, but having to wear a mask at work 100% of the time (even while alone at my desk) it became an impossible task to keep my beard looking the way I wanted it to.    I ended up shaving it off.  I stopped going to my barber to support him, I still get nice texts from him and his wife asking me to come back, but until they can do their job consistently and properly, and until masks are a thing of the past, I just don’t see the point in trying to regrow my beard.    Now, if a man can’t decide to grow a beard without the government getting in his way, if something this small and inconsequential is full of so many road blocks and annoyances, I won’t consider myself free again.  If something this small is so changed and different from what it was in 2019, you can tell that everything in your life has changed and we worry it’ll never be allowed to go back to the way it was.  It’s been two years.  Sure, I didn’t get to enjoy a beard, but my poor barber is having his entire life ruined, and his wife’s and their 5 kids.  And just to continue the minutia of this example, I had realized my middle daughter had never had a banana split.  So I jumped into the car and drove her to Dairy Queen.  Ordered, and realized we couldn’t eat in without my vaccine passport.  Well, I had just changed phones and hadn’t moved all my photos onto my new phone, where my passport was.  Shit.  Oh, I think it’s in my emails.  Oh well, I hadn’t set up my emails on my new phone yet either.  Shit, well let me do that real quick.  Oh….. turns out I can’t remember my password, and my password manager is on my other phone too.  Shit, I changed phones and didn’t think that meant my “papers” weren’t with me.  Well, we ended up having to eat our banana splits in the car.  Not really the great daddy daughter experience I was going for.  Just a couple everyday small examples of things I’m about done with having to deal with.    The bigger things would be the fear I had when they took astra Zeneca off the market right after my wife had gotten her first shot.  And then the controversy over split vaccinations, and travel, and if she was at a health risk or if she would be able to go on vacation with me and our children if we decided to.  If we could travel to see my parents in the US.  The mental health issues of my small children, being separated from their friends at school, being scared to hug their grandparents, being told not to touch or show age toon to their friends, being cohorted and told seeing some friends at school is dangerous while other friends are fine.  Their mental health about getting sick, or getting their grandparents sick, walking across the street naturally when they see someone coming down the other end of the sidewalk.  My mother crying on the phone to me telling me she feels like a leper that we are told not to see her, telling me that a year for her youngest grandchild will cause her to not even remember who she is.  I mean, I could go on all day.  None of this is normal.  And I’m done with it.

Elliott said Monday there was always the understanding that the vaccine passport system could stay beyond the planned timeframe due to conditions in the province. “(It was) always subject to the caveat that if there was a situation such as a variant we don’t know about, and we don’t know what’s going to happen, we would have to re-evaluate.” NDP leader Andrea Horwath urged the government to “show strong leadership” and stop “pandering to anti-vaxxers” with what she called a premature planned removal of the vaccine passport system.***  ***“Doug Ford’s end date for vaccination certificates always was a dog whistle to anti-vaxers. Mr. Ford’s message is: it’s ok to wait it out instead of getting a vaccine,” she said in a statement issued after Question Period.***  ***The Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant first detected in South Africa has now spread to dozens of countries around the globe.***  ***Ontario public health officials have so far confirmed 11 cases of Omicron in the province, including seven in the GTHA.***",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/rafk7c/covid19_vaccine_passports_not_likely_to_recede_in/hnhw8em/

657,2,1638615260,"Vaccine passports are to punish the unvaccinated and make their lives unpleasant.  Government officials have admitted this.  One example is Patricia Daly, Chief Medical Health Officer for Vancouver Coastal Health   [https://youtu.be/Z1NlhQGVAhw?t=932](https://youtu.be/Z1NlhQGVAhw?t=932)      ""The vaccine passport requires people to be vaccinated to do certain discretionary activities such as go to restaurants, movies, gyms, not because these places are high risk.

""Whereas healthcare workers, who may have had covid and been in the infectious stage unknowingly might have had contact with more people.""          ""So visitors are actually low risk to introduce virus into a facility. They're screened, they're putting on a mask.

658,0,1638537943,"I'm seeing some lazy accusations and reactionary comments here already (quelle surprise), so I think I need to separate the valid and problematical arguments that the writer lays out.  &gt;The government, of course, will never walk back its emergency powers of its own volition. And why would they? After two years of fomenting terror and division among the population, they have cultivated a solid base of support that combines the post-9/11 see-something-say-something paranoia of a middle-class yuppie with the unctuous 1980s Moral Majority sense of superiority.  This is excessive. The tone of these words weakens the entire piece, even if I have seen some of this tendency for myself.  &gt;Yet, in Ontario, even as the province exceeded by weeks its vaccination and case number targets of the government's phased reopening plan, citizens were offered only breadcrumbs in return: moving up Phase 3 reopening by just a few days, with no plans at the time for a complete reopening.  The tone of this comment is unhelpful. It's not a matter of ""breadcrumbs"" and rewards from the government.  &gt;that exposes the flaw inherent in governments' COVID response: for nearly two years, debate and dissent from burdensome COVID restrictions has been short-circuited with demands that citizens ""trust the science""; a modern take on debate-defusing exhortations to ""support our troops"" during the War on Terror.  I totally agree that there is a huge tendency on the part of very loud people to shut down debate, to label anyone who raises questions as ""anti-vax"" (what was it that Orwell said about political speech and monosyllables, again?). You have only to read countless threads on r/canada to see that. That being said...  As a student in the physical sciences, I find the writer takes the analogy too far here. Yes, I'm biased, but ""trust the science"" is not as atavistic and dishonest as ""support the troops"". I completely agree that science is not meant for simple-minded slogans like that - anyone who has really tried to do science, to generate verifiable knowledge, knows all about doubt, debate and criticism. So, as problematic as it is to silence people by saying ""trust the silence"", it doesn't shut down debate like the spectre of military action.  &gt;It was a precipitous but inevitable shift from ""two weeks to flatten the curve"" to get the jab or lose your job, and unsurprisingly, there is still more to come. Met the provincial vaccination targets? Great; but now it's time for a booster. Ready for the ""temporary"" vaccine passport system to expire? Sorry, we need to extend it through spring ...  There is a certain amount of flexibility and patience that is required of us to wrestle the pandemic down, so I cannot agree with the general tenor of this comment.  &gt;Less than a year ago, government and public health officials touted vaccination as a panacea to end the pandemic. It's safe, effective and will allow the country to put COVID behind us, we were told.  Getting warmer. I find that many of the public health pronouncements have had a profoundly infantilizing air, and that since before March of 2020 (I'm thinking of the WHO, particularly).  &gt;Every infringement on citizens' privacy, mobility, autonomy and conscience rights has been justified by officials in the name of the infallible technocratic might of ""the science."" But when proven wrong – or more importantly, unpopular at the polls – that formerly rock-solid science on which officials acted is simply dismissed out of hand. Policymakers, however, cannot on one hand demand unyielding adherence to science, and then down the road simply hand-wave away their previous demands on the grounds that their knowledge or political fortunes have evolved.  No argument here.  &gt;It is for this precise reason that checks and balances exist in governance: to prevent rule through unaccountable technocratic appeals to authority. Debate and dissent in the age of COVID, however, have become four-letter words.   &gt;   &gt;Our public health officials and elected politicians should not at this point expect any benefit of the doubt. Considering that we are still taking our shoes off and binning bottles of water at airport security 20 years after 9/11, that government officials and their unelected mandarins are unwilling to cede their newfound power in an age of COVID should not come as any surprise.  Here our privacy lawyer is arguing on his best ground. I challenge anyone to provide a rebuttal to these statements.  &gt;As the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) once knew, ""There will always be a new disease, always the threat of a new pandemic."" Accordingly, the number of boosters, or the percentage of fully-vaccinated citizens, needed for a return to normal will always be n+1. Meet one metric, and be met with two more. As the ACLU continues, ""If fear of disease justifies the suspension of liberties and the institution of an emergency state, then freedom and the rule of law will be permanently suspended.""   &gt;   &gt;Already we see public health officials priming the pump for the next goalpost shift. Even if vaccine uptake is high among five to 11-year-olds, it will still not be good enough. According to Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, toddlers under the age of four will be next to need the shots, claiming with an absolute lack of shame that – unlike all the other times we were promised an end to the pandemic – vaccinating that group will be a ""turning point.""  I don't need to accuse Theresa Tam or any other official of conspiracy theories or dark motives in order to agree here. Public health officials in Canada have been undermining and short-circuiting themselves in a number of ways since March of 2020. The sense of scrambling, the subtly-conveyed lack of foresight they've evinced, has not been encouraging. But their refusal to provide a **firm, science-based set of conditions our society needs to meet in order to safely remove a given restriction** is troubling - alarming - in precisely the way this lawyer states. The authoritarian and hateful turn to subs like r/canada and r/ontario seals it for me. Why do public health and federal political officials refuse to come out and say that measures like vaccine passports and travel restrictions are temporary, and will expire after a set (and relatively short, but renewable) period?  I am fully-vaccinated, and I intend to get a booster upon consulting with my doctor. I ""trust the science"" because it has been shown to work. What I do not, and cannot, trust, are politicians wielding self-conferred authority that they have never had before... especially not in the 21st century. Security theatre has been shown *not* to work. While some of our privacy laywer's prose is alarmist and ineffective, I cannot condemn this article.

701,4,1637700974,"&gt;This has nothing to do with the efficacy of the vaccine. My question was specifically if the same tactic (threatened job loss, denied healthcare) was used to enforce something you don't agree with, like say forced weightloss for the obese or forced drug rehab with mandatory testing for addicts. The more general question would be: is it acceptable to use such tactics in any case whether or not you agree with the issue at hand. To dumb it down is it ok to play dirty if the outcome is just and worthy.  It has all to do with the efficacy of the vaccine.  It is proven to prevent a flood of unneedless deaths within our hospitals.  However those who choose not to do it for whatever reason they deem, is still indirectly killing others who have no choice but to rely on our hospital system and care.  I have no idea why you want to compare or somewhat equate the plight of obesity or drug addiction to those that don't want to take a vaccine. Ok I'll bite.   Should those people lose their jobs? If their actions **do not** affect those in the workplace, no. If they do, then yes they absolutely should not have their job. I wouldn't want to work next to someone operating heavy machinery while under the influence.  That's why jobs have drug and alcohol testing. If someone is obese should they lose their job? If it's a firefighter responsible for rescuing people, maybe...if they can't meet the physical requirements of the job they shouldn't fill that position. If it's an overweight clerk at a law firm, absolutely not. Their obesity does not affect those around them at their place of work.  Should either of these cases be denied health care?  No. Our hospital have the capacity to handle these two cases, they don't with the surge of unvaccinated COVID victims that come in due to their own inaction.  Equating drug addicts or obesity with someone who doesn't want to be vaccinated is a poor poor argument.  &gt;Mandating a health procedure like this and forcing people to disclose health information to non health professionals (i.e. your job or a bartender) bring up serious societal, legal and moral issues that people like you are just plain ignoring.

709,4,1637287088,"&gt;Obesity is more damaging than long Covid  I've been seeing this quite a bit lately which leads me to suspect it's the new narrative being pushed from certain propaganda outlets.  You can't compare obesity to an infectious disease. It just isn't the same thing. Sure obesity can result in a lot of health complications and is a significant factor in a lot of health problems and deaths.  But being in the same room with a person who is obese does not put you at risk of being obese.  The vast majority of deaths during this 4th wave (and the 3rd wave) were more or less preventable. Alberta's asinine ""Best Summer Ever"" policy where they blew the doors off of any restrictions just as delta was making its way into the province, and then firing 1/2 of their contact tracers and ceasing contact tracing in schools had an entirely predictable (and preventable) outcome.  I'm not saying that there needed to be a complete lockdown and people needed to be confined to their homes (which is usually the next thing anti-mask/anti-vax/anti-sensible policy advocates accuse people of whenever it comes up), but bringing in a vaccine passport system and ramping up contact tracing/isolation protocols would have kept the numbers low, kept hospitals from being overwhelmed, and allowed the majority of people and businesses to actually have ""The Best Summer Ever.""

Also this has to include that Ontario and Quebec(our most populace provinces), were hit hardest at the beginning of COVID, and for the longest time had the toughest restrictions were promised this as a way out of restrictions for the vaccinated, and being able to visit family again.

Because, as you said, the point is to get out of this emergency situation and natural immunity is variable, it makes more sense to just vaccinate (there's really zero reason not to). The logistics, time, and costs of testing everyone who's been previously infected - and keep testing them - would be counterproductive. In this case, the effective and time-sensitive route we have is mass vaccination. (It's also important to remember that while vaccinated individuals can still spread COVID, they are doing so at a much lesser rate.)  If we weren't in the middle of a pandemic, an immunity passport would be more feasible. HCW already have skin, titer, and antibody tests done for other viruses to determine whether there is further need for vaccination. We just don't have the time for this.  Do I wish that mandates were necessary? No. But there has been so much disinformation spread about COVID and the vaccines - and HCW should really know better - so here we are...

So I think I'm on safe ground here.  &gt;Neither of those things prevent people from participating freely in society.   While smokers want to smoke, they absolutely are restricted. Just as children are restricted from legally buying or serving or being served alcohol. The unvaxxed are simply engaging in their controlled activity (being unvaxxed) in a wider way than smokers or minors and alcohol. So they feel the restrictions more so.  &gt;It's one thing to be offered a treatment and have a choice,   Lol. I can't believe you think having a serious medical condition is comparable to being unvaxxed. The vast majority of people who have medical conditions didn't choose to have the them.   &gt;it's another to be required by the state to take it or be excluded from society.

The point is, if an employer fires someone for stealing, then it's the employer who made the decision to get rid of the employee. The employee didn't choose to quit or stop working.  In this case, the employees didn't choose to stop working or quit. The employers chose to fire them for being unvaccinated.  And make no mistake, it was indeed their choice. Not that of the employees'.   We can look at Quebec where today they made a different choice and chose not to fire unvaccinated workers, thus not causing surgeries to be cancelled as a result.

That being said they are designed to get people to do something they are unwilling to do when it is in the best intrest of the country and its vulnerable sector.   You are also using spread and transmission  interchangeably. Vaccines do lower transmission which thus lowers the ability of a virus to spread. Without referencing mandates vaccines absolutely do lower transmission and by cause spread.   As you said the passport doesn't do that. But it is literally a reward system to do the what is best for the society as a whole. You won't be forced to get the vaccine but the passport ensures you will be rewarded for doing so.  This could have been over a long time ago if people would just get the vaccine. Exemptions are personal and should not have even been discussed in media.

There's extremely high public support for them (78% in favor) and the more the vaccination rate climbs, the less opposition there is (because basically everyone will have one anyway). A lot of people see the vaccine passport as something that *enables* them to get back to a normal-ish life, without worrying about the people around them potentially getting them sick. Provincial governments have presented the passports as an alternative to having to go into an (unpopular) lockdown again.

848,0,1634677817,"&gt; What is the goal of the passport policy that excludes unvaccinated people when vaccinated people can and do contract and spread covid-19?  Because I *have* to believe that nobody's this stupid, I have to assume that the person above me is arguing in good faith. For the benefit of anyone else reading this who's interested in something other than a trolling gish gallop...  **Vaccinated invididuals *can* contract and spread Covid, but they're far less likely to contract it in the first place, and those who do get infected will be far less likely to infect others.** ""Herd immunity"" relies on adding an immunized layer of insulation at each potential vector point, and anti-vax trolls like to pretend that ""the vaccine isn't *perfectly* effective at protecting an individual"" is the same thing as ""the vaccine is useless at reducing spread in a society.""  If you have unvaxxed freeloaders crammed into the same public space as you, it *significantly* increases risk. On top of that, those are the *exact* people who are generally most likely to be cramming into large indoor gatherings surrounded by other unvaccinated anti-science types.  This has been explained to the user above me several times, [at least once with source data](https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/pxtoqm/deadlines_loom_for_hundreds_of_unvaccinated/hev9wh1/).

In the meanwhile, I'm happy to know that it's reasonably safe to finally enjoy a reopening *because* the restaurant around the corner is excluding covidiots. Now let's start treating it like underage drinking, and actually fining the hell out of malfeasant establishments.

The logical end of your argument is ""if you do not do healthy living perfectly, you're wasting healthcare resources"", but YES, freedom is more important than that, healthcare system be damned.  &gt;You might be surprised to learn this but during a pandemic with a novel virus there are going to be periods when more restrictions are necessary and periods when fewer restrictions are necessary.  My point is, they're not necessary and you've been happy having your chain jerked.  &gt;Indeed, we've seen repeated evidence from around the planet that when cases begin to rise, there is approximately a two week delay before the impact of restrictions start to take effect and we begin to see a plateau in case numbers or hospitalizations  We've actually seen a fair bit of evidence that lockdowns had little effect, other than making people feel like the state was doing something, at least.  &gt;Have you been vaccinated yet?  Actually, considering how tyrannical the government has been, and considering that I already have natural immunity from catching covid myself, I'm going to pass on the mRNA vaccines. I already know what locations in town are silently resisting the vax passport bullshit, and I go there. If the government ever actually approves a more traditional style vaccine, I will consider getting one of those. But considering that my experience with covid was not worse than a headcold, I don't actually care anymore.

906,10,1634153035,"Premise in general. Originally, it was meant to be a pandemic, which we did our best to get past, then move on.  This passport system has a VERY real chance, of being something that lasts for years. Being constantly reminded of a lingering threat that could kill you every time you go out to eat. Subconsciously, I believe this has a huge effect on people. Especially people who grow up in a world where ""showing your papers"" is the norm. Leaves future people susceptible to more draconian rules without pushback, since they have never known better.  I know people bring up ""Showing ID at a bar"" all the time. But that is totally different.   Showing identification to prove you are a certain age to meet a law is very different from ""proving you are a bit less likely to be carrying a deadly illness""  Lastly, ( At least in my province ) I don't like how basically the day this rule went into effect, the numbers started dropping. It leaves room for people to think ""Oh, the passport system worked!"" , when in reality the numbers were falling anyway. Despite being vaccinated, this whole system has driven a wedge between my family that may never be removed. Im double vaccinated, my brother is not. My family wants to ban him from Christmas Dinner because of it. To me, that is FUCKING INSANE. I could never have imagined that my family could straight up abandon my brother because he didn't get a vaccination, for an illness with a 0.1% death rate, that my parents are ALREADY VACCINATED FOR.  This level of fear in society might never go back to normal. The passport system gives the ""illusion"" of a safer world to those out there who are still afraid. But its not entirely unknown that A : Life involves taking a certain amount of risk, and B : The best way to overcome your fears, is to face them.  If the vaccine passport system was optional? I would have a different tone. But its not, Check peoples cards or NO INDOOR DINING? How the fuck is a restaurant even supposed to have a choice? If it was optional, at least I could take my business elsewhere, but for now, I cant.  I refuse to go anywhere that requires passports, and will continue this practice until they are removed. It shows a change of culture in this country that I do not wish to be a part of. If it continues into the second half of next year, my family and I will very much consider moving.

CBC News agreed not to name the official in order to inform the public in advance of the announcement.*  *Ontario has been at Step 3 of what the government calls its ""Roadmap to Reopen"" since mid-July. The official said it's now time to unveil a ""revised pandemic plan"" that takes into account the province's success in getting the population vaccinated against COVID-19, while also keeping a lid on the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus.*  *""We owe people a clear plan to exit the roadmap,"" the official said in an interview. ""The work began months ago, we are finalizing the plan now and we expect to release it late next week.""*  *The Ontario government will not lift all public health measures and ""pretend the pandemic is over,"" said the official, noting that indoor-masking requirements will remain in place.*  *However, the plan will signal when physical distancing and capacity limits can be lifted in settings where proof of vaccination is not required, such as places of worship, the official said.*  *The plan will also indicate conditions that would prompt the government to reimpose restrictions, on a targeted and local basis, should any significant spike in new infections emerge.*  *The official declined to state which day next week the plan will be announced, nor to give a specific date of when the relaxed measures will take effect. The government has previously said Ontario's digital proof-of-vaccination app will launch on Oct. 22, which is Friday of next week.*  *News that more restrictions will be lifted comes as Ontario is seeing an average of 500 new cases of COVID-19 daily. That seven-day average figure has trended steadily downward since Sept. 5, despite the resumption of school for the province's two million elementary and secondary students.*  *The fact that in-person classes returned without producing a spike in the province's overall number of cases is one key reason why the government believes the time is right for exiting Step 3 of the roadmap, the official said.*  *Other key factors are the province's vaccination rate and little evidence of virus transmission at locations where Ontario's vaccine-passport system has been in place since Sept. 22.*  *The latest provincial figures show 83 per cent of Ontarians aged 12 and up are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and another five per cent have received one dose of a vaccine.*  *""We've watched and learned lessons from other provinces that moved too quickly to open up,"" the official said. ""We're going to continue to be cautious.""*  *However, the official acknowledges it ""was a mistake"" for the government to announce the lifting of capacity limits for spectator sports venues, cinemas and theatres, without announcing its plan for restaurants, bars and gyms. That news came late on the Friday afternoon before the long weekend.*  *The move benefited Ontario's NHL teams by giving the Toronto Maple Leafs the chance to play their home opener before capacity crowds on Wednesday night, and the Ottawa Senators able to play theirs on Thursday.But it left restaurant owners seething.*  *Members of the Ford government and Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Kieran Moore had previously indicated that the main goal for Ontario is to avoid further lockdowns, and that any future tightening of measures would be tailored toward reining in local outbreaks, with the aim of minimizing disruption to people's lives.*  *The new plan will include guidance about travel and more specifics about when the province will transition the proof-of-vaccination program from mandatory to voluntary, said the official. ""Ontarians will have a better idea of what they can expect in the months ahead as we continue to confront COVID-19,"" the official added.*  *The current description of Ontario's reopening plan on the province's website indicates that ""the majority of public health measures in effect under Step 3 will be lifted"" when Ontario moves to the next phase of its pandemic response.*  *The website says that would include removing capacity limits in all sectors and removing requirements for active screening of patrons and workers.*",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/q7m25d/ontarios_new_plan_for_lifting_covid19/hgjgewj/

They were on the front lines, dealing with the public during the pandemic,” he said.  “They had to fight for minimal health and safety precautions, dealt with overwhelmed and angry customers who took their own anxieties around the pandemic out on them.”  READ MORE: ‘We weren’t thinking about other people’: Unvaccinated Alberta man on his time in ICU with COVID-19  Payne said Superstore rolled out “hero pay” but “clawed” it back, even as the chain profited.

There are a wide variety of issues that are causing the frustration expressed by Superstore union members’ 97 per cent strike vote last week, from wages to benefits to scheduling and beyond,” he said.  “But if there is a unifying theme to that anger and frustration, it is feeling like they just don’t matter.”  TWEET THIS CLICK TO SHARE QUOTE ON TWITTER: ""BUT IF THERE IS A UNIFYING THEME TO THAT ANGER AND FRUSTRATION, IT IS FEELING LIKE THEY JUST DON'T MATTER.""

It reduces the likelihood of them spreading the disease to schoolmates and family.   &gt;   &gt;In other words, natural immunity in Canada isn't enough to get us into that magic 80-88% range.  Agreed, which furthers my point that natural immunity is another tool in our toolkit that can help us get out of this faster. So long as at-risk contacts have been vaccinated then that natural spread can be beneficial (hence why Denmark's vaccine passport included 2x vax shots OR a positive covid test - and  recovery - that's no older than six months).

I already provided justification for it: to encourage people to get a free, life-saving vaccine in order to finally bring the pandemic to an end. You have yet to articulate a coherent argument against a vaccine passport.   &gt;And it will never be normal again because your irrational vaccine passport system is never going away.  You have zero evidence of this. Baseless speculation. The vaccine passport will go away once the pandemic ends. Why? Because Canada is a democratic society based on the rule of law, and once the public health crisis reaches an end, limiting peoples' freedoms will no longer be legally justifiable. If you seriously think that we're heading towards a fascist state, then you're delusional.  &gt;And you're penalizing them for it.  Entering a private business is not a right, it's a privilege. If someone insists on jeopardizing public health by foregoing a free life-saving vaccine (without having a valid medical exemption), then it's only natural that they be denied entry to certain non-essential private businesses in order to mitigate community spread. If the unvaccinated don't want to be inconvenienced by these public health measures, then all they have to do is go and get vaccinated. Not hard.  &gt;How is it not a ranson?  It's not a ransom for a very simple reason. Nobody is being denied the right to live if they refuse to get the shot. Nobody is being held captive.

It is simply allowing those of us that have done bare minimum this whole time to fight this pandemic the ability to maintain some semblance of normalcy.   The unvaccinated want their cake and to eat it too. If we allow them to have their way no one will have any cake. Across the country surgeries are being postponed and canceled, quality of care is dropping, Healthcare staff is being pushed to the brink and forced to carry unfair and unsafe workloads. And what is the response from the people who did the worst job handling this pandemic? $100 cards for people who get the vaccine, some companies are paying for their unvaccinated employees to get tested every 72 hours now. We are all paying for this, we pay for it with our impacted quality of life and the increase health care costs and the stress to our important health care workers. We pay for it directly in the $100 cards.

Immunity from a vaccine is not 100%, nor is it guaranteed.   The primary benefit is the population level herd immunity.

1097,14,1632859368,"&gt; you want the government to decide who gets life saving care.   That's not what I proposed. Everyone gets the life-saving healthcare. People who chose not to get vaccinated just have to pay full cost for it. That's totally fair. Far better than forcing the entire country to comply with the horrifyingly authoritarian proposal of a vaccine passport that makes even going to the grocery store a matter of proving one's legitimacy.  There has to be a line. Driving, drinking alcohol, and consuming drugs have legitimate reasons for why individuals should provide certification to demonstrate their ability to responsibly handle the situation. Getting vaccinated only requires sitting in a chair and is not something that bears an urgent responsibility towards oneself other people.  The vaccine passport, on the other hand, is a demonstration that an individual is *not* part of the bad crowd. You can't possibly claim that entering a grocery store or seeing a movie is a genuine reason to believe that an individual might bring harm to others and must demonstrate proof of safety. The social and psychological ramifications involved in that difference are akin to the difference to living in a free society versus an authoritarian regime. ""I'm afraid of you driving a car"" is a fair position to take. ""I'm afraid of you going to the deli"" is a nightmare.   The best way to convince people to do something is to make them think it's their own idea. Making people who already made the right decision prove that they are _not_ part of the problem does not succeed in that regard, and that's how paranoid and authoritarian societies flourish.  If people knew that our healthcare system is so strained that being unvaccinated could lead them to incur tens of thousands of dollars in medical expenses, then I'm pretty sure a lot of the so-called freedom-fighter anti-vaxx types would realize pragmatically that they can't afford the price of their crusade, and they would swallow their pride and just get the vaccine, and their LARPing would quickly come to an end, and science would win again. And if they didn't? Fine, they can complain on social media that they have to pay out the ass for treatment, and their anti-vaxx crusader friends would secretly get their asses to the clinic for a shot.  The critical difference is that what I'm proposing puts the impetus on the individuals involved, while your suggestion of a QR code passport makes every single Canadian, regardless of any kind of status, beholden to the choices of other individuals. I don't see that as remotely fair. This isn't some kind of double-think.  God this was long. If you actually sat through this, I commend you.  *I'm sure there are generous supporters among the right-wing/anti-vaxx crowd who could provide charity for those who need help. After all, if it's really not that great a risk to go unvaccinated, and most people don't get hospitalized, then the financial risk of giving money to everyone who needs help should not be that great.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/px5x50/we_werent_thinking_about_other_people/hemwzmx/

Your threat of thousands of dollars in medical bills means nothing because they don't think it is possible to be hospitalized.   We have had 19 months of ""putting the responsibility on the individual"" and it hasn't worked. An enforced vaccine passport can get us through the worst of this by keeping unvaxxed people home and/or getting them vaxxed. The small day to day inconveniences will be a bigger incentive than the threat of medical bills.  And in say a year, we probably won't need the passport anymore.

Your method of charging people does nothing to alleviate the current crisis though. It will only marginally impact vaccination rates and our healthcare system will continue to suffer. Under your method the hospitals will stay full until virtually all of the unvaxxed people have caught covid. At the current rate of infection that could take over a year, and at a 0.8% ICU rate, could lead to an extra 8,000 people in the ICU over that time. Keep in mind we usually have only 173 ICU beds, so there would be no healthcare capacity.  &gt;Then there's no way to convince them anyway.  There is a way. Vaccine passport announcements have double or tripled the rate of vaccinations everywhere they were announced. And if you have effective enforcement that trend will only increase as they aren't allowed to go to restaurants, hockey games, concerts, bars, or other recreational activities. Those are the inconveniences I am talking about. Showing your phone at those events isn't really an inconvenience compared to not being allowed to go.  If this pandemic has proven anything, it is that the people who are unvaxxed will not just stay home. It will be the tipping point for most people if they can't go out and do things.

Small businesses had hoped the new regime would be coupled with a relaxation of indoor capacity limits, since all patrons would be fully vaccinated.*        *Instead, on Friday afternoon, the province announced capacity limits would increase only for very large venues, such as the Rogers Centre, where up to 30,000 fans can now watch the Toronto Blue Jays play.*        *“If you’re a gym owner and you’re still at 50-per-cent capacity come January, February, when you traditionally get that big New Year’s resolution crowd coming in, that will be crushing,” said Ryan Mallough, senior director of provincial affairs for Ontario with the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.*        *In Alberta, businesses such as restaurants and recreation centres were given a choice starting Sept. 20: to either opt in to the Restrictions Exemption Program and ask customers aged 12 and older for proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test, or keep indoor activities closed or severely limited (depending on the type of activity).*        *Businesses were given just a few days to decide.

By keeping those people most likely to lead to an outbreak out of those places you decrease the chances of that outbreak occurring, help slow the spread, and help decrease the hospitalizations.  If people would go and get the vaccine we could be done with this fucking garbage rather than it lingering around like it is.

If you are requiring vaccines it has to be all or none, as anti-vaxxers have been a problem for a lot longer than covid has been a problem, so if you are only now saying that a vaccine is important you should say they all are (as there have been cases in the past, especially amongst the children of anti-vaxxers where diseases long since gone sprouted up again in daycares and such). That’s just my personal reasoning for being against the passport though.  Some people say “covid is a lot more serious than the other vaccines though” but the reason we have these vaccines is because is WAS a really serious issue wayyyyy back when, and we solved it.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/puy0ew/antivaxxers_dont_have_a_right_to_accommodations/he9dvjk/

But *you* wanted to look at recent numbers so we did. If you now want to look accross the entire pandemic then yeah that's different. As for why Quebec has higher deaths per capita (0.047% of their population has positive cases) vs alberta (0.05%) oh look at that, quebec *doesn't* have higher cases per capita and you were flat out mistaken. How about that 5:1 ratio you ""read about"" eh? Maybe get your numbers from official sources instead of facebook memes.   &gt;We'll all be getting overwhelmed by Delta soon enough.  You realize delta is in every province right? Only Alberta is getting overwhelmed by it. Can't possibly imagine why that would be though 🤔   &gt;Were you saying all this before Japan was hit, when literally every media outlet was predicting mass death in Japan?  Really? Who was predicting mass death in Japan? They prevented covid from ever really getting a foothold by having tough border security and isolating positive cases. But please keep comparing an island nation to one sharing the largest land border in the world to the worst hit country in the world.

Why is alberta in a state of emergency while other provinces have seen numbers drop?   &gt;If our powerhungry leaders had properly staffed and funded our hospitals and if our healthcare system was functional we wouldn't have an overflowing ICU.  An under-performing medical system is an even greater argument for restrictions to prevent it from being overwhelmed.   &gt;Even bad flu seasons have caused our ICU capacity to overflow so of course COVID, which is way more infectious, will be even worse than that.  Right, so for something wildy more contagious it has an even greater chance to overwhelm ICU capacity. Maybe we should treat it differently then 🤔   &gt;Lockdowns do nothing except ensure that fewer people acquire natural immunity so the inevitable spike will be worses.   Lockdowns ensure it doesn't spread as fast as it can and overwhelm our already struggling medical facilities. Im confused by your logic. You acknowledge our medical system is understaffed and under funded, yet you think covid should be allowed to run rampant and overwhelm it.   &gt;Vaccine passports are useless too.  Not if they pressure more people to get vaccinated. A vaccinated individual is much less likely to require ICU care for their case meaning less strain on our medical system. You know, the medical system which you pointed out needs all the help it can get.   &gt;The only end result of Israel's passport and vaccination campaign is that the hospitals are overflowing with vaccinated old unhealthy people instead of unvaccinated old unhealthy people.

She watched the global news video of Charlene in the hospital in Victoria stating from her bed and through her tubes that she wished that she had gotten it.  Charlene did not sound like an antivaxxer.  Charlene had leukaemia as a child and became scared of a bad reaction after reading stuff on the internet.  Charlene said that there is no toughing it out.  Spouse responded that since I cared about it so much that she will talk with her doctor about it.  Ya.

1219,8,1632654786,"Agreed, I am truly not convinced the vaccine passports actually work to reduce transmission overall in the community (honest question - has there been any data proving it does?)   First problem I see is children: they spend all day in a congregate setting with other unvaccinated (school)… which makes them probably much more likely to have the virus or be a vector than the average person. Yet, they are allowed in any venue which would be denied to a non-vaccinated adult. Until everyone is able to get vaccinated, you really can’t think of vaccine passport zones as “just the vaccinated”, but as “just the vaccinated and the most likely unvaccinated carriers of the virus”.   Second problem I see: unvaccinated people (who have decided they’re not going to get the vaccine) are locked out of social venues, but it doesn’t mean they’re going to not socialize. They will just do it in homes and other settings that are less safe than places with covid restrictions.   Because of these two reasons I’m not convinced that vaccines passports actually reduce the community transmission. Would love to see data to the opposite if I’m wrong.

One of the things that shows to me the major motivation of this is to spite the unvaccinated is the fact that the option to be vaccinated OR show a negative test is so unpopular with the vaccine passport lobby.   For example, in Ontario, a teacher has to either be vaccinated or be tested twice a week for covid. But there are lots of people who criticize the government for not “mandating vaccines for teachers” because of this caveat about allowing negative tests. Similarly, I know there used to be sporting venues (not sure if they still exist) where you could show a negative test result from the day of or a proof of vaccination… but this allowance of negative tests has been very unpopular among the pro-vaccine passport folk.   Why? I have to think it’s what you said… they want the unvaccinated to be shamed, and not allowed into places just out of spite.

1250,4,1632429212,"But there is a problem.  O'Tooles ""moderate"" message was all message and no fact.  I am reading all these comments and committments about a policy review and a moderate platform.  Its complete fiction and the surface of it was designed to obfuscate the the real positions of the Conservative party:  * O'Toole was personally ""pro-choice"" but nowhere in the party platform anywhere will you find it specify it was such.  In fact my recollection is that in the past  he said he would respect any private member bills which advocated for abortion restrictions.  The party is anti-abortion and no sugar coating is going to get around that.  It allows its sitting members to formally advocate for abortion restrictions and anti-abortion policy. * Gun control.  Well we already know the facts as they intended to remove some restrictions. * Child Care:  the tax credit proposal was classic trickle down economics.  The Liberal policy would result in a person paying $220 a month for child care per child - assuming 22 days a month.  No matter how much gloss one put on the Conservative policy the best outcome would have seen a monthly child care cost several times that figure.  And you had to hope for reimbursement in arrears vs knowing a stable up front cost.  And had no money to actually build out more spots but worked on the premise that demand for child care would increase and the private sector would build out spots accordingly.  A defacto subsidization of the private sector. * Climate Change.  Another bomb per the party formally deciding not to recognize climate change as being real.  The plan has some real environmental points I liked but whether they would actually be implemented? * All things covid.  Again let us remember O'Tooles effusive praising of Kenney and his refusal to take it back.  This was a coded message to Conservative supporters that he and the party did not support vaccine passport mandates or other restrictions to control the spread of covid.  Look carefully at O'Tooles many talking points on covid.  He talked a lot and said very little, and never advocated for restrictions or controls.   Their covid plan is mostly ""post covid"" measures.  If one reads the [Conservative Platform](https://cpcassets.conservative.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08200659/e4cd8c0115c3ea0.pdf) it has a number of  good economic points in it but when its very much devoid of social policy or any immediately effective covid policy.  And again much of the economics is tax credit based plan and on some important points it is ""encourage"" this or ""study"" that but not actual commitments to change.  So I find it very humourous to read all the recent pronouncements by Conservatives that they will have a policy convention and so on to examine what and why.  Well the what and why is sugar coating matters so you can sit on the fence did not work with the educated electorate.

It to-date has zero exploits, had an extremely small footprint (power, space, etc) and was extremely easy to set up and use (just install, if you get a positive test, you're given an unlock code and notifications are pushed to recipients). The best we have for passports is, from the [Ontario website](https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/1000779/ontario-to-require-proof-of-vaccination-in-select-settings),  &gt; Ontarians currently have access to a paper or PDF vaccine receipt that includes all relevant information to prove that they are fully vaccinated.  They promise more, with no timeline or commitment,  &gt; Ontario will also introduce an enhanced digital vaccine receipt that features a QR code, which is safe, more secure and with you wherever you go. This digital vaccine receipt can be kept on a phone and easily used to show that you've been vaccinated if you need to. In addition, the province will launch a new app to make it easier and more convenient for businesses and organizations to read and verify that a digital vaccine receipt is valid, while protecting your privacy.  A PDF is not secure, is not verifiable and is not convenient. This is a hack, to legislate the requirement without the framework is setup for failure.  I will disclaim, I am strongly in favour of vaccine passports, my disappointment comes from not being able to effectively do it. I'm average, I wasn't in the early wave of vaccines for elderly/healthcare, I wasn't a special edge case in a remote community, I'm from a big city and had all my documentation with me when I went to get it.

I showed how your claim is resting on an objectively false premise through the link that demonstrates a couple things:  It shows that laws do not “always expand” to give greater government power over individuals. It also shows that the government regularly updates or removes amendments - including removing amendments that grant broader powers to government.  “Once it’s in, it’s never removed” …It’s important to understand that the Act allowing the vaccine passport to exist is an amendment to an already existing Act. It’s not a brand new law that is now “in”, it is a modification to an existing law.  No one should reasonably expect governments to completely eliminate an entire Act to remove a single amendment. That would unnecessarily consume huge amounts of time and resources -  at the taxpayers expense. Instead portions major Acts get repealed or amended.  So yes.

At the very least, this would prevent the imposition of vaccine passport requirements on citizens — vaccinated or otherwise — for travelling, let alone while accessing basic services: for most charter rights are fundamental. Quebec’s programme and the Trudeau Liberals’ recent federal vaccine mandate for flights and trains, thus, ought to be dismissed.  It really doesn't seem that cut and dry that any of this would violate the charter.   If the rule is the same for everyone, then everyone is receiving equal protection before the law.

Getting on a plane has never been considered an inalienable right. If you don't pay for a ticket you can be prevented from flying. If you show up naked or black out drunk, you can be prevented from flying. Requiring a vaccine doesn't seem fundamentally different to me. No shirt, no shoes, no vax, no service.

While the Code prohibits discrimination based on creed, personal preferences or singular beliefs do not amount to a creed for the purposes of the Code.

People with strong immunity to Covid (most easily measured by antibody count), or do we want to simply reward people for getting vaccinated even if they didn’t develop the necessary antibodies to protect themselves and other better?  Both. We want to ensure those who are participating in higher risk activities have low Covid risk, and we want to ensure that people aren't incentivized to seek antibodies through infection. The latter would the make hospital capacity crisis that exists in places like Alberta worse, as many people that assume they'd have mild cases actually won't.  &gt; Shouldn’t a vaccine passport be granted to those who can prove they have antibodies above a certain threshold to fight off COVID if it is indeed a spectrum (which I agree with)? That seems the more scientific measurement of immunity.  It simply isn't feasible to test everyone's antibody levels. There's also not one single antibody. How do we weigh the broader less variant-specific antibodies of vaccination against the antibodies from infection? The science just isn't certain enough yet to tell us.  But making access to indoor dining dependent in vaccination is easy to do, and the scientific evidence clearly favours vaccination for everyone except a narrow set of medical exemptions (including those who have previously had Covid).",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/ptbuux/172_windsor_ont_hospital_staff_suspended_without/he03aci/

I’d recommend you see a doctor but they have their hands busy at the moment.  &gt; We now know the vaccines lose effectiveness rather quickly (6-9 months or so I believe).  Not dramatically. Today the FDA issued guidance for Pfizer booster shots for people over the age of 65, and only that demographic. “Losing efficiency” can mean a drop from 95% - 90%. They’re doing what they’re supposed to do - keep people largely out of hospitals.  &gt; So now the passport system is going to require people continually pump boosters into their arm just so they can interact with other human beings.  Hyperbolic nonsense.  &gt; We also know there are rare but serious side effects of the vaccine and if a person continually requires a booster then they have to roll the dice every single time hoping they dont develop one of the side effects.  Rare side effects of the vaccines are not remotely comparable to common Covid outcomes. You’re just interpreting data to suit your pre-existing perspective.   I assume I’m wasting my breath. But I’d rather do that than fight for it in an ICU because “I did my own research” on FB.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/pqcjie/majority_of_federal_conservative_candidates_wont/hdfsmt5/
1403,11,1632047047,"Every province in Canada said at the beginning of this that they would never introduce Vaccines mandates or passports. And now not only are they here everyone in Canada is welcoming it with open arms. We dont need vaccine passports guys...look at the rest of world in places that dont have them and they doing better than we are here.  VACCINES yes of course.  Vaccinated are safer from the non Vaccinated directly from my doctors mouth. Non vaxx are more risk around Vaccinated people from every doctor I talked to agreed with me to my face when I was sick with Covid.  So honestly non vaxxesd should be scared now definitely. 80% of population in Canada all vaccinated we will then move to herd immunity they said..  remember this?! Were well there in Canada now but we dont even hear words of herd immunity now and to be even spoken of. And what about antibodies testing for those of us who have had Covid and made through and recovered from it.  Not even a peep of a mention that's being studied here in this province and why not.? While other countries use that as a pass just like a vaccine if you've recovered from the Virus because your antibodies are so high. Just get your Vaxx and Passport and shut up is basically what's happening here in Canada. I'm not Anti anything but I do have eyes! Lol. And shit is weird here.  Here in B.C they said vaccine passports will never happen here or vaccine madates will never happen. So that was flat lie. We also cannot test widely here in B.C yet they say for antibodies because they have no proof yet. Even though that is the way since the beginning of time to see your immunity. Once infected from a Virus and recovered that is the best vaccine you can have and you T cells now have memory of the Virus as well. WE ALL KNOW THIS. It's high school biology this information not its not Top Secret. No one will go on record or on mainstream media about antibodies why is this? I'm just curious as to why not even drop of that on mainstream media here.They all dodged this question all big Doctors running this show in the western world . No one here finds this odd in Canada? When online alot of doctors are speaking on this from around the world! When other countries even the USA do an antibodies test with no questions asked and use that information to see what your immunity is after you've been infected. Here in B.C its almost taboo right now to even ask for an antibodies test, its beyond strange. I'm not an anti vaxxer by any means, I'm not anti anything health wise or science wise. . I have spent ALOT of money in travel vaccines for other countries in my years of traveling. So I'm not an anti vaxx person by any means and this not my issue. But it's just get the vax and shut your mouth here in Canada not so free as we thought now EH? Had Covid and survived it,so I believe it's my own human personal right to see my own antibody immunity test after infection. Should be just as easy getting your antibodies test after infection, as it is to be tested for Covid here in B.C.  Also I asked to be tested for the delta variant and was told here in BC they don't test for the Delta just a positive is a positive. So how do know then it's variants going around then?  Like what is actually going on here in BC. No answers nor do they give you much information on anything when your sick or recovered from the Virus.  Just my experience with the Virus we all have different views and experiences throughout this nightmare.  Bravo to Sweden! If that makes no sense to you then just research them as they are now living back in pre covid days there now. They never had covid passports or mask madates or vaccine mandates. Interesting wouldn't you say rest of the world? I guess they just have common sense and the  respect of telling their people truths during this pandemic and not treating them all as children. To be fair, I know it's a different mentality of humans over there as in comparison to here in the Western world.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/pr0l08/senior_ucp_member_calls_for_early_leadership/hdg424y/

1496,43,1631808309,"&gt;people like you  Thanks for this.    The argument is, that, in the before-times, outside of narrow fields, vaccines weren't mandatory as a condition of participating in every-day life.  And even within those narrow fields, the vaccines were decades old, using tried-and-true technology.  Even for school, they couldn't deny you public education for not being vaccinated.  Ontario has reasons of conscience, and PEI tried to make them mandatory as a condition of enrollment back in 2019 or early 2020, and failed.    Of course it's just a jab.  Swab your arm, take the jab.  But it's not a fallacy to say that, once we accept that mandatory procedures for 'public health' are acceptable, that opens the door to a lot of other things.  And this isn't a slippery slope fallacy, since I can cite, within living memory, evidence of it.  We used to forcibly sterilize the mentally disabled because it was in the interest of public health.  Same for institutionalizing the mentally ill against their wills.  If we accept that government coercion, in the interest of public health, is an acceptable form of exercise of power, do you think it stops at the covid vaccine? You ever have to show your proof of influenza booster to get into a bar? How about the covid booster?  When will 2 jabs not be enough to let you go about your business?  Or the twice-daily pills Pfizer is working on?  Is that all it takes?  A convincing argument that it's in public health interest?    You know law enforcement needs a warrant to track your cell phone location data, yeah?  Think that, under a public health emergency, they'll need such things to track your locations with the vaccine passport?  ""We suspect they have covid and want to check their whereabouts for contact tracing purposes.  Oh, look, they were at this place at the same time that thing happened.""  Or what about the big database all that info sits in, tied to your health number, which is tied to your SIN?  What do you think happens when administration of that db gets privatized, and your vaccine info gets 'cancelled' if you happen to have the wrong opinion on a thing?  Private company, it can do what it wants.    There's more at play than just, 'fuck you, you selfish prick, get the vaccine.'  If I were in power, and knew I could use the fear around a pandemic to take more control, control the movement of the population, and set up a *de facto* black-list banning folks with the wrong opinions from 'polite society', I'd do it in a heartbeat.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/ppdns9/covid19_live_updates_facing_suspension_without/hd3drk3/

If they then get infected, their odds being hospitalized are reduced and thus saving our healthcare system from further unnecessary strain. Omitting someone from healthcare because they made a stupid decision would set a rather bad precedent.  The amount of protection (o/a effectiveness) a vaccine provides will vary between people, and some people have more or less exposure to the virus than others.

1630,2,1631342476,"Well the main issue is that most opposing the COVID “vaccine” favor other vaccines and their reasons for refusing this “vaccine” is mainly because of key issues.   One main issue being that deaths from the vaccine, which as President Biden’s media spokesperson states, is occurring and is “being fixed”   The same administration that failed American citizens and Afghan citizens.   Another reason, is the lack of liability for manufacturers in regards to the side effects and dangers in the “vaccine”. If your vaccine continues causing health issues, including death, and if it’s failing to even prevent spread, then it’s only logical for others to refuse to get it if the virus it’s meant to protect from, is equally or less dangerous to their health.    Another reason they are against it is because of its survivable rate. For healthy individuals, long term health issues and death are highly unlikely. You have thousands of Americans and Canadians not receiving flu shots, getting the flu, and being completely fine. So obviously, the same people who already got COVID and only felt sick for a few weeks, will naturally not view it as a threat and refuse to get the vaccine.   In regards to Passports, that’s a bad idea. History clearly shows us how governments have used crisis and mandates in crisis to limit and stifle freedoms and people, a normal worry for millions worldwide rights now, especially considering governments trying to force vaccines and COVID mandates that may not be lawful.   In France and Italy for example, mass protests keep occurring because the people don’t support COVID passports.   You’re also saying you support a form of identification that can be used to prevent one from traveling, buying goods, so on so forth. Like the credit system in China, you supporting this blindly can ultimately lead to people suffering more. A passport system isn’t going to work and it’ll only serve to divide people into groups.   A more logical solution is to ease the worries of the population by solving the issues they have brought up. Holding manufacturers accountable for the side affects and showing evidence that the likelihood of side effects is rare or extreme low, after all, people get the flu shot because it doesn’t paralyze their face after one dose.    Preventing deaths from the vaccines and putting more effort into making a vaccine that’ll prevent transmission and symptoms.   So far all governments, especially Canada and the United States has done, is provide poor solutions and create more issues. Lockdowns and false words of relief that has hurt small businesses and hurt families. For example, NYC losing major resources in the form of business and the mass exodus of residents.   The division of its population and mass misinformation in regards to the positive and negatives of the virus vaccine and other solutions.    Restaurants and all kinds of employers can’t sustain their businesses with massive amounts of employees leaving due to restrictions, forced vaccine policies, and other mandates the employeess feel are unconstitutional.   In Ohio if I’m not mistaken, 26+ school bus drivers just quit in protest and others are on strike for that very reason.  In other States in the United States many doctors and nurses are actually quitting because they disagree that the vaccine and the mandates in place work.

1634,6,1631385214,"It's actually predictable because we've seen the same thing elsewhere. COVID hits the elderly hardest so once they're overwhelmingly vaccinated the proportion of vaccinated deaths and hospitalizations goes up.  Israel is the best example because they have a very high vaccination rate for the elderly and a low rate for the young so a majority of their hospitalizations have been vaccinated.

We should of course try and get as many people vaccinated as possible, but it also changes a lot of things. One of the justifications for something like workplace mandates outside of health care or a vaccine passport, is that it's a temporary infringement under exceptional circumstances and the goal is coercing your way to herd immunity.

The vaccines have been shown to lose efficacy over time; a mere six months could render a vaccinated person vulnerable to Covid 19 again.    A person vaccinated early on is not as protected as someone recently double vaxxed, yet this passport will give a false sense of security.  It creates a concept of a false wall where it is more like a slowly sinking island.    I know it is fear that drives both those who are for and those who are against the vaccine passport.  Both fears are legitimate and should be considered beyond the easily dismissed conspiracies.  Vaccines have proven effective, and should be encouraged to protect the vulnerable.  A vaccine passport does not do this.  It simply creates a divide for people who can/choose to be vaccinated and those who cannot/choose against being vaccinated.  I am finally concerned with the loss of our ability to control our personal information. Corporate tracking, data mining, and profiteering from our individual data is seemingly harmless to the individual but is having massive societal impacts. IE power players like Google and Facebook make much their money from the above methods and are increasingly influential in our political and economical climates by lobbying etc.  All forms of tracking by government and corporations should be considered invasive and detrimental to the individual regardless of it's subtle nature or positive immediate rewards.  This includes vaccine passports.  While simple and non invasive at this stage, it opens the door further for increased surveillance and individual losses (are you profiting from your data being used? You should be).  A comparison.  When the Europeans came to North America, they found groups of Indiginous people living on lands that were rich beyond what those inhabitants truly even understood.  While the European explorers and pioneers may also have had a dim view of the land, they were still able to bargain for the land (in some cases steal, but that's not the useful comparison here) with mere trinkets and items useful for the Indigenous people at the time.  Both thought they were getting a good deal (let's assume, as I'm sure there were many different opinions on it even then).  The Indigenous believed that the land was of value, but not usable to them, where the guns and metal certainly had immediate value.  We are the Indigenous peoples.  We are being exploited and our data is being taken from us in exchange for trinkets and apps (much like the one I'm using).  We are getting shortchanged in this deal.  We should recognize the massive value of our individual and collective data and demand the royalties deserved and have more say in it's use for profits.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/pkycti/vaccine_passport_or_immunization_record_why/hc7yeyc/
1680,23,1631217899,"So you brought up them tracking the time and place your passport was scanned, as well as who you are. If I am correct in assuming those are your main concerns, then lets examine that.  - Examining someone's drivers license at a bar does the same thing. It gives someone else the knowledge of where you were and when, as well as who you are. The obvious thing most people will respond with is, ""well its different if its a private business that can track you vs the government"". That is true. Except there is no talk about collecting any location information when you scan your passport. Its simply a method to show your vaccines are up to date. The QR code simply has to track your name and whether you're vaccinated or not, it doesn't have to have any other medical data. As many people have pointed out, you can print off the QR code and show that if you don't want it on your phone. Its only a receipt. So there's almost no difference with a QR code compared to a license, health card, or even a paper record saying ""this person is vaccinated"".  - Second, unless you pay cash for everything and don't have a cell phone, the data you're afraid of being tracked is already being tracked by private business' and banks. And as I already mentioned, a passport doesn't even need to connect to some government database, so its not as if you're at a greater risk of that info being sent to the government.  The one legitimate concern is that IF a passport must contain some of your PII medical data aside from ""this person has been vaccinated"" then there is potential for it to be hacked or stolen. This is only a concern if the vaccine passport is less like an actual passport/immunization record and more like a digital copy of your medical history, and no one has even suggested it should contain your medical history. It simply needs to contain the bare minimum, a record of immunization and thats it.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/pkycti/vaccine_passport_or_immunization_record_why/hc80n0c/

1682,25,1631218721,"Do you think paper immunization records were absurd and unnecessary? Because a vaccine passport simply needs to be a digital version of that old yellow paper record most people had.  It doesn't need to track your location, or other medical data. It doesn't even need to connect to a government database. All it needs to be is an simple way for a business to confirm an individual has been vaccinated. It is as simple as a unique code given to people after vaccination that says their name and that they are vaccinated, nothing else is required. So if it contained only that, would you still think it was absurd?  People keep saying its a slippery slope, but thats absurd, its not even a slope. Why? Because all that information you're afraid of being tracked by the government is already available to them if they wanted it. Your health card and drivers license are scannable or contain barcodes. Not only that, but if they wanted to track your movements, then the banks already have that data unless you pay cash for everything. So currently, your telecom company, your bank can track where you are or where you've been. Its already available through satellite imaging, and traffic cameras if they don't want to get it from your bank or phone company.   But it doesn't stop there, do you use a GPS when you drive? Because those connect into satellites which track you, thats the entire point of GPS systems. So you better pull out that old paper map whenever you're driving. You may not even want to drive unless its an older car because many have GPS built in or computer chips which store direction and speed in the engine.  Its not a slippery slope because we crossed that threshold years ago. Every piece of data which people have said they're afraid of being tracked is already available to numerous companies and has voluntarily been given away by individuals without even thinking about it.

You are right, nobody would have believed you if you told them that 3 years ago, because we weren't in a pandemic. It would not be a reasonable government encroachment if we weren't in the middle of a health system crisis. It is a reasonable encroachment right now though. So just as it wouldn't have been reasonable, and people would have fought against it, 3 years ago, any sort of ""tracking"" would be seen as unreasonable by the vast, vast, VAST majority of people.

If somebody has suggested it, they are idiots, and it will never get put into law. Not a chance. This is a non-argument. Again, to your point about 3 years ago. I would have STRONGLY argued against such a measure outside of a health crisis, and pretty much everybody else would have as well.   I 100% agree with a carbon tariff on imported goods. However, logistically, it will be very hard to implement due to the vagaries of international supply-chains. The reality is that we can only control what we can control, and we have no control over cheap merchandise created in India or China or wherever. If you just want to account for the transportation carbon footprint, rather than the the entire product lifecycle, that would likely be a little more doable. You could assign carbon costs based on a products dimensions (size, weight, etc) and the distance from its origin. I imagine this might still be hard to pull off, but if it is doable, I would be 100% be in favor of doing so.   All that being said, I am not an economist, and I haven't read any opinions on a carbon tariff the way I have around carbon taxes. I have read quite a bit about carbon taxes, so I feel relatively comfortable talking about them. Maybe there is an easy way of implementing a true carbon tariff that properly accounts for the full lifecycle of a product.

Their way of life is not threatened by a vaccine passport or a vaccine, it is threatened by a virus that they will get. Their fear is reasonable but misplaced because they misunderstand the reality of their situation.      Vaccine passports will be used world wide not because anyone in charge wants those who fear vaccination to suffer but because they are an effective tool in getting the vaccine hesitant to get vaccinated in a timely manner.  Vaccine passports, vaccine mandates and vaccine requirements are reasonable and ethical and moral impositions on an individual's autonomy primarily because an unchecked pandemic is a greater threat to individual freedom and autonomy than the vaccine itself. The vaccine hesitant and anti-vaxxers and anti-vaccine-passport people may not believe it, they certainly don't feel it, but the reality of the statistics is that the vaccine is safe and effective and the virus causes long term harm and kills. All feelings and misunderstandings aside, the statistics tell the reality of the situation: the virus is a bigger threat than the vaccine.      Those who understand the risks have already voluntarily been vaccinated as soon as they could and they do not need any more incentive to protect their autonomy and freedom. Vaccine passports, mandates and restrictions are not to protect the already vaccinated, they are to protect those who are not vaccinated.

The only limitations are for places where the removal of a mask indoors is anticipated (gyms, restaurants, theatres.)  The 'issue with needing a government mandated passport to do those basic tasks...' isn't exactly what the passports are going for.  It's for additional, *fun* tasks that, again, aren't a right to anyone.   (Also that doesn't take into account that many grocery stores offer pick-up options in their parking lots - such as some No Frills and Walmarts.)  The difference between the flu and the covid pandemic is that the flu has a far lower hospitalization and death rate (including the fact that the application of masks in general society reduced the number of flu cases in hospital to practically zero.)  And while 'most' hospitals are handling things better now than they were earlier on in the pandemic, that doesn't mean they always will - look at Alberta and the other Western Provinces. The majority of people there have been vaccinated, but they're bringing in nurses from different provinces because their hospitals are very quickly becoming overwhelmed - and the majority of those cases are from the unvaccinated.  As for that article, I understand some of their concerns. However, that group is a known conservative law system which supports anti-homosexual legislature and their founder had to take a leave of absence because of the intent to intimidate the Chief Justice of Manitoba.

Adjusted for age, unvaccinated cases are about 30 times higher to require hospitalization - it would be interesting to see these stats for obese people adjusted for vaccination status. However, it would probably be very difficult to define our measures for obesity, as obesity is much more complex. Obesity can have differing levels of severity and other variables that may or may not be linked to the person being obese. Our measuring methods for obesity is also not the best measure - a bodybuilder who eats well and exercises regularly with a bmi of 30 does not equate to an inactive person with the same bmi and much higher body fat percentage and eats fast food all day.   All in all I think a bmi passport would be much too difficult to implement due to the complexities of obesity and the lack of a quick and simple way that would work for everyone to fix it. For example, do we do mandated exercise and diets? Everyone’s bodies work so differently in terms of losing weight, on top of that a weight loss program for a very very obese person would look very different for a slightly obese person.  It is just way too much effort for both the government and the public to implement this.   I mean if there was a vaccine proven to decrease hospitalizations from covid by causing people to magically become not obese, I would probably be in favour of a passport for it.

1939,35,1630872384,"I can't believe this gym example anecdote is still brought up.  As you said yourself, the owner was a nut and they didn't apply any measures in there at all. If a business is letting people do whatever, then THAT is the problem, it's not an excuse to justify the passport.  This is just one story. Look at the numbers. There are tons of stats depending on the specific province and where you look exactly, but the obvious trend is that long-term care homes, hospitals, workplace, daycare and schools represent an overwhelming majority of the outbreaks. The places where the passport will be enforced (restaurants, bars, gyms) are a tiny portion.  You say that coupling your passport to your gym membership is a ''minor inconvenience'' as if the 2 minutes it takes is *what* people have against the passport. That's disingenuous. It's all the rest, and you might disagree with it, but it's not that people are too lazy to show a code once, you know that.  You say it will greatly protect the members. I doubt that. Run the numbers yourself. A virus that spreads pretty well amongst vaccinated + 87% eligible population vaccinated already + passport leaving out the unvaccinated in businesses that cause very few outbreaks + ignores the percentage of unvaccinated people who just stay home/can't go out + ignores the tons of loopholes/other activities they can gather in + ignores the fact that a vaccine proof means nothing as opposed to a negative test result still you can still have and spread the virus.  How many fewer hospitalization is that? Why is the government not even saying a word on it, they even phrase it themselves in terms of ''reward for our effort'' and whatnot, it is not presented like a public health guideline. If you don't disagree with the passport, you should at least disagree with their lack of honesty about what it really is.  If you've been convinced that a gym is now safe *because* of the vaccine passport, you haven't thought it through enough, and you're buying into that false sense of security. No one is tested at the door, they can all carry COVID and transmit it.   Let's see: 13% of the eligible population doesn't have a dose yet. So if you're in a gym with 50 people in it, on average 6 of them would be unvaccinated. The numbers vary wildly and data is still being gathered, but it looks like the current vaccines are on average 70% effective at reducing transmission of the Delta variant (sadly it seems to be waning with time, that number is probably lower, and it's clear we're in for booster shots soon) In other words, a gym full of only vaccinated people would average around that 70% reduced transmission, a gym with those 6 unvaccinated people (0% reduced) would mean the collective number for the gym would fall to 61.6% reduction. So 70% to 61.6% risk. That is not the kind of change that would make me go from feeling unsafe to feeling safe in a place. The fact that I'm young healthy and vaccinated is what is.   If you actually back the passport because you think it will be *effective* and impact the numbers, and not just that it's a measure to punish a group and reward another, tell me your predictions. How much do you think it will improve the impact on the healthcare system, which is supposedly the whole point of the measures in the first place, although the language recently used by the government says otherwise.  BTW this is coming from a healthcare worker that followed everything that made sense since the start. This is just a dumb measure with potential for abuse, and it's not ''either that or another lockdown''...

1970,19,1630777952,"&gt; I was saying that there are tons of people who hold views on things that you will disagree with, but them holding those views does not mean their views on all other subjects are wrong by default.  Then how is that relevant? I never said that people holding wrong beliefs on one thing are automatically wrong about all their other views. I said that many people here hold two specific and hypocritical beliefs.  &gt;See above. It's a mental health issue, not a physical one, with different effects upon the individual, those around them, and on society as a whole. This necessitates different strategies, and what is appropriate for one is not necessarily appropriate for the other.  Again, you keep ignoring my point. Giving drug addicts free drugs isn't a strategy to treat drug addiction from a medical standpoint. The selling point of it is that it results in a more desirable outcome than having them commit crimes to get drugs.  And guess what, if you support that but not paying people to get vaccinated, you're a hypocrite.  &gt;And I showed you how it was not as effective of a strategy. Merely by implementing a vaccine mandate for certain workers, and requiring proof of vaccination to attend the state fair next week, they have resulted in more than 2x the vaccination rate compared to when they were paying individuals.  How long do you suppose a vaccine mandate for certain workers will result in increased vaccination rates? Those people in those jobs will either get vaccinated or quit, and then the increased vaccination rates will end very quickly. A payout on the other hand is always relevant.  Vaccine mandates also can have unintended consequences, for example Houston is having nurse shortages after firing unvaccinated nurses: https://www.themainewire.com/2021/08/massive-nurse-shortage-hits-houston-weeks-after-150-unvaccinated-nurses-and-hospital-workers-fired/  &gt;If you don't deny vaccine mandates raise vaccination rates, and have the proof that the mandates and requirement of proof of vaccination raise rates more effectively than paying people does, than why are you arguing against the notion that a vaccine passport Alberta would achieve higher rates than paying people will?  Vaccine mandates raise vaccination rates. But also far more cost and far more negative effects than a payout. For example [Houston](https://www.themainewire.com/2021/08/massive-nurse-shortage-hits-houston-weeks-after-150-unvaccinated-nurses-and-hospital-workers-fired/) now has a massive nurse shortage after firing vaccinated nurses.  As for far less effective - one data point in New Mexico is not conclusive. You yourself stated that the vaccine increase from the mandate was double what the increase was from the payout. Yet the overall cost of vaccine passports will be far more than double what the payouts are.  &gt;Notice that I never said nobody would take advantage of it? What I did say was that it wasn't going to make much a dent,  That's what I meant. I just forgot to type the word ""significantly"" (as in ""significantly increase vaccinations"") every single time.   You literally have no evidence that vaccine payouts won't appreciably increase vaccinations, and there is plenty of evidence that they would.  E.g. the huge percentage increases cited in the first article I linked.    &gt;Last month, researchers randomly assigned unvaccinated respondents to see messages about financial incentives. Some people were asked about the chances they would get a vaccine if it came with a $25 cash payment; other people were asked about receiving $50 or $100.  &gt;Roughly a third of the unvaccinated population said a cash payment would make them more likely to get a shot. The benefits were largest for those in the group getting $100, which increased willingness (34 percent said they would get vaccinated) by six points over the $25 group.  https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/04/upshot/vaccine-incentive-experiment.html  &gt;Cash for shots? Studies suggest payouts improve vaccination rates  &gt;Directly giving Americans money to get a vaccine hasn’t been tested before, but studies in Africa and Latin America have shown cash payments prod individuals to make use of health services, including pediatrician visits, nutrition consultations, and educational sessions, according to Amanda Glassman, a public health expert at the Center for Global Development.

You may not see it as an argument, but thankfully the people who are making the decisions did.

However many of those people are also here opposing paying people to get vaccinated, on the grounds that it rewards people who didn't get vaccinated (until now).

That's a lot of money, but it comes with *literally all eligible Albertans* getting vaccinated.  So which is it?

2055,50,1630732111,"&gt;Yeah no, that's just disingenuous. You know perfectly well what you were doing.  Yes, I do know perfectly well what I was doing. I was saying that there are tons of people who hold views on things that you will disagree with, but them holding those views does not mean their views on all *other* subjects are wrong by default.  If you took it as me saying there were equal quantities of people who believe in the reptilian conspiracy, flat-earthers, young Earth believers, and the drug addiction strategy than that's on your own reading issue. I never wrote anything that would suggest or imply anything about the quantities of any of them, only that they exist.  Sorry bud, but I'm not going to buy into your gaslighting.  &gt;Drug addiction is in fact largely a physical health issue, but regardless that's irrelevant.  [It's not, actually.](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/substance-use-and-mental-health) Hence the reason why we [pair our addiction services with mental health services.](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/substance-use/get-help-problematic-substance-use.html)  &gt;So no, if you support one but not the other, you're a hypocrite. You keep dancing around that uncomfortable fact.  See above. It's a mental health issue, not a physical one, with different effects upon the individual, those around them, and on society as a whole. This necessitates different strategies, and what is appropriate for one is not necessarily appropriate for the other.  &gt;And that point is irrelevant. Did you forget what you needed to prove? Namely, that paying people to get vaccinated wouldn't actually result in noticeably more vaccinations.  And I showed you how it was not as effective of a strategy. Merely by implementing a vaccine mandate for certain workers, and requiring proof of vaccination to attend the state fair next week, they have resulted in more than 2x the vaccination rate compared to when they were paying individuals.  * The vaccination rate in New Mexico when they were paying people was just over 2000 a day. * New Mexico since ended those payments, and brought in a vaccine mandate for certain workers, and implemented a proof of vaccination required to attend the upcoming state fair. * The vaccination rate in New Mexico is now roughly 4200 a day.  Paying is poor strategy. It is less effective and won't solve the issue of people not getting the shot.  &gt;Well no, you didn't give any proof or any links. The only link (singular link, not links plural as you falsely stated) you gave was about how the vaccine mandate in New Mexico resulted in increased vaccinations. Which isn't something I ever argued against.  I said *give you*, not *gave you*. The ""links"" I spoke of refers to links in general, encompassing any previous and future ones. In other words, if you're not going to read proof or links I give you than you won't see the proof you're asking for. Make sense?  If you don't deny vaccine mandates raise vaccination rates, and have the proof that the mandates and requirement of proof of vaccination raise rates more effectively than paying people does, than why are you arguing against the notion that a vaccine passport Alberta would achieve higher rates than paying people will?  &gt;What you didn't do is provide any proof that vaccine payouts don't result in increased vaccinations.  Well it's a good thing that I never said it doesn't result in an increase at all then, isn't it?  Here's a collection of the statements I have said on that:  * $100 is not going to matter to the majority of unvaccinated. * $100 is not going to make a significant dent in the number of unvaccinated. * It's an expense that will do little to dent the unvaccinated numbers, and just amount to a fucking waste of cash when they could simply bring in the vaccine passport and have something far more effective. * Far less costly than implementing a vaccine passport, and far less effective. * My point is the vaccine being mandated in New Mexico had a greater effect on vaccination rates than paying people to get vaccinated.  Notice that I never said nobody would take advantage of it? What I *did* say was that it wasn't going to make much a dent, and that vaccine passports would be more effective.  The story of New Mexico backs up exactly what I was saying in those quotes. Paying the people did not make a significant dent to the vaccination numbers. 1/3 of the people vaccinated since mid-June happened in the past week alone, long after the payments ended.  The fact that you shared the article about New Mexico yet overlooked this speaks to the bias I referred to earlier.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/phb3i5/alberta_to_offer_100_incentive_to_get_vaccinated/hbjbe7e/

Also I might be more inclined to tolerate temporary coercion under extraordinary circumstances if it meant getting this behind us, but that's unlikely to be the case.

The risks we face right now are likely to be very similar to the risks we face a year, or two years from now regardless of whether we institute a vaccine passport now.

2092,36,1630605846,"&gt; I can leave my portable cell tracker at home to go to out and about.  I mean yes.  To be absolutely assured your movements are not tracked by anyone you can do this, but the argument being made by /u/5cot7 is hand waving away exactly WHO is tracking you.  If you own an android device, Google (and facebook if you have the app installed) will be tracking.  However, Apple phones are more private than Android phones.  On any cellphone device, so long as you have your radio turned on, the cellphone provider is also tracking you.  But the accuracy to which they track you is down to the cell (a geographic region served by a cellphone tower).  In neither of the above scenarios is the provincial, municipal, nor federal government tracking your movements.  *(That said, the government might have backdoors into the cell providers to extract cell location information, but again this level of tracking is limited to a geographic region.)*  People might be fine with corporations tracking their movements, but not OK with governments tracking their movements.  Without the vaccine passport, and assuming that the government has underhanded (and imho extra judicial) backdoors into the cell providers, you can be tracked to a general geographic region, but not your exact location.  EG The government might know (again this is assuming the cell providers are backdoored) that you've gone to the mall.  What they don't know is that you went to the mall to go work out at the gym, you then walked across the street to go to a fancy restaurant where an an anti-G7 protest group just happened to attend at the same time you did, then proceeded next door to a bar, where a bunch of suspected computer hackers happened to be going to at the same time you did.  In this scenario, all the government knows is that you happened to be sharing a relatively large geographic area with a bunch of individuals they find interesting.

You're 88% less likely to get it 2 weeks after your last shot. Within a few months, that's down to 40%. That's not ""generally safe"". You've still got a high chance of catching it.

So your privilege to do what you want in company of others is curtailed.

Does it affect you if other people do or do not wear their seatbelt? Of course not.  The vaccines are to ensure that if YOU do get sick, you don't become so sick as to require extensive medical support, potentially taking it away from others who need it.  As for the seatbelts, your not wearing your seatbelts can directly impact your passengers (this is not a pun) if you become the projectile inside the vehicle.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;What happened to medical privacy? We ask everyone about their vaccination status, but would you ask a woman if she's had an abortion? Would you ask strangers what medications they take? Or if they've contracted STDs?  The only thing that is revealed by the vaccine passport is whether you have been vaccinated.  It does not reveal any other aspect of your health.  Also, when I travelled internationally, I was asked to show my vaccination booklet, which had more information than does this vaccine passport.  The rules were - to gain access, you had to have proof of the required vaccinations.  No proof, no access to anything.  This is much less intrusive, limiting access to public venues with significant public presence (hence higher possibility of tranmission).  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;there's no reason to believe a vaccine passport ends here. If we decide that public or private sectors have the right to know our vaccination status for the safety of others, **why stop at covid? Why not ask for the vaccines for other diseases?**  Because we're dealing with an aerosolized virus that's extremely infectious.  Other diseases are generally insect or water-borne.  Those are controlled by other means.  No business wants to limit its customer base, but certain diseases (like the delta variant of Covid-19) has too great a potential impact on people.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;...it's time we go back to our common senses, and allow for the business owners, and the free market to decide how we operate....  Businesses operate as a creation of the government (that's what a federal or provincial charter allows - break the rules and the business can be dissolved).  As part of the privilege of owning a business and making money with it, every business owner is obliged to follow the rules (financial, tax, contract, safety, consumer, etc.).  Failure to do so can allow the government to dissolve the corporation.  Failure to follow the rules (of health) has forced the closure of restaurants, food producers, etc.  You seem to have little understanding of how business works.

2273,25,1630355169,"&gt;The virus is perfectly capable of spreading in vaccinated communities so it will do nothing to prevent spread  True, however it is not as virulent, and less injurious.   &gt;may infect make it worse,  So far, there's no evidence to suggest that is happening.   &gt;punish those wanting to wait a bit longer or wish to excercise bodily autonomy.   It's not a punishment.  People are being encouraged to make choices.  Get the vaccine, or don't. However, if you don't, there are consequences.  As for bodily autonomy, I don't get to choose what happens to me if I catch COVID from someone else. Where's my bodily autonomy?   &gt;Two: gives government more control and forces businesses to refuse customers especially when they need them most  We are at a point where all required services are available via a mouse-click. Shopping for food, pharmaceuticals, etc...some medical appointments can be done online. Schooling can be done online.  If businesses want to stay running, it's in their best financial interests to have people vaccinated.  If unvaccinated people infect a business, guess what? Dead customers don't make for good repeat customers.    &gt;Three: allows government tracking. Any secure system will need to verify your status with a government database which allows them to record where you went and at what time without warrants.  They do this anyway. Welcome to Candycrush2.0, or Tinder, or other dating applications.  Your entire online personality is stored on government databases.  Your financial records are on file. The Government has all your personal data anyway.   &gt;Four: do we really want to open the can of worms that governments can effectively force you to take medical treatment?   No one is forcing you to do anything.  We have national borders.  There are conditions of entry. Vaccines are, in some cases, a condition of entry. Don't like it, don't participate.  The choice is yours.   &gt;Fifth: vaccines work at preventing serious infection. You shouldn’t need a vaccine passport to protect vaccinated people.  Vaccines work best when a higher percentage of the population is vaccinated.  Measles outbreaks were practically unheard of in the 80s and 90s. Then, in the mid-2000s, as anti-vaxxers started popping up, so did measles outbreaks.  Even in vaccinated people. If we made this a, ""do it if you like"", the uptake would be minimal, and we'd be spending billions of dollars on healthcare until people realized that ""maybe we should try the vaccine"".   &gt;Sixth: it ignores natural immunity.  See measles argument. Yes, people can get measles and live. Most do.  But, brain damage is a potential consequence of measles.  So, your immune system eventually worked, but you end up brain-damaged as a result. Not the besy argument you've put forth there.    &gt;Sixth cont..:People who had covid are significantly less likely than people with Pfizer to catch and spread covid. Source?   &gt;Seven: do we really want to make it acceptable to require showing vaccine status every where you go? It's not a big deal. Really.  Hey, you vaccinated? Yes. Cool.  Let's hang out. No? Oh, okay. I'll play golf/tennis with you, but I'm not going to the bars and concerts with you.    &gt;7th cont...: The world changed after 9/11 and many of the security features put in place never uwent away. Why do you believe the government, once given this power, will want to remove it?  What's the overreach here? I mean, the powers the government obtained in the aftermath of 9/11 were exponentially greater than what they're asking for here.  Again, it's a binary question: are you vaccinated, yes or no. They're not using it to deny you a driver's license, or a bank account.    7th cont...: Covid is here to stay. Something I'll 100% agree with. The measures being implemented now are being put in place so that we can crush the virus this year/next, as opposed to a decade or so, of outbreaks and quarantines and disruptions.  Also, the cost of shutting down businesses, and travel, and trade, etc...not to mention the impact it's having on our healthcare system. Nurses are walking away from the profession.  If we aren't careful, we're gonna have a non-existent healthcare system, and that will be bad for everyone.

Its optimal in many ways but no one would ever try to enforce such a thing and we have court support that clearly determines that it is her choice and that if her employer were to terminate her for her health choice - they would be in trouble.  That being said - I am curious how much actual resistance is coming from the healthcare sector - I would trust them to possibly be more informed regarding COVID then your average redditor.

2372,16,1630098981,"&gt; So what exactly is the target we need to hit with vaccinations that instituting a vaccine passport would bump the numbers up to said target?  Mathematically, the number of people we need to vaccinate to reach herd immunity is inversely proportional to a virus's reproduction rate. Example, if R = 4, we need to vaccinate 3/4 (75%) so that 1 person only infects 1 instead of 4, which brings R down to 1 (the threshold where cases can no longer rise). If it's 5 we need to vaccinate 4/5, etc.   It's estimated that the R for ""original"" COVID was about 2, so 50% vaccination would have got us there. For ""alpha"" it was about 4, so 75% would have got it. For delta it's estimated to be about 7, so we need to vaccinate 6/7, or 86% (of the *entire* population).   These rates are estimated in a scenario with ""normal"" social interactions; things like social distancing can bring R rates down. So if we want cases under control, we can either continue with restrictions forever, or aim for an 85% overall vaccination rate, which probably means more like 95% of eligible adults.   The good news is that we probably don't need to get quite there; the vaccines are so protective against hospitalization that as long as the pool of unvaccinated people at risk for hospitalization is low enough, our system won't be overburdened. Right now though, that pool is still too large.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/pcvf5g/ontario_to_institute_vaccine_passport_system/halul7f/

Access to surgery and advanced medical care can make sense as well, since there is a need to limit the spread of disease in those environments.

Those people have a freedom of choice in who they interact with as well, excepting protected characteristics, but allowing for reasonable accommodation.

2506,3,1629829540,"The core problem isn't specifically being tracked, it's that some people actually still want to be treated as citizens, not serfs. The government is not our parents, and its core function is not to force people to live in an optimized manner.  If you want to implement paper or card based passports and say that businesses can refuse someone entry if they don't show it, sure, I'm on board. As long as you promise the government will never get to use them as a mandatory lock-down measure.  But it's pretty obvious to anyone that the passports are being set up with the intention of being made mandatory for store entry the moment a lock-down needs to occur. This is not the same thing as freedom of association and would be a massive over-step where the government determines who is allowed to go to work, who can shop where, and stratifies the population based on who complies with a medical procedure that apparently does not even work well enough to insulate the population against variants with an 85%+ compliance rate.  A physical vaccine ID card would not be a bad idea, but the direction we're trending basically requires that the card be digitally verifiable if you want it to ever be good for more than just this shot. A digital vaccine card is easily disabled if someone does not get a booster shot, or if someone has a warrant, or if someone simply says something someone in power happens not to like. We have a history of abuse from cops against natives even in Canada, hilarious misuse of the emergency alert system during the shootings, and I have zero faith that disabling a digital passport would not be straight up handed to the cops within twenty years.  Digital ID also only prevents tracking if the government designs the system in good faith. Showing my ID card at a bar does not flag to the government that I am in a bar, and purchasing alcohol does not inform the government that I am in a liquor store. A digital ID that is verified will pretty much instantly inform the government every time you try to buy liquor, any time you shop at a store that is not preferred, which could be pulled by prosecutors or police who are looking for any reason to mess with you. Yes, potentially we could catch some criminals for it, but when we have an insanely large repository of events and people all catalogued in a central database for the police they can basically pick whoever they want to fuck with and bust them for \*something\*. The power a digital passport would hand to the government is stronger than even any monitoring the Chinese government currently does.  I have a cell phone, and it is trackable, but it's trackable by an entity that must be subpoena'd to access the data. I can also just leave it at home. Your mandatory passports reporting to a central government repository are not the same. They are a hop and a skip away from a social credit orwellian nightmare the moment the government decides to act in bad faith.  We've got 85% vaccination rates, one of the best in the world, we're at the tail end of COVID. We got through the worst of it with masks and stay home orders. The government might be good dudes or may implement these items in a perfectly reasonable way, but we also just straight up don't need the passports. You're fear-mongering your way into handing the government all of the keys to unreasonable levels of population monitoring because we have \~15 deaths a day among \~35 million people, 65% of which are statistically above the average life expectancy to begin with.

The government, however, has access to a ton of data from you, but all of it is stale or requires a warrant. They know where I live, but they are not allowed in my house. They can pull my banking records, but with a warrant. They can pull me over, but only if they can find me.  Digital vaccine passports if not implemented in a very deliberate manner are an instant recipe to the government having warrantless data on where you are any time you are out buying things. They're a recipe for the cops to figure out you're at a bar, show up and harass you, especially with the changes to our drinking laws: [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/canadians-could-now-be-charged-with-drunk-driving-even-if-not-drunk-lawyers-warn-1.4975008](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/canadians-could-now-be-charged-with-drunk-driving-even-if-not-drunk-lawyers-warn-1.4975008)  Digital passports also give the theoretical ability for the government to ""disable"" your access to stores remotely if you do something they don't like.

On parole, but you picked up liquor for your wife? Enjoy a random visit from the cops.  As for why people have this ideology, it basically stems from the belief that the government was founded to make society function, but the minute details of your life ought to be controlled by you. There's a clear trend of the government gradually and continually taking on more power and responsibilities, given to them by themselves, to try to force society gradually into a utopia. A lot of things have gotten better, but the ability of the individual to disagree with their government continually gets weakened too. It's a concerning trend to anyone who values freedom above safety.   The seat belts seem comical in retrospect, but were an early example of the government stepping outside of their mandate to pass a law that preventing you from harming only yourself. It's definitely better to wear seatbelts, but at the heart of it, who asked them what their opinion on my practices is?

2518,15,1629853856,"I’m aware of this, in previous threads, I have mentioned it. You’re missing my point, I believe, let me clarify a little more.  Though, you do realize if 15% of people aren’t vaccinated, that leaves us with three groups. Medical reasons (that is perfectly valid), children (temporarily), and lastly, unvaccinated for their own personal reasons, but possibly not valid ones.  That means. The true numbers of people unvaccinated for the 3rd reason, is actually most likely tiny (especially in B.C, with a population of 85% with their first dose) statistically. Because, not many people have a large percentage of health issues to where they would fall in that category. People with valid medical reasons aren’t going out. Secondly the children are *ONLY* temporarily. So once again, the true number of unvaccinated, as you recall them: “who refused” would be mere.   My point is, the government contradicted themselves. They stripped the rights of the unvaccinated. Where Covid highest spreads, is usually in close proximity, and that means events like parties, and so forth. Once the ridiculous Covid passport comes into play, that means it’s Vaccinated amongst Vaccinated.  So my point is, why would you mask the vaccinated, when they throughly push the blame on the unvaccinated, for “stopping society from going back to normal” if the vaccines are the true answer, and push they’ve been saying.  My TL;DR to you once again is. The goverment doesn’t know what they’re doing. They don’t know “how to flatten the curve” as they falsely promised for over a year now. Mandating masks, contradicts everything they’ve been pushing media wise, and now they won’t have a scapegoat.  You’re missing the point.   And yes - I’m aware of vaccinated people can the virus, but if vaccinated people are amongst the vaccinated, and the unvaccinated are to be blamed. They won’t be anymore, so it’ll be vaccinated spreading it to vaccinated at this point, which once again contradicts their push for vaccines and action. If the vaccine is all that true, and our problem solver (black and white) the mandates for masks wouldn’t be needed. Vaccinated won’t be around to be giving it to the vaccinated who want to go party.   This is what I’m arguing.

A Chicago physician wrote in 1901 that “Vaccination should be the seal on the passport of entrance to the public schools, to the voters’ booth, to the box of the juryman, and to every position of duty, privilege, profit or honor in the gift of either the State or the Nation.”  &gt; Employers across the country acted to make smallpox immunity a condition of employment. Factories, mines, railroads and other industrial workplaces with tight quarters were particularly forceful in demanding proof of vaccination. In 1903, Maine’s government decreed that “no person be allowed to enter the employ of, or work in, a lumber camp who can not show a good vaccination scar. Though workers sometimes resisted, corporations and governments usually ensured that they took the vaccine in the end.  &gt; Social gatherings and clubs, too, sometimes required proof of vaccination in order to attend. When smallpox swept through Kansas City in 1921, one newspaper reported that “‘Show a scar’ has been officially adopted as the passwords to lodges and other meetings.” Public school leaders across the country also required students to present a “plain scar, the records of a school or a certificate by a reputable physician” in order to enter their institutions. Among others, the superintendent of the Savannah, Ga., school system in 1897 arranged for students to be provided with “admission cards” to their school once they provided proof of vaccination.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/pa7s0k/bc_becomes_second_province_to_require_proof_of/ha2spfl/

The testing process for the COVID vaccines were fast-tracked to within one year.  The US project to develop and distribute the COVID vaccines was officially called 'Operation Warp Speed'.

2572,0,1629655166,"&gt;Imagine the danger it poses to tell people you are safe to go to an arena event wit 15000 people because everyone is vaccinated, knowing full well that there will certainly be people in that crowd who are positive and that their rate of transmission is the same as that of an unvaccinated individual.  The difference comes in with how likely someone is to catch it, and how long someone is contagious for.  Let's say out of that 15,000 people attending, half are vaccinated and half are unvaccinated. Let's also say 10% were infected at some point in the week ahead of the event - again half of them vaccinated, and unvaccinated.  That means 750 infected vaccinated, and 750 infected unvaccinated within the 7 days before the event.  For simplicity sake let's say that the infected individuals create a 25% chance of spreading it to the people around them - and continuing with the 50/50 theme half of those are vaccinated, and half are unvaccinated. That's 4.5 vaccinated, and 4.5 unvaccinated (decimals will work out in the end).  At a 25% chance of spreading it, the unvaccinated individuals would stand to spread the virus to 1.125 unvaccinated individual around them. This would be a total of 844 new infections.  However [because having the vaccine halves your chance of catching it](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/08/04/fully-vaccinated-half-as-likely-to-catch-delta-covid-variant-and-less-likely-to-infect-others-study-finds/), there is only a 12.5% chance for them to spread it to the *vaccinated* individuals around them. This results in 422 new infections.  **Those are for the 750 unvaccinated individuals infected within 7 days of the event. They would lead to a total of 1,266 new cases.**  For the 750 vaccinated individuals, [we know that their period of being as contagious is less than half that of the unvaccinated](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/08/11/covid-transmission-among-vaccinated-unvaccinated-what-experts-say/5488398001/). This means out of the 750 who were infected in the 7 days ahead of the event, half no longer carry those high viral loads.  So of the 750, now only 375 would have that high spread risk.  Using that same 25% chance of spreading it, these vaccinated individuals would spread the virus to 1.125 unvaccinated individuals around them. This would be a total of 422 new infections.  And again because the vaccine halves your chance of catching it, that 12.5% chance in *unvaccinated* individuals results in 211 new infections.  **Those are for the 750 vaccinated individuals infected within 7 days of the event. They would lead to a total of 633 new cases.**  Even with 50% of the people around the unvaccinated being vaccinated, the unvaccinated individuals spread it at a rate of 168.8%.  And even with 50% of the people around the vaccinated being unvaccinated, the vaccinated individuals spread it at a rate of 84.4%.  This highlights the clear risk that the unvaccinated represent in spread the virus.  **For a final example, let's look at the rate we'd see with a vaccine passport.**  All 1,500 infections would have occurred in vaccinated individuals, and all the 9 people around them would be vaccinated.  Since the viral load is high for half the time in the vaccinated, only half of them run the risk of that 25% spread. And since the vaccinated have half the chance of catching the virus, that's only a 12.5% chance to spread.  The result is 750 contagious individuals who go on to spread it to 422 people. That is a spread rate of 56.3%.  This is why getting the vaccine matters, and why vaccine passports in high transmission areas would slow the spread. You could still catch it, but because of the vaccine protection the numbers trend *downward,* rather than *upwards* when unvaccinated are involved.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/p8wve6/most_canadians_in_favour_of_vaccine_passports_for/h9xo8pm/

I have literally 0 issues with the COVID vaccine being added to the list of required vaccine for your kids to go to school or travel to certain countries.  The vaccine passport being used within the borders will have very little impact on the spread of the disease. It will not ""end this whold covid bullshit*.   With such a high percentage of the population vaccinated already, there is not that much left we can realistically convince, and simple deterents like this don't work fantastically. There won't be a world of difference between say, an 80% and an 85% vaccinated population. Even a 100% vaccinated population within the country wouldn't end COVID, we'd need to vaccinate the whole world.  We also have a virus that now spreads pretty well through vaccinated people anyway (although gladly they don't get as sick), we will eventually need booster shots/a different vaccine.  The passport has a very limited amount of outbreaks it could prevent since outbreaks rarely happen in the sectors it will be implented in (restaurants/bars/theatres/etc.) This is not to say the passport will have zero effect, but it is small enough to not be worth the downsides in my view.  It is a costly, intrusive, and innefficient measure. Saying this does not make me anti-vax or a conspiracy nut or whatever else. It's just my observation. While asking for vaccination records for school and travel wouldn't be anything new, mandating *private* businesses to demand a piece of someone's healthcare records to simply enter their business would be. Even more unusual if you consider that this proof of vaccination is neither a proof you don't currently carry COVID or that you won't transmit it to someone there.   I would have significantly fewer issues with the government, for instance, offering private businesses to opt in or out of the passport thing. Or better yet, offer to pay for rapid COVID tests for businesses so they can ACTUALLY evaluate if someone entering their store is an outbreak waiting to happen or not.  I will not go whatsoever into the idea that this is a tracking system and a government conspiracy or what have you, but it does *needlessly* add a layer of identification and segregation that CAN be exploited by governments. If not this one, maybe a future one. It is very likely such a system would last a really long time, or even be applied to other diseases or other things.

If you are only around vaccinated individuals you still can catch it if someone is carrying it, but your chances of exposure are lower compared to if you are around a mix of vaccinated and unvaccinated.  The unvaccinated individuals are more likely to catch it, and they have a longer infectious duration, so their presence in these areas of high transmission creates an infection risk for even people who are vaccinated, as well as represents an elevated risk to themselves due to the high transmission.

2627,5,1629441774,"Another elephant in the room is the blind assumption that a vaccine passport will act like some magical barrier against others' risky social behaviours. But it won't, especially given the transmissibility of the new variants.  E.g. a fully-vaccinated person who goes to crowded clubs/concerts/stadiums every weekend and only wears a mask when legally required will always have a higher risk of contracting and spreading COVID than an unvaccinated person/couple who spends the weekends at home watching TV, wears masks in stores, and never goes into dense crowds.  The same goes for fully-vaccinated people who spend dozens of hours per week in physical contact with unvaccinated, school/daycare-attending children. It would be inhumane not to play with one's kids, but to blindly assume like many have for the last 18 months that children aren't an obvious disease vector is ridiculous. They catch and spread it just like anyone else, particularly with delta.  So, even if vaccinated, these are two very high-risk groups that will never be as safe to interact with as people who, vaccinated or not, socially distance and wear masks outside their home. While vaccines greatly reduce the odds of catching and transmitting COVID, so many vaccinated people's behaviours can instantly reverse those odds (and how), to everyone's peril. Vaccine passports won't do a single thing about that except lull everyone into a false sense of confidence.   Now, some things could help to fill this gap, like behavioural questionnaires for entry to workplaces, or mandatory COVID tracking apps at all public venues. But vaccinated people would flip their shit if they were actually held as accountable for their risky post-vaccination behaviour as they want unvaccinated people to be.

In the US, they've been making it sound like hospitals were having a lot more children due to the Delta variant, using that to drive up vaccination rates, while it's actually RSV cases that are increasing these rates as covid was and still is not dangerous to children. According to the CDC, RSV puts on a normal year over 50,000 kids aged 5 and less in hospitals, those are normally considered acceptable numbers but this year, we know how much panic that will cause, especially as the rebound drive higher numbers. By the way, Australia has already experienced that significant RSV rebound last year which is why it was obvious that it'd be happening here as well, and the same thing is happening, cases are increasing way earlier than normally expected, as if losing herd immunity shifted the usual seasonal wave a couple months early.  I'm pretty sure more lockdowns will be coming. And the good news is that Moderna has been having good results with its mRNA RSV vaccine... so people will be calling for lockdowns until we can vaccinate everyone with it and we can add it to the vaccine passport, along with the flu vaccine (more efficient mRNA ones are coming too).  !RemindMe 5 months",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/p7666j/is_trudeau_calling_this_election_because_shit_is/h9jhmwq/

The truth is being vaccinated makes you already protected from the virus, and vaccine passports are more of a way of protecting unvaccinated people.    That said, vaccine records are a healthcare record, and businesses should not have access to it. A lot of businesses don’t take health cards as ID (note: some still do) just to avoid this bit of complication.     Now the argument is COVID is a different beast and should get a different treatment. While I don’t disagree, I’m more concerned about the government’s implementation. If they can barely get CERB right, how am I supposed to expect a proper implementation of a vaccine passport? There are so many potential issues with a vaccine passport, eg tracking our activity, leak of personal information (because a software built in a hurry is at a much higher risk of security breach), but also opens the door to further use of government enforced identification. Do we start asking for proof of travel so we can guarantee you might not have Ebola (lysogenic so not yet symptomatic)? Do we ask for proof of no consumption of chicken in HK in case of HxNx virus? It’s a slippery slope.    What it needs to be is a temporary measure. The measure needs to have an end date defined from the start, with no ability for extension. In addition, careful consideration needs to be done to maximize protection of privacy and minimize access to medical records. Business (such as a restaurant) access requests needs to be anonymized to remove the possibility of tracking individuals, and legal safeguards in place so businesses don’t abuse the system to get information out of it for discriminatory purposes.

It's not just Quebec, every government in the world is trying to reduce covid restrictions safely as they balance out the risks the delta variant poses with the growing amount of their population becoming vaccinated. Locking certain things behind a vaccine passport is just another component of their strategy. Keep things open for the people who won't clog up hospitals if they catch covid.

2833,92,1629036030,"I am neither for nor against such a thing because I have no idea how it's going to be implemented.  I haven't formed an opinion yet.  I grew up in Canada, arriving as an immigrant 51 years ago.  I watched dystopian films and even TV shows like Hogan's Heroes (""Papers Please"") and it was ingrained into my psyche that Canada is such a great place because I have freedom of movement and the government isn't tracking everywhere I've been.  That I can't be implicated in a crime just because I was in the same 3 places as a gun-man or what have you.  I admit to feeling somewhat disturbed when Google started emailing me a map of all the places I've been in the last month.   I remember feeling disturbed when I started seeing cameras pop up in grocery stores, convenience stores, coffee shops, etc.  My son grew up in this world and views it as completely normal and un-pervasive that his boss has a camera pointed at his desk so he can be watched.   As a grumpy old man, if my boss put a camera over my desk, the last frame he'd have is that of my middle finger pointing at the lens as I pack up my things and walk out.  So now the suggestion is that we're going to end up with some sort of QR code or something that is tied to our vaccination status that will lead the QR reader to some sort of government website so now our movement through the country can be tracked and stored forever.  To me this is just normalizing a future that, 30 years ago, I would have viewed as a dystopian future that I don't want to live in.  Maybe that's what the issue with a vaccine passport is.

The unvaccinated are continuing the spread of COVID, thereby jeopardizing those that can’t get vaccinated, like children under 12, or people that are immuno-compromised.  The unvaccinated are providing a means for the virus to incubate and mutate, possibly into variants that are vaccine resistant. In 6 months we could be where we were a year ago, searching for a new vaccine to counter a new variant of the virus.  A vaccine passport protects people who have been vaccinated, and allows them to get on with their lives, back to some semblance of normal.  It also provides a strong incentive for people to get vaccinated as we push toward herd immunity. For those willing to stand by their convictions and not get vaccinated, good for you.

This plan is based on advice from our public health officials with priority placed on the safety and security of all Canadians.   &gt;   &gt;For Canadians who decide to travel, using a proof of vaccination will provide foreign border officials with the vaccination history needed to assess whether a traveller meets their public health requirements and provide a trusted and verifiable credential for when they return home.   &gt;   &gt;Travellers will be able to submit their proof of vaccination in ArriveCAN (mobile app or Canada.ca/ArriveCAN) when coming back to Canada.

2973,61,1628720157,"&gt;What I want to know is why people like you want to hide their vaccination status.  I literally stated in my initial response in this thread that I am fully vaccinated.  I'm actually willing to bet that I've got more vaccines than the average Canadian because of the work I've done overseas.  In fact it's been a habit of mine for years to put my vaccine booklet in my luggage while traveling even domestically, just because it's a good idea.  So what am I trying to hide, exactly?  I've never had to actually produce my vaccine booklet for anything other than travel to some parts of Africa where Yellow Fever is still an issue, though.  &gt;I understand people want to keep other medical issues private, but why vaccination status?  Why does it matter?  Take this for an example: a Jehova's Witness decides, on religious grounds, that they will not get the vaccine.  What should happen?  Should they be barred from public life until they violate their deeply held religious beliefs?  Another example: a person is immunocompromised and is directed by their doctor to not take the vaccine.  What should happen?  Should they be barred from public life until they put their health at risk by violating their doctor's orders?  I'm not asking these questions idly - I'd actually like for you to answer them.  &gt;Is it the slippery slope argument, where you think this will lead to even more ""authoritarian"" measures in the future?  That's another potential that we must be wary of, absolutely.  What justification can you give for not requiring proof of the annual flu vaccine?  After all, the flu kills lots of people each year as well and there is a vaccine available.  What reasoning can you provide to not require flu vaccine passports which could not also be used against covid vaccine passports?   Let's go a step further when it comes to diseases.  How about STD passports?  Why would you be opposed to revealing if you have an STD to the laundromat worker?  *If you've got nothing to hide then you've got nothing to fear*, right?  But let's go a step further and broaden this to our health and healthcare system.  How about a nonsmoking passport?  After all, smokers cost the taxpayers a staggering amount for their healthcare directly related to smoking, don't they?  How about an obesity passport?  They're even worse than the smokers in terms of cost to the healthcare system, correct?  Shouldn't there be penalties for being such a drain on society?  And what of those who refuse to mend their ways?  What solution do you propose to deal with them?  Yes, the concern for how the rules we enact now will be applied in the future, and to future generations, is absolutely a concern that any reasonable person should hold.  I strongly believe that everyone who *can* get vaccinated should - and that goes not only for covid, but for all diseases we have vaccines for.  But the government is *massively* overreaching when they try to demand papers from every person to participate in society, and they should be opposed.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/p2c1wb/quebec_to_bar_unvaccinated_people_from/h8l87bn/

Let me explain my reasoning why I'm against domestic passports.  &gt;  Do you show your driver's license when the cops ask you?   Yes, because they are public officers so they know who is driving. Driving is a public privilege. This is different from visiting a **private** location.    &gt;DO you drive around with a license plate on your car that everyone can see?   Yes, because it's my cars identification for the government. Again, public. Different from private.   &gt; Do you submit your passport when traveling abroad?   I support international vaccine passports.   &gt; Do you submit to the metal detector or other forms of search at the airport?   Yes, because this protects the country (and target countries) when people enter/exit.   &gt; Have you ever shown your ID card a bouncer at a nightclub?   I mean, no, but again, this is a law for drinking and age appropriate entertainment at specific establishments.  &gt; Do you scan your ""point card"" (fidelity card) at Canadian Tire, grocery or the pharmacy?       Points are an optional choice at a private enterprise.  &gt;Do you show your Costco membership card (at Costco)?  Costco is a club. Not really relevant. You pay for membership because that's their business model.   &gt;Then why not show a QR code when you visit a bar or a restaurant as a temporary measure, even if it is just to help put other people at ease and promote vaccination?  A few reasons.   1. I don't want to give my information for every bar, restaurant, gym, festival, etc. 2. Who is saying it's temporary? And how so temporary? 6 months? A year? 2? 3?  3. It's 'encouraging' others to get through coercion.  There is also the reasons of enforcement. How many places do you think will actually do this? How many resources will it consume, both from businesses and from calls to the police?   &gt;If you are afraid about your privacy, just know that every bar and licensed restaurant is entitled to ask you for ID, otherwise they also can refuse to serve you. And be aware that your driver's license or passport contain and lot more information than that QR code.  Licensed restaurant can only ask if you're getting served alcohol and that's just to see your bday, not your medical history. Also, my actual passport will only really be used at a border to enter/exit countries so no issues here. Also, I'd like to see what exact information is being sent to the servers and who has access to it.   &gt;The sooner everyone is vaccinated, the sooner we get our lives back to normal.  100% agreed.   &gt;If you disagree with the vaccine passport, then, to be consistent, you should also disagree with license plates...  These are very, very different things.  Now, I'll bring these points to you. Consider the following:   * I'm old enough to remember all of the measures brought through after 9/11. Those became permanent. What I'm concerned about is these 'temporary' measures lasting over a year, two years, 5 years... Who knows. Depends how much the goal posts get moved.  * What happens when/if this gets expanded to more, or all businesses? What about barring people from public access (example, can't use the GO if you're not vaccinated). What will enforcement look like? Are you OK with this ballooning in size?  * What about marginalized communities? By the data, POC get vaccines the least. Do we risk them for the passports?  I think vaccine passports for domestic usage is opening a massive can of worms that will be hard to put a lid on once it's out. You can say all you want it's temporary and encourages others to get vaxxed, but I'm old enough to know temporary measures are often much longer or permenant, and the encouragement is coercion.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/p1uepw/quebec_to_implement_covid19_vaccine_passport_on/h8gae56/

3030,24,1628642489,"&gt; Then  why not show a QR code when you visit a bar or a restaurant as a temporary measure, even if it is just to help put other people at ease  Because doing so “to put other people at ease” is literally just virtue signaling and empathy theater.  If a person is symptomatic and he is hacking and coughing, I can understand how that may make others around him uncomfortable to be in his vicinity.  But if you feel uncomfortable being surround a perfectly healthy person showing zero indication of illness, then maybe it’s you who are overly anxious that’s the problem and not the person who is perfectly healthy showing zero indication of illness.    &gt; even if it is just to help put other people at ease and promote vaccination?  The goal shouldn’t be to promote vaccination.  The goal should be to promote societal cohesion and prevent societal collapse.  Vaccine passports deepen the societal chasm by way of segregation, two tier treatment, and “punishing” people who don’t fall lockstep with you mentally and culturally.  Vaccine passports are extremely divisive, as it literally cleaves society into two classes of people.  If the goal was increasing public health, all the vulnerable people ought to stay home.  They are mostly the ones getting infected, getting super sick, superspreading it in high viral loads to those around them via their underperforming immune systems, being hospitalized with long-term covid infections posing an elevated risk to hospital staff tasked with their care, and then dying from said covid infections. If we lock down the vulnerable only (aka targeted protection), or if we mandate 100% vaccination rate on the elderly only, we would be able to improve public health and safety dramatically.  Throwing all the non-vulnerable into the same bucket has marginal benefits at best, and comes with a far greater cost.  So why don’t we either mandate 100% vaccination of everyone over the age of 60, or mandate everyone over 60 to shelter in place until the pandemic is over?  Or at least ban anyone over age 60 from going to restaurants, salons, bars, and nightclubs?  Or, instead of demanding everyone vaccinate in order to access things like groceries stores, why don’t we demand groceries stores open up 2 hours a day (like maybe 8-10am) where they mandate masking, social distancing, never-ending sanitizing of surfaces etc, but after 10am, the store reverts to pre-covid level of free-for-all, where no on is being told to mask or socially distance.  The vulnerable and the terrorized have their chance to shop during the 8-10am sanitized hours and the rest of us can shop anytime after 10am.  Everyone has a choice in the matter, and no one is forced to cater to anyone else’s lowest common vulnerability.    &gt; The sooner everyone is vaccinated, the sooner we get our lives back to normal.  Nah.  The sooner you act normal, the sooner we go back to normal.    &gt;**If you disagree with the vaccine passport, then, to be consistent, you should also disagree with license plates...**  License plates don’t compare to an injection of a substance in your body.

That is 20 years before I got it.  My point is that from my perspective measles was no big deal.  Because I lived.  For the other 1 in 1000 it was a big deal because they died.  And because they died they are therefor not here to voice their opinion.  Wait for someone to inform me that measles was not present at my time and my mother was wrong or I misremember what she said.

Their farm would not have been sold and him and his siblings would not have been adopted out.  I also would not likely be here to write this but not the point.  Anyway.

3060,54,1628685327,"Full text below:  ***  Unvaccinated people in Quebec will be denied access to non-essential public spaces such as bars, restaurants and gyms as of Sept. 1, the province’s Health Minister announced on Tuesday as he revealed details of the most sweeping vaccine passport policy in the country. Health Minister Christian Dubé said at a news conference on Tuesday that Quebeckers would need to scan a code on a smartphone application to get into busy public spaces, including festivals and concert venues. Employees at those businesses will not face the same vaccination requirement to avoid running afoul of labour laws, Mr. Dubé said. People from other provinces and countries will also have to use the system. The announcement continues Quebec’s record of aggressive and controversial responses to the [COVID-19](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/topics/coronavirus/) pandemic, which ravaged the province’s long-term care sector during the first wave. With its long winter curfew and early decision to delay second doses of the vaccine, Quebec has regularly staked out distinct policy terrain from the rest of the country, sometimes inspired by ideas in Europe.   The province will begin to test the passport at a Quebec City sports bar this week, the first of at least two pilot projects intended to smooth out technical issues before the formal launch in September. The system will cover all of Quebec, not just hard-hit regions as the government previously said, in response to rising case counts and the growing prevalence of the more-contagious Delta variant of the novel coronavirus. The Health Minister presented the expansive new policy as a way to prevent another round of lockdowns in a fall resurgence of the virus.   “A fourth wave is inevitable in Quebec,” he said. “The idea is to give access to these locations only to people who are fully vaccinated, instead of closing them like we have during the first three waves.” The provinces are divided over whether to require proof of vaccination for certain activities.   Internationally, vaccine passports are gaining currency. Israel, France and New York, among other places, have announced or implemented restrictions on access to at least some businesses based on vaccination status.   The government of Canada is working on a proof-of-vaccination system for international travel.   Quebec will become the third province in Canada to use a vaccine passport of some kind, after Manitoba and PEI, although Quebec’s will be the most comprehensive. Visitors to PEI can apply for a proof-of-vaccination pass to allow them to enter the province without self-isolating, while residents of Manitoba with proof of two shots can attend some large gatherings such as pro sporting events.   Other provinces, such as Alberta, say they have no plans to implement a vaccine passport program. Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott said on Tuesday that her government will not mandate vaccinations, and individual businesses can decide whether to require them for staff or patrons. “That has always been our position – that we are not mandating vaccines, that that is something for people to choose for themselves, but we encourage people to get vaccinated,” she told reporters at a hospital announcement in Collingwood, Ont. Ms. Elliott also raised concerns that proof-of-vaccination smart cards could be subject to fraud, and said Ontario’s paper and e-mail confirmations of second doses will suffice.  Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, Kieran Moore, said at his weekly briefing that Ontario-specific vaccination passports are a government decision, but he does not think they are “absolutely necessary” now. Still, he said policies will be reviewed over time. “I don’t think any door has been formally closed, but we are achieving the goals we wanted to achieve,” he said, adding that he expects vaccination numbers to climb again in September. So far, 81 per cent of Ontarians aged 12 and up have received one dose, and 72 per cent are fully vaccinated. Dr. Moore said the province’s goal is 85 per cent to 90 per cent fully vaccinated.  Despite their different approaches, Quebec will work with Ontario to make sure qualifying residents of that province are able to use Quebec’s vaccine passport, said Mr. Dubé, noting the close links between the provinces.  Quebec also boasts high rates of vaccination, with 84.8 per cent of residents above the age of 12 having received one dose, and 72.2 per cent fully vaccinated, according to its public-health institute. The province continues to nudge reluctant Quebeckers to get their shots in creative ways – a provincial lottery open to fully vaccinated people held its first draw last week – and Mr. Dubé said he hopes the passport system will encourage uptake. “Don’t wait to hit a wall in September – go get vaccinated,” he said at his news conference, which was briefly interrupted by a protester opposed to public-health measures. Geneviève Beaulieu-Pelletier, a psychologist and associate professor at the Université du Québec à Montréal, said the passport system could help overcome some vaccine hesitancy by giving hardened opponents an excuse to get their shots while saving face. “There are people who don’t dare give up their position,” she said. Now, they can say they didn’t have a choice. With a report from The Canadian Press",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/p2c1wb/quebec_to_bar_unvaccinated_people_from/h8izm52/

Since you've never have given me a clear answer as to how any vaccine passport legislation will somehow bypass it's MANY legal hurdles; most notable of which is a challenge under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms I'm going to assume you're not aware of it.  Here's a link to an overview so you can learn some more if you're interested.  https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/rfc-dlc/ccrf-ccdl/check/art1.html  Showing that there are no less rights-impairing means (such as requiring PPE in place of vaccine proof as you suggested) of achieving the objective is a key factor in determining if a law complies with the charter.  In our example; I would argue that even with PPE, you probably shouldn't be working with the elderly and vulnerable if you're not vaccinated. I think you could easily demonstrate that it's not practical to expect non-medical personnel to use PPE correctly all the time and thus the risk is too high.

However, while at glance these macro statements hold room for questions and healthy debate.  a.  I have not seen any stats that back-up the statement that unvaxxed people are contributing to the transmission of cases.  The statement has only been ""Unvaxxed people make up majority of hospital ICU Covid patients"", which has been a testament to the fact that this COVID shot save lives.  Cases should mean nothing if the number of deaths/case is down.  The nation is over 70% vaccinated, at what threshold would you feel safe mingling around unvaxxed people?  Vaccinated become cases as well. great.  Ok, well not a big deal as long as they do not become hospitalized we are still good.  Right?  b.  My poor grammar made you assume I am likely an anti-masker.  This is incorrect.  What I meant to say is, now that we seem to be through the thick of it (ie, mask mandates lifting in my current province) we as a population still need to practice common sense and practice prevention practices (masks, stay home if sick, wash hands, etc).  Masks were made mandatory, social distancing was implemented, PPE where social distancing is not possible.  So, I do understand why and what we have been doing since day 1.  However, now at day 700 we don't need to be so vigilant - no more masks indoors etc.  Did that clear things up?   c.  *or use our healthcare service at all.*  Sad statement to read TorontoSoup.  But at least it was pretty humorous to me (I enjoy dark humour).  Seeing the burden that the healthcare system has been under for the past 30 years of my life due to complications through obesity.  COVID doesn't hold a candle to what obesity has costed the medical system, and our tax dollars).  Especially since ""*pretty much all""* major complications from COVID are found in those who are obese who are not already unwell or quite old (80+).  Would you be ok to save lives nationwide by banning big soda, high tariff on junk food, shut down fast food and mandating exercise to get our population healthy again?

This isnt just a health debate, this is also collides with personal rights and freedoms that we all have as Canadians.  There are elements of this passport that disrupt those values that we all take for granted.  We are acting like this virus that yes, although deadly to a large number is still pretty shitty at killing (it is very good at spreading though) will end the world as we know it.  If this is what is happening to our freedoms with this, what happens when something deadlier comes along?  &amp;#x200B;  We are in a constant state of fear - take the vaccine you won't die.  You also won't die from the individual who gave you COVID at the pool who's not vaccinated.  I understand my odds pertaining to statistics from this virus.

3173,1,1628358063,"Perhaps I should have gone into more detail for you.   The people who are vaccinated are far less likely to have any sort of adverse reaction if they catch COVID. There are still a small percentage of people who will experience a breakthrough case even if they are fully vaccinated and become sick, but it will not be life threatening.  A vaccine passport is to prevent the normans who won’t get vaccinated from joining large crowds and gatherings, preventing the nearly guaranteed spread amongst that group of people and stopping different variants from popping up among the general population. It is a public health initiative. Your rights aren’t being taken away from you because of a vaccine passport. You can go take the shot and join the rest of the vaccinated world, or you can wait. There are private businesses who will dictate the terms and conditions on which you can enter, protecting their employees and other customers is their priority. If they say you need to be vaccinated to enter or participate in events, well that’s tough luck to the unvaccinated. The unvaccinated will have to do curb side pickup and delivery for the things they need and watch from the sidelines.  Look at the case rate now in the United States compared to the case rate last year from when lockdowns were initiated. During lockdowns, the average was +50,000 cases each day or so, but hospitalizations were exploding. Compared to now, where in the United States the average is 100,000 cases each day, hospitalizations are dramatically reduced. That is entirely due to the vaccine. This theme plays out in every single country that has a population that is vaccinated.  A vaccine passport gets us to herd immunity quicker, gets us out of this pandemic quicker, and gets us back to a semi-normal life quicker. Why should I, a person who is fully vaccinated, be stopped from going on with my life because a group of uneducated normans refuse to take the shot? A lot of these people claim it’s because the shot isn’t fully FDA approved yet, but what will their excuse be when it is approved? It’s expected to be fully approved within the next 2 or 3 months, so what then? Something tells me reactionaries and contrarians will always be against it, and they will find a new reason to not want it.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/ozby0m/vaccination_appointments_double_in_quebec_after/h82t5rl/

That is not sufficient for such overbearing and authoritarian policies""  Well I live in Winnipeg and during our last wave our ICUs were so over run that we were sending patients to other provinces. People died in transit because we couldn't provide them proper care here. If we had continued down this road it could have been catastrophic for our population. This is a huge reason  why people want to be extra cautious here and I think a very valid one.  The vaccine passport would not be infringing on anyone's rights as defined in our charter of freedoms. This isn't discrimination and anyone has the right to be vaccinated at no cost. You can call it medical coercion but in the end you pose a risk to society by choosing not to be vaccinated. We have plenty of laws already in place that work in similar ways. Nobody is ever going to lose essential services and only luxury goods/services.

I can call it medical coercion because that's exactly what this is, and it's unethical.  The risk unvaccinated pose to society is vastly vastly overstated and I've run through the numbers a lot in this thread.  An unvaccinated person poses next to no risk to you a vaccinated person.  And since we have controlled for the vulnerable populations through vaccinations we now have much more reason for optimism.  For example 75% of deaths originated from LTC.  Since controlling for that deaths have plummeted since March and we can expect ongoing deaths to be a fraction of what they once were.  No need to compare this to Nazi Germany.  But don't disregard the Patriot Act example which clearly demonstrates how intrusive and overbearing government policies get ushered in under states of emergency and remain in place long after the emergency has ended.  We have no real reason to believe that once this vaccine passport infrastructure is in place that it will simply be disregarded once the pandemic is over.  On the contrary we should fear that it's use is expanded on.

3179,7,1628381455,"I think the issue with ICUs is more reflective of the state of our healthcare system than anything else.  I'm from Ontario and long before COVID hit we were having discussions about ""hallway medicine"".  &gt; Every day, Ontario hospitals put nearly 1,000 patients in what the province's health ministry calls ""unconventional spaces,"" such as hallways, meeting rooms and storage areas.  Behind all those numbers are the patients affected by hospital overcrowding: waiting more than 24 hours in the emergency department before getting admitted to a bed, spending their hospital stay in a makeshift spot, such as a converted exercise room, or facing repeated delays for surgery because all post-op beds are full.  https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-hallway-medicine-hospital-overcrowding-patients-1.5443172  This was the state of our healthcare pre-covid.  And you're starting to lose me on this one.  If we can agree to some extent that the risk remains small then we should be in agreement that vaccine passports are not required.  The policy is genuinely authoritarian in nature.  The health minister has openly stated it is for the purpose of ""compliance"".  This opens up the debate to the ethics of medical coercion, which I hope we can both agree is a bad outcome.  The state should never pressure citizens into receiving medical treatment, particularly when the risk is small as we have agreed.  We need to start asking ourselves what kind of society we want to live in post-covid.  You have to be extremely vigilant in states of emergency as it is the prime opportunity for ambitious governments to further their agendas. This means calling out governments when they extend their reach too far under the guise of an emergency.  The Patriot Act signed after the 9/11 attacks is a good example of how laws enacted under a state of emergency tend to stick around. Signed in by Bush and extended thereafter by Obama. The patriot act gave the US government wide ranging surveillance powers previously unavailable to it. This is the focus of the Snowden controversy.

[Here is an article](https://www.businessinsider.com/covid-transmission-vaccinated-people-risk-of-resistant-variant-2021-7) detailing their concerns of where this could lead.  Excerpt:  &gt;The coronavirus could be ""just a few mutations potentially away"" from evolving into a variant that can evade existing COVID-19 vaccines, CDC director Rochelle Walensky said Tuesday. According to research published Friday in the journal Scientific Reports, vaccinated people — counterintuitively — play a key role in that risk.   &gt;   &gt;The best way to stop coronavirus deaths and severe illness is to roll out vaccines quickly. However, the researchers concluded that the chance a vaccine-resistant strain will emerge is highest in a scenario that combines three conditions: First, a large portion of a population is vaccinated, but not everyone. Second, there's a lot of virus circulating. And third, no measures are in place to curb potential viral transmission from vaccinated people.   &gt;   &gt;That scenario describes several Canadian provinces right now, like Alberta and Manitoba. Country-wide vaccine passports are probably our best chance at avoiding that result... at least here in Canada. Unless we want everything we've done since March 2020 to be undone, more people need to get vaccinated to slow the spread.

Take a second and pretend we're not all fucked up and desperate after a year of lock downs and examine this idea. Do you sincerely believe corruption cannot exist in this world? I suggest looking at history or hell, a number of contemporary societies and a documentary or two about large capitalist interests, gov parties screwing or controlling people who dissent.  If that system gets even a hair of corruption, this platform can exist as a means of erasing citizens for civil disobedience, objection to gov, or a threat to a capital interest... it wont matter weather they've had 2 vaccines and a booster or not if the system doesn't show it.     *""You can decide to get vaccinated with absolutely no valid reason""* How much time have you spent looking at the science and following the debates on this behind parroted slogans and news channels?  There are quite rational people...scientists, virologists, nobel prize winners, people at the top of their field or involved in the invention of MRNA technology still asking questions and the answers aren't all in.  What is happening, however, is equivalent to book burning in terms of scientific debate.  Censorship, smear campaigns, people risking their careers to ask questions. It's a concerning time in scientific/intellectual history. Make whatever choice you want, hate people for being hesitant if you want, but a certain % of people are uncomfortable while there are still gaps in the literature, and not without rational reason.      *Variants:*   Please keep in mind, that vaccinations reduce chances of becoming very ill, hospitalizations and death.  You can still get and spread covid while being vaccinated.  74% of individuals in this sample were vaccinated and carrying a transmittable load of Covid.  Out of a further sample of 133, 90% were carrying Delta.   Yes, non vaccinated people will typically carry higher viral loads, but please consider some nuance in your framing of non vaccinated as the only source of continued spread/variant.

Yes.  If the hospitalization rates dropped dramatically, we should absolutely not impose unnecessary punishment to citizens. To wish for ""zero COVID"" is absolute madness. If we reached a level where hospitals are not overcharged then there's no reasonable justification for punishing people, and I say that by having taken both doses. I'm extremely concerned about my privacy and I hate the idea of imposing vaccine passports to citizens when we have multiple examples around the world (mainly UK) where cases and deaths are extremely low despite the delta variant and despite they having lifted all restrictions.  Game theory could indicate that imposing a vaccine passport would possibly backfire and simply fortify those who are anti-vaccines in their beliefs. There's clearly a decent % of Canadians who believe this is a very bad idea.

3315,21,1628150696,"Ya, it can be a hard thing to discuss.    There is kind of a false dichotomy about it, and people sometimes react really strongly if they perceive you as being on the other side as them.   On the one hand I don't want to be wishy washy.   On the other it's a big philosophical question and I won't claim to have any answer I think it's completely right.  That said I feel like I should present a position to my just be like a wishy washy devil's advocate or whatever....  I'm not a great believer in a social contract.  As an individual, I don't think that I should be required to suspend or diminish my personal rights to a serious extent at the behest of a greater public good.  I don't get to apply this to benefits granted to me by and shared with that public however.    With driving, I'm using a public service.  I feel compelled to use a driver's license because the road is a shared good, paid for and benefiting a great number of people.   If I was driving a vehicle over public land, or land that I owned, or a boat over the ocean, there would be a lot less personal responsibility toward the public.  And generally, there are very different, and much less stringent legal requirements (in many cases none at all, though this is of course variable) for driving on private land, boats, etc.   With driving, there is a very clear exchange occurring between the individual and the public.    Something like a vaccine passport could certainly be morally applied to specific examples (subjectively of course, I can only speak for myself)- a business having requirements for its customers, a hospital for its staff, etc.     But as soon as you are preventing people from assembling together in general public, or you are restricting their ability to move and affiliate freely, you are seriously damaging the underlying assumptions of a social contract we all on some level recognize.  We agree to live in a society and exchange some of our personal freedoms because it benefits us.   One of the biggest aspects of this is in provisioning us with certain rights as citizens.  I struggle to see an exchange for the individual with some possible applications of the restriction of rights we are discussing here.   Certainly a notion of improved public safety, but that's a lot hazier than taxes, driving licenses, not stealing from people, etc.    The other aspect to this is a problem of egality.   One of the downsides to our providing this to all citizens is that we aren't all equal.  We do have some right to behave irresponsibly, and to what degree it endangers others is also to what degree we restrict those behaviors socially and legally.  There aren't legal requirements to behave intelligently, or in an educated way.   There is no law that says you can't be stupid, and that's as it should be.   There are lots of people who I think are stupid, and I for one would fight for them to have that option haha, I hope that makes sense, I'm a little tired.    The burden of action to actually lose your fundamental freedoms is fairly high.  Going to prison, being put under house arrest, probation.   Not wearing your seatbelt, or not using a driver's license certainly has consequences, but these consequences don't prevent you from being able to assemble or travel freely.     So to me, these examples don't equate too well due to entailing very different consequences, and very different exchanges.    I think that, not wanting to take a vaccine, is simply not a severe enough act to merit the severe punishment of significantly restricted rights, and preventing assembly.     There has been historical precedent for reducing freedoms in times of emergency.   Draft, rationing, increasing taxes, martial law.   Some have been used to the public benefit, some have very much not.    I think it's important to recognize what we are talking about though.     Having to wear a mask in public under threat of a fine, or not being able to go to really crowded night clubs for a period of time is VERY different from not allowing people to leave the country, or assemble in public, or attend a protest.   I'm very much in favor of things aligned with the former, and very much against the latter.   Ultimately, people need to be allowed to behave as freely as they wish without hurting others.   I think that if they aren't, it's indicative of a failure of public education, and punishment is not necessarily a productive means to the end of having a more responsible public.   Okay that's a lot.  I hope it doesn't seem like i just want to hear myself talk or that I've been condescending in spelling something out too much.

A lot of people are saying ""If we were to trust the WHO, why did we mix"" but then ""If we don't trust the WHO, we should have mixed"".   The misunderstanding is that the Sinovac and Sputnik V are both less effective against the delta Variant than the MRNA vaccines.  A lot of developing nations do not have the scientific agencies to research and come up with their own research findings and rely on a global organization like the WHO for scientific guidance. Canada/US and the EU can make up their own mines because we have agencies that can do that research.   Because of the rise of the Delta Variant, the WHO is advising on a global level to not mix vaccines due to limited supply and people with Sinovac and Sputnik V clamouring to eat up the existing MRNA supply. People in Thailand are triple vaccinating and there are other countries scrambling to get even single doses.   &gt; However, while Canada has doled out both the European-made version of the AstraZeneca jab and its Indian-made counterpart – known as Covishield – Brussels has only approved the European-made version.

First, as custom dictates, I will state that I've been fully dosed and I still think vaccine passports are dystopian BS.  Second, I'll address your statement here: Is it really honest to call something a ""choice"" when the alternative is to be ostracized from society and barred from public spaces (or at best, segregated)? I mean sure, no one is coming to arrest you for not taking the shot (yet...), but to call it a free choice is a bit disingenuous I think.  Third, leaving aside the murky ethical waters of covid 19 vaccines, I think this whole conversation (the overall public discourse, not just this comment thread) needs to be reframed. We talk about vaccine passports like some kind of isolated public health tool, instead of what they really are: social credit passes. Right now, their scope is confined to COVID and your vaccination status, but that could easily change. So, when you mull the prospect of a vaccine passport, I think you have to be honest with yourself about where you stand on the question of social credit passes in general. I can see the argument for them, but the potential for abuse is also very high as it confers a great deal of power to whoever gets to decide what is pro-social and what is anti-social behaviour.

3572,29,1626399258,"Indeed, these are side effects, and they do come at a risk.  When doing the risk analysis though there is the risk to others to take into account, unless one doesn't care about them.  The side effects you just listed are very similar to those of COVID, and there are risks associated with that as well.  The common trend that seems to be occurring is it is damage due to inflammation, so things like heart damage, and even erectile dysfunction are possible outcomes.  When you factor in others, the risk profile changes.  There is so much talk about not limiting peoples activities, and how the idea of vaccine passports will create a dual class society, etc. but all these arguments are self centred and don't take into account others.  A proper vaccine passport system would not reveal any information about you, what vaccines you had, or even if you're vaccinated.  All that is needed is that you've been verified.  There are three options I can see here that could qualify:  1. You are fully vaccinated (regardless of vaccine type). 2. You can't be vaccinated due to a medical reason that is backed up by a doctor. 3. You are a conscientious objector.  When going about your business, or travelling, the only question to answer is, are you verified.  The answer should be yes or no.  Another factor is date sensitivity, but that doesn't effect the answer, it is still yes or no.  In theory, everyone can be verified by one of the three things above.  Option 3 should be the hardest to obtain, due to it being a weak point in our society, but perhaps all that is needed is a quick online course talking about vaccines and why they are beneficial and you can get verified.  As for other people.  If you are one of the unlucky few who can't get vaccinated, eg. allergies or within a group that doesn't have an approved vaccine, then you are being put at risk by others who choose to ""take their own risks"" and not get vaccinated.  When someone who can't be vaccinated goes grocery shopping, for example, they don't have the luxury of deciding for themselves if they should or should not get protected, the are forced to be unprotected.  That is why it is up to everyone else who is able to get vaccinated to do so, to reach and exceed herd immunity.  It is clear than each person is able to make their own choices about what they allow into their body, but it doesn't mean that the greater society needs to accept their choice.  They are free to not get vaccinated and they are free to exclude themselves.  It is heartless, but they are a risk to everyone.    On top of this, the vaccines aren't 100% effective, so they aren't just putting those who can't get vaccinated at risk, they are putting everyone at risk.  I'm sure that individual doesn't want to cause others harm, like _life long heart damage, nerve issues, death, and other not yet reported side effects._  It is up to all of us to work together, to the best of our abilities, to have a happy, healthy society.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/okzvdg/were_not_gonna_have_a_split_society_ontario/h5chd5e/

The entire Schengen zone has already implemented national vaccine passport systems, which is waaaaay better than Canada will ever do.  For the US, plenty of immigration-related documents used by the Canadian government can be validated by swearing to their authenticity in front of a notary public. This should be sufficient for vaccine records as well. Will there be a tiny minority of people who will perjure themselves to fraudulently claim they are vaccinated? Yeah, probably, but the extra cost of notarizing documents is likely to filter most of that out, and there are other important documents that also fit that bill.  This is obviously not necessarily applicable to, say, India or Brazil, and there are additional issues with which vaccines are being used (e.g. Chinese or Russian vaccines not approved in Canada) but we need to start opening borders with our strategic allies.

And other countries have rules requiring proof of vaccination, which the vaccination passport is expected to be the standard method of satisfying.   The whole purpose of them is to facilitate travel *between* provinces, and *between* countries.  &gt;Courts have so far held up everything related to provinces putting restrictions and regulations on travel in to them during this, so why do you think it's suddenly not up to provinces who they let in their borders or rules related to it?  Firstly, there aren't any appellate decisions in Canada on this point yet. That means that none of those decisions set precedent, and no court in Canada is actually bound by any of those decisions (though they are of persuasive value).  But I didn't say it's not up to the provinces. I said this is squarely within federal jurisdiction -- there's a considerable difference. The double aspect doctrine means that it can be within the jurisdiction of *both* the federal and provincial governments, but considering that these passports are, in fact, anticipated to see some international use, it would make a lot of sense to have a single standard document (and it directly engages the feds' jurisdiction over foreign policy and quarantines). It would also prevent cases where the provinces have different standards of proof for entry, different standards for the issuance of a vaccine passport, or where they might refuse to recognize vaccination documents of a given province.   It's also not at all clear from the decisions that have upheld provincial entry restrictions that they would continue to be upheld now that the battle with the pandemic is nearly won. The arguments pre-vaccine would not hold the same weight with half the country fully vaccinated and nearly 80% with the first dose. It directly undermines the degree to which the legislative objective is pressing and substantial (to use the verbiage of the Oakes test, the relevant legal test), and thereby shifts the proportionality analysis when the court balances the anticipated benefits of the policy with the degree to which it undermines charter protected rights.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/ojo7fq/trudeau_says_hell_leave_domestic_vaccine/h53qnzg/

3704,11,1625773228,"I edited my comment above to provide more info (I accidentally hit post early). It is not rare for kids to catch and spread COVID, at least not now. When you see that Delta is largely spreading amongst unvaccinated people, what isn't mentioned is that most of those people are kids. In some countries they're accounting for like 1/2 of the cases. As mentioned, it has a low rate of causing MIS-C (multisystem inflammation syndrome) which can cause severe damage that will impact them for the rest of their life if it doesn't kill them. Delta is more concerning for this reason (I think Alpha also caused this but isn't super common in Canada, but the original strain of COVID largely did not).  &gt; You can't advocate for that. People should talk to THEIR doctor and determine if it's right for them. People shouldn't be taking medical advice from government officials, celebrities, online commentators or anyone other than their doctor.  Then I encourage those people to go talk to their doctor, and their doctor will almost certainly tell them that they should get vaccinated - unless they're one of those VERY small number of people who can't, or their doctor is an anti-vaxxer nutjob who doesn't care about committing malpractice (also very rare).  &gt; Not to enter restaurants, bars, gyms, etc. And not for something that isn't even a cure. The vaccine helps, but it's not a cure for anything.  I don't know about restaurants/bars etc specifically, but vaccine passports have been used to control attendance at events. They were used to control attendance at pilgrimage sites even 100 years ago which were places plague was typically spread in large numbers.  No vaccine is a cure. Polio did not have a cure, but the vaccine passports for it were used to control people's movements + registrations for school etc anyway.  We've already used vaccination documentation for school registration and schools are a public space. There's no sense in NOT using it for restaurants/bars/gyms etc. Those are private businesses that can choose to use the passport if they want, or not - but many likely will, because the majority of people are getting vaccinated and at least in the short-term many parents will not feel comfortable bringing their kids into spaces where unvaccinated people are accepted (while their kids are still unable to get vaxxed).",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/ogc0x1/covid19_quebec_will_implement_a_vaccination/h4icse8/

3706,13,1625773757,"&gt; Yet, no vaccine passport was ever used to control my freedom of movement inside my own country.  Your attendance at schools has been dictated by your vaccinations, so yes, it has. I'm 30 years old and I had vaccination records too. Without them, I would not have been attending public school. That's a public space -- this vaccine passport will be used for inter-provincial travel presumably, but also for private businesses, which will be able to choose whether to use it or not - but many people will not feel comfortable going into private businesses that make no effort to push people to get vaccinated.  &gt; I don't care. Taking the whole population as hostages with this ridiculous passport and using blackmail to force people to vaccinate is a slippery slope and I find it very worrying that my fellow citizens, like you, are willing to give the governement this power over us.  Nobody is taking anybody hostage. If you don't want to get vaccinated you don't have to. But it may mean not being able to go to Quebec in the near future, or go into private businesses there that choose not to let unvaccinated people in. This isn't a difference of opinion or some ideological difference - it's a vaccine, and if people choose not to take it they face the consequences. The biggest one of which is, you know, possibly catching and spreading a deadly disease.  The gov't *already* has this power over us and they mostly don't use it. They're using it in this case because it makes sense. Letting people walk around with a deadly communicable disease and spread it all over without consequences makes no sense when the vaccines are widely available to everybody who wants one (except kids under 12).  &gt; It's not about preventing travel?  I didn't say it wasn't about preventing travel, you're making up something I didn't even say. It clearly is about preventing travel, that's the point. They don't want people coming into Quebec and spreading COVID.   &gt; Is literaly about filter people and getting kind of a cast system, where vaccinated people have more fundamental rights than non-vaccinated people.   Firstly, a caste system is an ethnographic system. This has nothing to do with that. Secondly, if you're insinuating that unvaccinated people will be treated as second-class citizens: they won't be. They have the same rights as everybody else. **Including the right to get a vaccine at a time of their choosing for free.**  Not getting vaccinated is a CHOICE.

3801,1,1623882048,"The show must go on. But if you got the AstraZeneca vaccine, you’re not invited.  Canadians who got that shot will not, at least for now, be allowed in seats for “Springsteen on Broadway” the first production since the famous theatres went dark at the start of the pandemic.  “It’s just plain not fair,” said University of Toronto bioethicist Kerry Bowman. While the Canada-U.S. border is closed to non-essential travel, it’s expected to open soon, and though making it to a show is not a life-or-death situation, “it’s a huge problem.”  It could also be just the beginning of bureaucratic vaccine woes, as the world starts to reopen with a patchwork of different approved shots.  “From an ethical point of view it’s very difficult, because what has happened is people have made their commitment to being vaccinated for their own health and the health of their communities and the world, and people are turning their nose up at it,” Bowman said.  AstraZeneca was approved by Health Canada, but not by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. First doses have since been stopped in Ontario due to safety issues with blood clots, but many have opted to go ahead with second shots or mix with Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna.  According to a Q and A posted on the theatre’s website, guests at “Springsteen on Broadway,” an intimate show featuring The Boss performing solo starting June 26, will need to be fully vaccinated with an FDA-approved jab. That means at least two weeks days after a second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna. Or at least 14 days after the one-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson Janssen vaccine.  Guests will have to provide proof of vaccination from their health-care provider on a smartphone, or with a physical copy.  Sadly for the many GenXers who got AstraZeneca firmly in Springsteen’s demo, “at the direction of New York state only FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson) will be accepted.”  The only exception is for children under 16, who must be taken by a vaccinated adult and provide proof of a negative rapid COVID test taken within six hours of the performance, or a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test taken within 72 hours.  The theatre and the New York governor’s office did not respond to requests for comments by deadline.  The no-AZ policy touches on a larger problem, said Bowman: the lack of international co-ordination on a registry of acceptable vaccines, that will become more of a problem as countries start to open up again.  “As we roll into 2022 there’s going to be just this mosaic of different vaccine backgrounds that people have and there’s got to be an A list,” he said. “We have got to figure this out.”  AstraZeneca has been used in a number of jurisdictions, including Britain, he notes.  China and Russia have their own vaccines, which are already being used beyond their borders. Brazil is buying the single-shot Chinese vaccine, and Algeria is administering Russia’s Sputnik V, neither of which is approved by the FDA or Health Canada.  This means “people coming back into Canada who have had vaccines not recognized in Canada will have the same problem” as those barred from Broadway, said Kelley Lee, a professor and Canada Research Chair in Global Health Governance at Simon Fraser University.  “It’s a real reflection of how chaotic it’s been. Countries adopted their own travel measures when the pandemic occurred and now when they’re trying to ease them, it’s no surprise.”  The level of vaccination in different countries, as well as testing and quarantine protocols, also varies, said Lee, who noted the vaccine passport idea has been driven by industry groups “keen to get business going,” and not the World Health Organization. It will be really important to follow the “real-world data on vaccine efficacy” to know which ones work.  “We would ideally need a global system that would give everyone the same treatment in terms of their immunization status and it would be reliable and secure,” she said. “We don’t have anything like that.”  With almost 60 per cent of adults fully vaccinated, New York City is roaring back to life, well beyond Broadway, and proof of vaccination is increasingly the golden ticket to join in the fun.  Several late-night shows have opened up tapings to live audiences again, but they, too, need to be fully vaccinated. According to NBC’s website, AZ does not make the cut for “Saturday Night Live,” or “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”  New York state has also launched the Excelsior Pass, which lets you share you vaccine or negative test status on your phone with a QR code, and provides access to theatres, stadiums, and other events. For now it’s only open to those who have been fully vaccinated in the state.  Things are starting to open up, but Lee added that it’s important to recognize we’re still in a transition phase, especially globally.  “I think we need to be patient, and I think Americans are getting a little more impatient,” she said.  “I have had AstraZeneca so I guess I won’t be able to go to Broadway.”",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/o1gq4n/burn_in_the_usa_canadians_who_got_the_astrazeneca/h20sdra/

A PCR test is the most reliable diagnostic test but still far from perfect with the chances of getting a false negative ranging from 20% to 100% depending on when you had been exposed if true. For screening passengers at an airport, it's highly unsuitable because it's not ""quick"" as the interviewed CEO claims. It takes between 1-3 days to get the results in Canada.  The quicker but much less reliable test is the antigen test (different from the antibody test which is also unreliable compared to PCR). You could get results from the antigen test in as soon as 15 minutes, but the trade-off is speed for accuracy. This is more likely to yield a false negative compared to PCR, and defeats the purpose of COVID testing.  [Here are the testing regimes at some airports around the world](https://www.businesstraveller.com/features/which-airports-are-offering-covid-19-tests/).

3871,1,1622836124,"&gt; It’s been about 14 months since the border with the U.S. was closed. The time to start reopening it has arrived. And somehow the government of Canada is not ready.  &gt; This is one of those cases where a sudden blanket measure was put in place because of an emergency and, now that there are better ways to deal with it, there is too much sleepy inertia getting in the way.  &gt; So snap out of it, Ottawa. People who have been fully vaccinated can safely travel across borders without quarantining. Govern yourselves – and all of us – accordingly.  &gt; That’s not a political opinion. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded fully vaccinated people are good to go across borders, without quarantine. Last week, Health Canada’s own Expert Advisory Panel said the same thing.  &gt; In May, the Biden Administration suggested talks on reopening, but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau played down the idea.  &gt; While Mr. Trudeau’s government is dawdling over it, two Liberal MPs, Wayne Easter and Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, banded together with a U.S. Representative from western New York State, Brian Higgins, to call for government to start phasing in a reopening of the border – starting with dropping quarantine requirements for people who can show proof they are fully vaccinated.  &gt; “We really do need to exercise greater urgency – given the evidence, given the science that we know, that it is safe for fully vaccinated individuals to travel,” Mr. Erskine-Smith said in a telephone interview.  &gt; That Canadian Expert Advisory Panel didn’t suggest dropping all border measures, but revamping to make them smarter. The recommendations notably included cancelling the mandatory three-day hotel quarantine for air travellers because it is inconsistent, inconvenient and of marginal value in preventing the spread of COVID-19.  &gt; Instead, on Thursday, the government increased the penalty for skipping out of hotel quarantine from $3,000 to $5,000.  &gt; It’s hard to imagine the hotel quarantine was ever much use, but it was implemented to beef up the blunt message the government wanted to send: Travel = Bad.  &gt; The thing is, Canada now needs to move to another message: Vaccination = Freedom.  &gt; Goldy Hyder, the chief executive officer of the Business Council of Canada, said the freedom to travel is a powerful incentive to get vaccinated. The benefit of being fully vaccinated should be the ability to travel, within Canada and abroad.  &gt; “COVID put us under house arrest. Vaccines give you mobility freedom. Or they should,” Mr. Hyder said. “What are we waiting for?”  &gt; One reason for Canada’s sluggish approach might be a political fear that opening the border to fully vaccinated people now might draw attention to the fact that, for the next month or two, there will be a lot more Americans that are fully vaccinated while Canadians are still in what Mr. Trudeau called a “one-dose summer.”  &gt; Maybe Mr. Trudeau figures it’s easier to wait till the end of August, when it will be closer to an expected fall election, too.  &gt; There are more practical concerns. There’s a question of whether a Canadian “vaccine passport” would be issued by the federal government and, if so, whether the provinces will share vaccination data with Ottawa. There’s also the issue of what documents from the U.S. and other countries would be accepted as proof of vaccination.  &gt; But surely, Ottawa should have seen that coming. If they’re not ready after all this time, they’d better get a move on.  &gt; Some European Union countries already have such documents, and international air-travel organizations are working on standard formats. Several U.S. states have their own certificates, and phone apps.  &gt; “Surely we can figure this out, as between Canada and the United States, much more quickly – given the friends, families and business interests that live across both borders, and work across both borders,” Mr. Erskine-Smith said.  &gt; Canada’s tourism sector would be better off even with just a partial reopening of the border. A little more business travel would be good for the economy, too. It’s also just a good message to send that Canada will welcome anyone who has had two shots.  &gt; “Its good for our economy, and it is good for our brand,” Mr. Hyder said.  &gt; It’s more than that. Governments have a duty to open up freedoms as much as possible when it is so low-risk. Canada’s has fallen asleep on its pandemic border policies.

Currently the ICV is only used for yellow fever, but in the past it has been used for other transmissible diseases including for travel between developed countries. The international agreements and infrastructure for vaccine passports have existed since 1933 and have been a legally binding part of international law since 1969.

With that said, I have practised as I preached and questioned the science and research of the mRNA and AstraZeneca vaccines, and it all looks very good from an efficacy and safety standpoint.  I mean that.  I've been vaccinated and would encourage everyone to get vaccinated.  The morbidity statistics show that I am not particularly at risk from a bad outcome if I were to contract it, but what drives me, and what should be a larger factor for others, is the risk associated with contracting it and then spreading it to a more vulnerable individual.

Not just them, but the older parents and Grandparents of people across the country.    Are there ""slippery slope"" arguments to be made here with respect to a vaccine passport?  Yes.

3970,11,1621726807,"&gt; why do we need to get a NEW passport when we can continue using a system that's already been in place since forever.  Honest answer?  Because enforcement is mainly going to be done by the airlines (travel is a right, boarding a plane is a ""privilege"").  Countries can't deny Citizens right of entry (generally), but they can (for example) make the airlines have proof of vaccination before you board an aircraft home.  The IATA (the people who standardize things like boarding passes) have a digital system for vaccine verification.  It's designed to be scannable by app, and is mathematically unforgeable.  When linked to name and DOB, it's essentially impossible for most people to circumvent.  It's a similar transformation to what we've seen with passports.  Instead of showing your passport at the airport, apps now scan the chip in your passport to verify all the information on it before you even get there.  Likewise, instead of showing a vaccination record at the airport, an electronic vaccination record can be scanned and verified by the app before you get to the airport.

Which in a way it’s okay because it’s kind of irrelevant. Ontario for example is doing like a third of the number of tests it was doing a few weeks ago. Positivity rates are high, higher than even some of the peaks, but numbers are  lower now because we’re testing way less.   I think vaccines actually working and a lot of of the people who have it just don’t know or get tested, or maybe vaccines prevent spreading enough that it’s actually not spreading as much now. We don’t know. Things are working. Way less people feel the need to get a test now and only those with moderate symptoms actually get it done which skews the higher positivity rate.   Which brings me to my point, all of this is irrelevant. In a future where hopefully 70% or more of our population is vaccinated, what’s the passport going to do? At 30% first dose alone it’s already working, what happens when we get to US levels and beyond in the next 2 months? Would I really care if a person attending a concert a few seats from me or sitting at the same restaurant isn’t vaccinated? If they transmit anything to me, it won’t matter. My vaccine works and that’s why I’m living life normally. If I were to transmit something to them? Even if it’s a lower chance, I’m transferring a virus that’s like x1000 more effective against them. They’re putting themselves as significantly more risk by being around me unvaccinated.   And if they choose to do that for whatever reason, they can take the risk and suffer the consequence.

3986,27,1621753798,"&gt; Which would be safer, data in the code or link to to a site?   ""Safer"" really depends on the specific type of attack.  The big advantage to a URL in a QR code is that it can be verified by anyone, and doesn't require an app.  It is possible to forge this by making a similar-sounding site.  You could split the difference and require large venues to verify using an app (that makes sure it's on a provincial website), but that requires 100% uptime, and internet connectivity everywhere.  It also essentially requires the vaccine record to be sent to the government before it goes live.  As far as safety goes, you can do that smart, or you can do that stupid.  If the server gets hacked, everyone's data is stolen.  If you assign QR codes sequentially (something like ?id=1), then someone could go through and get all the data easily.  If you secure the server appropriately, and pick random unguessable IDs, then it's fine.  The system we built is a little nicer, in that it doesn't require a central repository.  Specifically, it's designed for federation.  In other words, we don't require the Middlesex Ontario health unit to send all the data to Ontario to put up on vaccinepassport.on.ca.    We use smart card readers and SIM cards (same chip in credit cards) to allow the secure generation of vaccine certs, with some magic that allows the government to say ""the London Optimist Vaccine clinic got Pfizer batch XYZ, and can administer up to ZZZ shots"".  The person's name and batch number are entered into the computer, it's checked to make sure that the data is valid, and then a QR code is immediately generated.  With our approach, we don't need a central database at all, which can be highly privacy preserving.  For places like Texas and Florida (that ban vaccine passports), this is a great thing.  The QR code can be printed out right there, the computer is booted off a read-only, non-connected computer, and the person walks out with the vaccine record.  What they do with it is entirely up to them.  The upside to our approach is that there doesn't have to be a central database to hack, and even if an attacker gets in, they can't forge the information.  Someone with access to the database can't impersonate or alter data, and people from one clinic can't fake a record from another clinic or generate extra vaccine records.  Our system can also verify without needing internet access at all (as the signature is in the barcode), and unlike internet-connected systems doesn't let the government see how many people are using it, where, and when.  But, if you put those on a server (so that people can use an app to put it in their wallet), and you do something like have people login with their health card number instead of scanning the record (because people lose their record), then you get back to all the same problems that happen with the first situation.  &gt; Do you think the QR code in general is a good way to go about it?  From the standpoint of achieving policy objectives, given the current system we have?  Yes.  For people in BC, no, but that's because I know a few things that aren't generally talked about.  The BC health cards have a NFC smart card in them, running software that's linked to GCKey (a project between the government of Canada and Visa/MC).  These chips are essentially unclonable, and with the right software easy to talk to.  For people in BC, the best way to do it would be to put a virtual credential on their health card, then allow it to dynamically generate QR codes.  These could be completely privacy protecting, and when coupled with some software we use to match faces to photos, essentially anonymous.  You would tap your card to your phone before entering the venue, it would encode some facial data and a signature into a unique barcode, and then that could be checked at the gate.  You'd get all the benefits with that approach of a vaccine passport, without giving any health or personal information to the venue at all.

4037,4,1621529518,"It's still looking like it'll be much like last summer. For everyday life, Trudeau's ""one-dose summer"" for 2021 is as good as the zero-dose summer of 2020. The novelty won't go down as well this summer when the USA will re-experience something closer to 2019 given how they'll begin the season with a much larger share of the population being **fully** vaccinated than we will.  Rhetorical question: Does being half-vaccinated already grant those people exemptions from current mockdowns or other restrictions here? Captain Obvious' answer: No / Non / Nein / Nyet / Nie / Nem / Hayır. The headlines about how so many of us are half-vaccinated can be dazzling but they obscure the reality that it hasn't done anything other than contribute recently to smaller rates of daily additions to cases, hospitalization and death (lockdowns/mockdowns and travel restrictions are the other contributors).  Whether they've crunched the numbers or not, Ontarians, at the least, aren't that off-base to anticipate another lost summer despite all of the government hopium on the rollout from larger deliveries and ""record-breaking"" vaccination rates.  For Ontario, it'll take about 8.5 weeks for PHUs to vaccinate an estimated 9 million remaining adults to be fully vaccinated at an average throughput of 150,000 doses per day (i.e. the current daily maximum nowadays) for the duration. I exclude 1.5 million adults who are anti-vaxx and another 1.5 million who will be fully vaccinated by the time Ontario finally scraps the 16-week gamble). When we factor in teenagers (estimated 750,000 between ages 12 and 15) getting at least the first shot of Pfizer in time for the new school year, it'll probably increase this duration to about 9.5 weeks or 10 weeks rounded up.  If Ontario were to start going whole hog on second doses as of June 15, then it'd be around August 20 when the province would finish the vaccination of **all** adults and giving first doses to teenagers. The average boomer could expect to be fully vaccinated around Canada Day. The average millennial could expect to be fully vaccinated around Civic Holiday.  If Ontario were to start going whole hog on second doses as of July 1, then it'd be around **Labour Day** when the province would finish the job. The average boomer could expect to be fully vaccinated by the last week of July. The average millennial could expect to be fully vaccinated by the last week of August.  Whether we actually have a better summer or not hinges on both daily throughput (which traces back to deliveries/inflow from the Feds) and when we stop grossly prioritizing giving out first doses. If PHUs in Ontario were able to double their combined average daily throughput from 150,000 doses to 300,000 doses, and start prioritizing second doses even as late as July 1, then it'd take around 4 weeks to finish giving out second doses to 9 million adults, and all of us could have a salvageable and noticeably better summer from Civic Holiday onward, at the least.  Telling me though that I can go hiking or hang out on a patio again this summer are activities that I could do last summer when we had no vaccine. Only when I see real action by governments and public health on removing barriers to travel (including quarantines), an internationally-recognized vaccine passport that's very hard to forge, the near-total, if not total, removal of indoor capacity restrictions for public spaces, and masks being optional, then we could say that we'd be getting somewhere.

4038,5,1621530702,"The commissioners are correct in identifying that a *vaccine passport* system is an encroachment on the civil liberties of Canadians.  It's possible that a limited type of system could be reasonably implemented at international entry points into Canada, where entrants are required to present a clean bill of health before stepping onto Canadian soil.  However, it's unreasonable to apply such a system to Canadians entering Canadian provinces, counties, cities, or even buildings.  It opens the door to a further erosion and stripping of the hard-won freedoms and privacy enshrined by Canada.  Such a system will be extremely difficult (if not impossible) to implement effectively, without breaching the privacy and freedoms that Canadians currently hold.  But such a system will undoubtedly be even more difficult to decommission once implemented.  The online poll referred to in the article surveyed 1.5 *thousand* Canadians, and it's unreasonable to translate those results to imply 80% of 38 *million* Canadians agree with it.  While it may become a contentious and divisive issue, it should be deferred to a Canada-wide referendum, where Canadians can express their desire for or against such a system, after informing and educating themselves on the long term implications and risks of the said system once all details are laid out.   By no means should Canadians permit free reign of the Canadian government on this issue, to unilaterally implement such a system without their clear say, especially with its record in recent years.  The possibilities of such a passport is echoed through history, and it's highly likely to open a floodgate of new abuses, divisions, prejudices, and worse.

4047,14,1621597315,"Opinion piece advocating for adoption of framework similar to EU for border re-opening, with some sort of vaccine passport until the pandemic has passed.  Article notes that given the higher percentage of Americans fully vaccinated, the opening of the border will initially mean a one-way flow of Americans into Canada.  The authors observed this will give a much needed boost in the arm to Canadian businesses in the hospitality sector.   Paywall,  excerpts from article  &gt;... the next item on the agenda is the border.   &gt;   &gt;When can it reopen? To whom? And under what conditions?   &gt;   &gt;When the pandemic hit in March, 2020, the sort-of closing of the U.S.-Canada border was one of the jolts that registered the severity of the crisis. It was announced as an agreement to “temporarily restrict all non-essential travel.” While the two countries have started talking about how to ease the vise, the closure will last until at least June 21.   &gt;   &gt;Canada’s borders have been an endless source of pandemic consternation. The rules against non-essential travel eviscerated the tourism sector, yet for 14 months large numbers of people have continued to arrive from  the United States and elsewhere, many exploiting the multitude of  loopholes in the Liberal government’s hotel quarantine rules, themselves  only brought in half-heartedly, in response to public pressure.   &gt;   &gt;At the same time, Ottawa has insisted on imposing quarantine on fully  vaccinated travellers, and on Thursday said it would do the same with  Canadians who, for the sake of getting vaccinated, step even one metre across the U.S. border.   &gt;   &gt;...   &gt;   &gt;On Wednesday, the European Union laid out its framework. The 27 EU states will reopen their borders as soon as next week to  visitors from countries with very low virus counts, and other travellers  who are fully vaccinated. The fully vaccinated will not have to    quarantine.   &gt;   &gt;Individual European states may impose tighter restrictions, and the EU  further stands ready to pull an emergency brake on travel from any place  with a sudden outbreak. Europe is also working to create a “digital green certificate” – a vaccine passport.   &gt;   &gt;...   &gt;   &gt;Canadian and American officials have started talks to figure out what the arrangements should be for screening people who cross the world’s longest international border.   &gt;   &gt;A key question is whether the fully vaccinated should be allowed to  bypass quarantine obligations. Knowledge of the virus is evolving but,  from what is known so far, allowing the fully vaccinated to travel,  without the need to spend two weeks in isolation, makes sense.   &gt;   &gt;...   &gt;   &gt;Some worry that vaccine passports, or any requirement to prove  vaccination in order to travel, is an invasion of privacy. The debate  often blurs the line between requiring them domestically – such as to  attend a concert – versus at a border.   &gt;   &gt;...   &gt;   &gt;In the long run, proof of vaccination for travellers will hopefully  become unnecessary, thanks to the pandemic being stamped out. But that’s  a question for 2022 and beyond. As a bridge between now and then, and  to allow travel to safely restart, Canada needs to be able to verify the  vaccination status of anyone crossing the border.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/nhq5l5/globe_editorial_what_canada_and_canadians_need_to/gyxl4o9/

4059,1,1621251997,"&gt;Douglas Coupland is an artist and author whose books include Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture.   &gt;   &gt;I love vaccines. Throw them at me. Five weeks ago I got AstraZeneca and was feeling pretty stoked about it. Then I began to notice that when I told people I got AstraZeneca, their faces morphed into masks of pity. I consistently got the impression that people – mRNA people, mostly – view AstraZeneca as something ladled out of Donald Trump’s jacuzzi that was then shipped to India in a Ziploc bag stored beneath someone’s armpit, and once in India left to mellow at just over room temperature for three weeks before being sent to Canada and dumped into your arm.   &gt;   &gt;Conversations went something like this:   &gt;   &gt;“I’m sure you’ll be fine.”   &gt;   &gt;“Well of course, I’ll be fine. Right now I’m at 80 per cent immunity. Remember, this is the vaccine that saved England. They had no deaths this week. None.”   &gt;   &gt;“If it makes you feel better to think that, then that’s okay.”   &gt;   &gt;Usually it’s older people who give me this response, older people who got to choose which vaccine they got. People my age and younger got the leftovers – which is fine. AstraZeneca is a terrific vaccine, people! But people my age are used to leftovers. It’s the curse of being Gen X, and it’s not very often I ever discuss Gen X qua Gen X, but I think it’s called for here. For a generation that has grown up knowing their pensions will magically vanish the moment they retire, vaccine leftovers were yet more evidence that the statistical books never seem to balance in their favour and probably never will. When some provinces began turning off the AZ tap this week, I don’t think there was even one remotely surprised 50-year-old in the country.   &gt;   &gt;As far as I can tell, the government is now telling us that people given AstraZeneca for their first dose might have to choose an alternate vaccine as their booster shot. This idea was floated, as far as I could tell, with no science to back up the idea. The only validation out there is a single study from England, the results of which came out this week and reveals people who mix vaccines experience more unpleasant side effects – though the question of what kind of immunity mixing confers won’t be known for several weeks.   &gt;   &gt;So, do I mind getting a different vaccine as a booster? Not necessarily. Am I pissed off? Yes. I’m pissed off because I’m imagining a room full of politicians, not scientists, somewhere in Ottawa, having a meeting to try and gloss over this latest vaccine fiasco. I’m imagining someone’s personal assistant putting up their arm and suggesting, “Maybe we can turn this into a plus. Maybe if we allow people to choose their second shot, they’ll perceive it as a fun and empowering bonus. An opportunity even!” And then all the heads in the room nod and say, “You know, I think you’re onto something.”   &gt;   &gt;The fact that the announcement of AZ’s removal from the medical landscape was driven by politics and ineptitude rather than science bugged me so much that I wrote my first ever comment on The Globe and Mail’s website (which counts as some sort of milestone in my life). It said: What? Vaccines are now suddenly magically à la carte? This whole thing is starting to feel like it’s being run by Grade 11 students doing a science project.   &gt;   &gt;Comments sections being what they are I received several patronizing replies from readers saying that vaccines are safe and effective and that there’s nothing to worry about. This little smugfest failed to address the actual issue, that of politicians making up pretend science to cover their butts. Immunology is not a smorgasbord. How dare you make us subsidize your cluelessness with our bodies. Millions of people were promised a free trip to New Zealand and got shipped to AstraZenecaland instead. Will mixing an mRNA vaccine with AZ backfire in some hideous way? Maybe. Maybe not. Will I go with Pfizer? As any Gen Xer knows, there’s not much other choice. Ugh. Will an AZ plus an mRNA work on a vaccine passport? No one has said. On we go.   &gt;   &gt;The only remaining moral thing the government can do is scour the planet looking for two million doses to keep their promise to two million Canadians. AZ is out there somewhere – God knows people don’t want it – and we’re long past shame here, so grovel.

None of this is a personal attack on you, but me just going through the stuff my colleagues and I have thought about from a 'mental exercise' point of view because it's a fascinating problem. Like, for example:   a) That situation I mentioned in my previous post - 1 vaccine dose in Ontario, another in the US. How does that reconcile on the passport, with both effectively being marked '1 of 2' for the same vaccine? Would you be required to explain _why_ that situation occurred?  b) Marking it on passports: Works for Canadian citizens, but what about Permanent Residents or people who were here when they got vaccinated? The same quandary would apply as a non-American were I to get my shot in the US as well? Should we expect various nationalities to go to their independent consulates/embassies to get stamped? I doubt it; this would simply overwhelm the system and cause more logjams. The organization responsible for working on making new Canadian Passports can barely handle the backlog as it now stands. This document would _need_ to be an independent piece of paper that you carried with your passport, much like the yellow/red cards for Yellow Fever, etc.  c) The vaccine rollout, in the interest of expediency, allowed pharmacies to administer the first dose of AZ. How would a validation of that work to put it on a passport, in terms of a pharmacy verifying that they did in fact give both shots? How would that hold up in the face of foreign travel?   d) The broader question of all of this is - do other countries, with their varied methods of vaccine rollout and decision-making, have the capacity to recognize and trust the authority of other countries' health organizations? Will, for example, the CDC recognize the authority of Ontario's Trillium Health Partners as being at par, for example, with someone who had their vaccinations done in India? If not, then how is that standard set?   These are just some of the issues I see with this thorny problem of Proof of Vaccinations being used for international travel.   The more I look at it, the more I come to realize that getting a global standard to work with these situations might be near impossible, given that each country had to act quickly to the evolving situation within their borders. There will necessarily need to be some 'laxity' in the initial rollout to accommodate these situations. Additionally, it might be more of a non-problem considering every country is hoping that they have a vast majority of their local population immunized fully before they 'open the gates', as it were; nullifying the effect that a few 'bad faith actors' (i.e. people with falsified papers, for example) could have in terms of triggering another COVID wave on their soil.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/ndp7sv/vaccinations_are_picking_up_is_it_time_to_reopen/gyckzz4/

4076,0,1620943168,"&gt; WASHINGTON—This week, I told U.S. Rep. Brian Higgins that when it comes to the state of discussions about reopening the Canada-U. S. border, officials at the negotiating table are being very quiet.  &gt; “I think you’re being generous. I don’t think there is a table. I don’t think anybody’s at it. Therein lies the problem.”  &gt; So yeah, if you were thinking about a vacation in the U.S. this summer — or of having relatives who live down south come visit you — maybe come up with a Plan B.  &gt; Higgins, the co-chair of the U.S. Congressional Northern Border Caucus, represents Western New York, where frequent cross-border travel is both a way of life and a linchpin of the economy. When I spoke to him earlier this year, he was advocating a plan to possibly loosen restrictions on border travel by Canada Day or July 4, or at least to have some guidelines in place about when, how and under what circumstances reopening might take place. This week, tens of millions of vaccinations later, he was suggesting September as a new possible date to shoot for. Even on that, he didn’t sound particularly optimistic.  &gt; “A public health crisis can be managed and at the same time, you can begin to lift some restrictions,” Higgins said of his position that the definition of “essential travellers” should be expanded, possibly with some sort of vaccine requirement. “If you wait for this to be eradicated, the border’s never gonna open again.”  &gt; The border has been closed to most travellers since March of 2020. Since then, there have been almost monthly stories full of expert speculation about how and when a phased-in reopening plan might come. All along, these have been accompanied by no official word other than a monthly announcement that the current restrictions have been extended another month. Expect another extension announcement next week. And then probably another one a month after that.  &gt; A drop in the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and the wide availability of vaccines fuelled hopes things would be different this summer. For so many it can’t happen soon enough. Fully vaccinated Canadians living in the U.S. haven’t seen their families for over a year because they don’t have enough vacation time to build in a two-week quarantine in Canada. Higgins’ New York constituents who own cottages in Fort Erie, Ont. Border resort destinations like Old Orchard Beach, Maine where 60 per cent of a typical year’s tourist business comes from Canadians, or “Sunset Country” in northwestern Ontario where 95 per cent of fishing lodge rentals are to Americans.  &gt; The border isn’t entirely shut down, even for travel not considered essential. Under the current rules, Canadians can visit the U.S. as long as they quarantine when they return, and it is possible under some circumstances for visiting Canadian citizens to quarantine in the same house as those they plan to visit. It remains much harder for Americans to visit Canada for any non-essential reason, even if they own property there.  &gt; In any event, the numbers show the current restrictions have had a dramatic effect on the number of people crossing the border: A Statistics Canada report released Tuesday morning on international travel to Canada last month showed arrivals to Canada from the U.S. by both land and air were up significantly from April 2020, but were still down more than 90 per cent by land and 96.5 per cent by air when compared to April 2019.  &gt; And there have been some signs that a change may be on the horizon, though there is little momentum at the moment.  &gt; On his second day in office in January, President Joe Biden issued an executive order demanding his cabinet report on the issue of COVID-19 public health measures at the border within two weeks. Almost four months later, there’s been no public indication that report was written.  &gt; Last week, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote to Biden’s cabinet urging them to work with Canada to “finally develop a transparent, bilateral, and public plan” to safely reopen the border to non-essential travel — urgently, he wrote, before another “summer season” is lost. He’s among the most powerful members of the legislative branch of government, and is a Democrat, like Biden and Higgins.  &gt; Meanwhile, earlier this month Canada’s Health Minister Patty Hajdu said some form of vaccine passport would be a requirement for entry upon reopening Canada to visitors, a sign changes to travel policy are at least under consideration.  &gt; Tuesday, Omar Alghabra, Canada’s transport minister, said he’d discussed principles “for reopening the travel sector” with his G7 counterparts recently as part of a “comprehensive, ongoing effort,” but without a resolution in sight. “I can’t give you a time when we’re going to start seeing the gradual reopening, because it’s going to continue to be guided by public health measures and public health advice and public health experts.”  &gt; On the other hand, Premier Doug Ford has publicly suggested in recent weeks that restrictions at the U.S. border should be made stricter, not relaxed. And the U.S. Centers for Disease Control is still listing Canada as a destination Americans should avoid all travel to as a “Level 4” very high-risk country for COVID.  &gt; Officials close to the discussions on the border have been unwilling to speak on the record. Experts reading the tea leaves recently have been projecting no likely change until late summer or fall. The conversations I have had with those familiar with the process in both countries indicate nothing is likely to happen in the next few months.  &gt; To some, that sounds prudent. Others will find it a hard to swallow. Higgins, the U.S. representative, says he’ll keep arguing to at least develop a framework and criteria for decision-making on the question.  &gt; “Just a glimmer of recognition, a glimmer of hope. To say, here are the metrics that we want to reach, and if we reach them, we can get closer to a border opening,” Higgins says. “Nobody is arguing for opening the border arbitrarily or comprehensively. Just, you know, some semblance of vision, albeit limited vision, for return to normalcy.”",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/nbrn83/thinking_of_summer_travel_to_the_us_better_have_a/gy13w76/

4092,13,1620764020,"&gt; I've been hearing for a long time that the inoculated can still spread COVID  It isn't that the innoculated can still spread covid, it's that we didn't have data that they didn't still spread it.   The vaccine creators, in order to get the vaccines out the door quickly, tested whether the vaccine was safe and whether it prevented infection and severe outcomes. They did not test whether it prevented asymptomatic vaccinated individuals from spreading it.  So it isn't so much that the vaccines don't prevent people from spreading it as there was no data to suggest they don't (or data that they do). Good scientists are very careful about precisely stating what the data and studies tell us, and very careful about what they do not.  Right wing media and anti-vaxxers seized upon the ""we have no data on this"" and interpreted it to mean ""vaccines do not prevent spread.""  Which is not correct.  The emerging data (results of vaccination are still being studied) in places like the UK and Israel seem to suggest that the vaccines do prevent the spread of COVID.  &gt; it would also mean the immediate end of lockdown for those who receive it  Except that it takes 2 doses (for most vaccines) spaced at least 3 weeks apart and then an additional 2 weeks after the second dose to maximize the immunity provided by the vaccine. So immediate is relative.  I am not disagreeing with this point, but it opens up a whole other can of worms regarding proof of vaccination. Many countries are moving to various ""vaccine passport"" systems that would be required before boarding airplanes or transportation, or even possibly before entering sporting events, concerts, and other events.  The question then becomes who enforces the vaccine passports. Do we expect restaurant workers to request and enforce that all patrons have been vaccinated? retail workers? or do we wait until vaccination rates are close to a point that provides society with ""herd immunity"" before opening things up?",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/n9woue/vaccines_will_get_us_back_to_normal_why_is_canada/gxrrxon/

As to OP above, yes, this likely would prima facie violate s. 7 of the Charter, but provided there are proper limitations about the application of this law it could be saved by S. 7. Limitations like: (i) the law only stays in effect until such time as herd immunity is reached (maybe as determined by a political independent body?); (ii) medical exemptions.   The SCC has previously said that s. 7 violations will rarely be saved by s. 1 but - interestingly - one of the few times they said it would was during (as an example) an ""epidemic"" (Re: [BC Motor Vehicle Act at para 85](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1985/1985canlii81/1985canlii81.html?autocompleteStr=re%20bc%20moto&amp;autocompletePos=1)):   &gt;Administrative expediency, absolute liability's main supportive argument, will undoubtedly under s. 1 be invoked and occasionally succeed. Indeed, administrative expediency certainly has its place in administrative law. But when administrative law chooses to call in aid imprisonment through penal law, indeed sometimes criminal law and the added stigma attached to a conviction, exceptional, in my view, will be the case where the liberty or even the security of the person guaranteed under s. 7 should be sacrificed to administrative expediency. **Section 1 may, for reasons of administrative expediency, successfully come to the rescue of an otherwise violation of s. 7, but only in cases arising out of exceptional conditions, such as natural disasters, the outbreak of war, epidemics, and the like.**",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/mgdfvc/canada_must_make_covid19_vaccinations_mandatory/gsstc4n/

It's also a valid concern if you ask what happens to the ""passport"" for those who are just waiting to get a vaccine, but since the young and healthy will get vaccined last, they'll have to suffer the ""confinement"" longer than the older people just because their turn comes last?   I mean, all the young people sacrificed a year of their life to help save older people and this passport could potentialy let those older people enjoy life freely while the rest still wait?

The simple fact is that even if we devised a ""vaccine passport"" the whole thing would have to be temporary. Once we achieve herd immunity, it would be absurd to continue to have to prove vaccination to participate in normal activities. Why waste piles of money on a temporary program after we've already dug ourselves into a massive hole. International travel will be more tricky, but I think that would have to be temporary as well.
