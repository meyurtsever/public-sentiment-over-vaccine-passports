Definitely have that and some really good ffp2 masks. Look up which are best in fitting and protection as well as being comfortable for wearing the whole day. Personally I really recommend the Air Queen masks. They sit really well, are especially nice for people with glasses, they don‚Äôt smell weirdly and have a little plastic thing to keep the ribbon behind the head without having to wear it around the ears. Maybe they‚Äôre available in England too? I‚Äôd also recommend, depending on what transport you‚Äôre planning to use, to switch to a fresh mask after a few hours of being exposed to a lot of people.   Definitely read up on the entry rules. Prepare for some extra time in case they‚Äôre still doing testing on entry at the airport. They did it in December and even though I arrived at 11pm it was pretty full. They‚Äôre very well organised so it was within 40 minutes. But as I said, it was very late already and it might take longer depending on when you arrive :) have proof of vaccination directly with you a long with your passport/ID so they know it really is you who got the vaccine.  As a lot of people said: take disinfectant with you. Liquid one for proper hand cleaning and maybe one or two packages of disinfectant tissues for times when there‚Äôs no possibility to wash your hands or if you want to clean arm rests or something similar.   Also always very important: don‚Äôt touch the front part of your mask or your face in general when not immediately washing hands/disinfecting after! :)",Norway,t5_2qwrb,/r/Norway/comments/sifd3r/im_a_norwegian_citizen_who_moved_over_to_england/hv9pxbr/
1,0,1643651841,"Your chances of seeing the aurora are greater further north, in the cold and dark season, and in an area without too much light pollution. You can download an aurora tracker on your phone, it will give you some idea. Troms√∏ is a good starting point (and it has a nice planetarium!), but you might want to go outside of town to avoid light pollution. I saw the aurora from the deck of ""Hurtigruten"" about one day south from Troms√∏.  Some words of warning: In summer, the midnight sun will be up - no night means no aurora. Also, not every day has auroras, and if it's cloudy, you can't see it from the ground anyways. This means it's very difficult to plan. You need to be at the right place at the right time - a fair bit of luck.  Visiting the fjords: Yes, the fjords are open. Your idea of using Bergen as a starting point is sound, from there you can take a train to Voss (mountain/snow - great for skiing and hiking), or take a bus/boat to the fjords up or down the coast. And Bergen is nice in itself. However, Norway often has very bad weather, especially in winter. We just had a hurricane, and there have been avalanche-warnings... Do ask the locals on what's safe, what to wear etc: Nature in Norway kills a handful of tourists every year - don't add to the statistics.  As for culture, Norwegians are not very sophisticated. Some are rude. Most speak English, some speak French. There are also a few Moroccan expats, I am sure it's possible to get in touch with some of them via Facebook in advance. Also, due to covid-19 expect to have your vaccine passport checked at the border, and that you might have to wear a mask indoors in most public places.  Hope this is of some help :)",Norway,t5_2qwrb,/r/Norway/comments/sh5538/visiting_norway_from_morocco/hv0rx53/

If you were to stay in Bergen you could take a morning train to Voss (1 hour one way), do some skiing, be back by night.  Its very hard to make recommendations based on your text, because you do not provide much of interest, are you interested in the best restaurants, bars, hiking trips, museums, spa, sports, music, etc.   I personally would recommend free diving and fishing, unless you easily get cold.  Give us a list of things that you either really enjoy to do or things that you always wanted to try. then it would be much easier to provide you with good recommendations. Also, an idea of the budget would be nice to know.  Last thing I would recommend is having the vaccines in order, I think it is only a matter of time before we get vaccine-passport, meaning establishments can opt. to deny you service if you can not show a valid documentation that you have taken the vaccines.",Norway,t5_2qwrb,/r/Norway/comments/r4h4ls/traveling/hmio6hh/
5,0,1636075103,"Hello everyone. If you are a non European citizen that is fully vaccinated, there is a way for you to get a Swiss vaccine certificate which is connected to the EU Covid Passport and subsequently is accepted by Norway.  &amp;#x200B;  [https://covidcertificate-form.admin.ch/foreign](https://covidcertificate-form.admin.ch/foreign)  &amp;#x200B;  Go to the above link. You need.  1) Passport  2) Your country's vaccine certificate equivalent.  3) Proof of travel to Switzerland. Including the address you'll be staying at. I am genuinely travelling to Switzerland so all I did was present a screenshot of a hotel booking. You just need to provide something like this whether you plan to travel to Switzerland or not.  4) To pay the 30CHF fee.  5) Wait for them to process it. For me it took 12 hours from submitting the application.  &amp;#x200B;  If you want to play around with the certificate once it is issued to you, you can download the French TousAntiCovid app and use that to scan the Swiss one you get.

It states:   ‚ÄòWe are working on solutions to expand this system to include people who have been vaccinated using vaccines approved in the UK, the USA, and by WHO.

8,0,1632725201,"&gt;Ok so you are for segregation then, because some people cant medically get it and would not be able to go to certain places  Why is this always the argument you people turn to?  In the event of people being medically unable to have the vaccine, they would be qualified for this magical, mystical thing called a 'medical exemption'. That would mean that, yes, they wouldn't qualify for a vaccine passport that said they were vaccinated. But what's to stop the healthcare system issuing a vaccine passport that says ""medically exempt"" on it? So, they haven't been vaccinated, because they can't be, but their rights must be unimpeded because it's not actually their fault, so they get the passport anyway. I'll tell you what's stopping them - absolutely bugger all, and that's likely going to be what they do.   The only thing you're likely to find at this point is people who are, for whatever reason, medically exempt from the vaccine *may* be barred from certain job positions, since they pose a potential health risk. But funnily enough, that's already the case. People with certain conditions can't become pilots or lorry drivers. People on certain medications can't operate heavy machinery. It *already* happens. It's nothing new.  It's a really fucking *simple* concept, you know.  If someone is actually medically exempt (declared such by a real doctor), then the system has to accommodate them. Besides, most European countries aren't doing the 'no vaccine pass, no entry' thing. They'll still let you into wherever you need the passport for if you provide a negative COVID test from within 48 hours. So even for people who are *wilfully* unvaccinated, there's no 'segregation'. It's just more complicated.  Stop oversimplifying the situation.",Norway,t5_2qwrb,/r/Norway/comments/pvpaxj/stavanger_five_hours_after_all_restrictions_were/heg1jvq/
