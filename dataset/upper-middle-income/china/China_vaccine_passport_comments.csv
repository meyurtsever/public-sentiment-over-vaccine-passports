6,0,1628222246,"Cultural Revolution 2.0 is coming. There is a Chinese slang circulating on the Internet: “闭关锁国，关门打狗” (close the country's doors and hit \[kill\] the dogs). Xi Jinping is really Mao Zedong 2.0.  So, the Chinese government is really trying to make sure they are isolated. If you are a Chinese citizen in China, you will likely be banned from leaving (passport issuance in 2020 is down an astonishing 98% from 2019, from 16.5 million to just 330 000). If you are a Chinese citizen overseas trying to return, they make you isolate for 21 days even if fully vaccinated by a western vaccine (2 shots for Pfizer **or** Moderna **or** AstraZeneca **or** 1 shot for Johnson and Johnson) + 14 days. This makes a vacation to visit family impossible without extensive paid time off or outright termination from your job in the other country even if you are exempt from quarantine upon return to that other country. If you are a naturalized citizen in that country, you are prohibited from entering China because China has a one-citizenship policy (except for Hong Kong and Macau residents).  On the other hand, they are now promoting such extreme policies to make their citizens less connected to the international community (which severely hurts their economy because it makes any kind of international transaction much, much more difficult). They are wasting valuable time where the children can learn one of the most widely used languages on Earth, and indoctrinating them with extreme cult-of-personality statements (just like they did in Mao Zedong's time). According to my mother, in school, they kept having to praise Mao (whereas I did not have to keep praising Hu Jintao when I was in school and he was president). Within generations, China will regress into the way it was 60 years ago, which is exactly what it doesn't need, because it is already facing imminent collapse due to population decline pressures.  No wonder, the Hong Kongers saw this coming to them. In 2020, according to the Education Bureau, a whopping 15400 students dropped out of school in Hong Kong (out of 705000 students), which is to say that more than 2% of students who attended school in 2019 are no longer doing so. Why are students dropping out? Of course, their parents are taking the kids out of school, quitting their jobs, selling their homes and cars, and using the money to buy a one way ticket to Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States to start their new lives. This is before the British government started allowing British National (Overseas) passport holders to resettle in the United Kingdom. This number will be even more horrifying in 2021 when the data comes out in August 2022.  Honestly, I feel very scared for my nieces and nephew (the children of my first cousins) in China. Their country is doing things that will transform them into crazy people and I think that with this kind of indoctrination, they may grow up and come to view us (my mother, my sister and her son) as ""enemies"" to be hated just because we live in Canada. The other thing: the fact that my sister's son (a native-born Canadian) speaks Cantonese better than my cousins' children pisses me to no end. Any culture that is not ""Beijing"" culture, or ""Xi Jinping culture"" is to be invalidated and suppressed--even culture native to the different regions of China.",China,t5_2qh2v,/r/China/comments/oywbbn/shanghai_requires_all_primary_and_secondary/h7w9jzi/

The shitshow in India got me scared, I am not dull enough to think that the same cant happen in China. Now the shitshow in Taiwan is happening. Trying to book my second dose. I believe China is primed for a SS as well. 3. I believe in the whole vaccine passport thing will become a reality. In the way that vaccinated folks will get societal QOL improvements. I dont know exactly what those are when they will happen but I know that at one point, they are going to give incentives to those who are vaccinated. In the US, this QOL improvement is the ability to forego your mask.

Similar to what hapigood said, it was an easy process, the line to get it wasn't even that long or slow. In my case, I requested the vaccine through my school, who simply called the nearest vaccination point and told them we would show up, and that was it. Went there with my passport and nothing else, got the shot after 30 minutes or so, waited for another 30 minutes in a room, and then left. Most Chinese people I know have also gotten their first shot at least, usually through work (Jiangsu) or direct sign-up (Shanghai).

14,1,1620480481,There is no word from my uni about foreigners being able to return. It depends whether they can get enough of the population vaccinated before the summer. I believe they want 40% of the population vaccinated by July and maybe they will open the borders then. But word has it that they are struggling to meet that target. They will also have to officially recognise the foreign vaccines too in their system. Because they are already introducing their own vaccine passport system.
