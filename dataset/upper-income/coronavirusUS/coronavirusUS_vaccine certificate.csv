1,0,1638142096,"My little kids just got their second vaccine and husband and I are boosted.  I have hosted vaccinated family members (who I haven't seen in 2 years) for Thanksgiving (plus one 4 year old) after we and they all got negative rapid tests. For Christmas I'm traveling to see vaccinated family members because I haven't been able to in so long. Honestly I feel like we should squeeze it in now while our immunity is high and before things potentially get bad with omicron. I've lost a lot of time with loved ones over the past two years and it feels worth the risk to see them now that I've taken every precaution that I can.   Otherwise we will continue to mask in public and not hang out with unvaxxed people or go to crowded indoor events. Unless there is really bad omicron news, I will begin hosting select vaccinated friends in my house and I'm going to finally cash in the spa gift certificate I got for my birthday during the summer. I still haven't decided if I'm ready to eat in restaurants full of people yet. (I ate in a pizza parlor today but it was at 2pm and we were the only people there.)",CoronavirusUS,t5_2f86o2,/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/r4ewq7/what_are_your_current_christmasnew_yearsholiday/hmgoc8r/
2,0,1637647852,OP are you American? I assume you are from saying “back” - but if not note the US definition of fully vaccinated is different from the EU… the EU counts one dose of a two dose vaccine plus COVID recovery as fully vaccinated but the US you need both doses.  You don’t say where you are going but only NY/LA/SF are the biggest cities requiring vaccinations to enter restaurants etc and the EU digital certificate would be fine. I am not sure how you would actually get a US card for your vaccines as they won’t have a US record.,CoronavirusUS,t5_2f86o2,/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/qy3aqv/ill_be_moving_back_to_the_us_soon_do_i_need_an/hlqln8z/
3,0,1628711226,"I lived in an area with strict alcohol and tobaccoo enforcement in the North East. It didn't stop shops selling me cigarettes, beer and the like. Once you are a ""regular"" most where happy to sell as long as you told them it was for a parent that smokes / drinks. I was the twelve year old buying cigarettes because my mom didn't want to walk to the shop...   Even with strict enforcement they lack the power to validate the vaccine passports. The point of the passports is to inconvenience people enough to roll up a sleeve. Strict enforcement won't work when any one can print out a legit certificate and fill it out. The states that need vaccine passports are the states that won't implement them. Everywhere else they are just a prod to get on with it.",CoronavirusUS,t5_2f86o2,/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/p22tci/when_will_it_mostly_end/h8kmwrk/

5,0,1621439909,"Yes. And it's not just the maga dummies and people with comorbidities. I found that one of my health care providers and staff had not been vaccinated. The way I found out was I handed in a copy of my vaccination certificate and nobody recognized it. They said they couldn't accept it because the dosage wasn't stated and it wasn't on the provider's official stationery.  There were obviously Moderna stickers on it, but maybe they didn't recognize the name. Apparently the other patients haven't handed theirs (if they have one)in either. My doctor there is an MD but also a Trump supporter. I researched private medical practices and and found that many alternative health care providers (chiropractors, etc), and naturally many Republicans in private practice don't believe in getting vaccinated. I just assumed my doctor and staff had been vaccinated--don't make the same assumptions--call ahead and see what the vaccine/mask policy is.
