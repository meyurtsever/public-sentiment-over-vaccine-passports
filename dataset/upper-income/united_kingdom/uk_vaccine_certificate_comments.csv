The state I am in (BDW) has dropped the requirement, however for a time, if I wanted to go  somewhere (that wasn't a shop) I had to present either a negative test (from within 24 hrs), or proof of full vaccination (10 days since second vaccination) or show proof of COVID within the last 6 months. The workers who didn't meet those requirements were regularly tested and had to wear masks.  These rules applied regardless of whether you were sat inside or outside a resturant for example and obviously applied inside museums, entertainment venues, gyms, etc. When cases got low enough, the rules were changed to only apply if you sat inside a resturant and a couple of weeks ago the rules were dropped entirely. From what I understand, businesses can still choose to enforce these rules (for example my local climbing gym says you still must either be tested or fully vaccinated), but most aren't. That said, when I go into a resturant or whatever (even if outside) I still have to register my presence on an app called 'luca'.      I personally took the decision to just wait it out, as I didn't want to get tested just to eat somewhere or visit someplace. I don't desperately need to do anything.

8,0,1625725182,"&gt;The Scottish government has days to act to relieve “very high pressure” on healthcare, according to the chair of BMA Scotland, after a second health board flagged acute workforce pressures as a result of rising Covid cases and large numbers of staff having to self-isolate.  &gt;Lewis Morrison said the decision by Raigmore hospital – the biggest in the Highlands – to cancel all non-urgent surgery and outpatient activity after it reached capacity on Tuesday was “a weather vane rather than an isolated example”.  &gt;Morrison told BBC Radio Scotland: “Raigmore is an example of what might well happen in other places if we don’t take some action to deal with what is a very high level of pressure on healthcare, both in general practice and in hospitals, combined with rising Covid cases leading to a large number of staff having to self-isolate.”  &gt;Asked if Scotland should follow England in scrapping self-isolation for those who have been double-vaccinated, he said he would rather make the case specifically about healthcare staff: “Do we have the evidence to support fully vaccinated staff who are contacts continuing to work with some sort of change to the testing regime?”  &gt;While warning that any changes must be evidence-based, he said the situation was urgent. He said: “Within the next few days a decision needs to be made to ensure the continuity of healthcare services in areas under these kinds of pressure.”  &gt;On Wednesday morning, Scottish Labour called on ministers to intervene as it was revealed that NHS Lanarkshire was considering scaling back its elective care services and had asked the public to attend emergency departments only “as a last resort”.  &gt;In a message to NHS Lanarkshire staff, the chief executive, Heather Knox, said: “The challenges caused by pressures on our emergency departments, rising Covid numbers and workforce pressures, are causing difficulties for staff across both acute and community services.”  &gt;Data released by the World Health Organization at the weekend revealed that half of the top 10 areas in Europe with the highest rates of Covid-19 were in Scotland.  &gt;The latest figures from the National Records of Scotland, published on Wednesday, showed that last week there were 21 deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, an increase from 17 last week.  &gt;Earlier on Wednesday, the education secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, said the Scottish government “is looking very seriously” at whether to follow England on changes to self-isolation advice for children ahead of schools returning in August.  &gt;Later on Wednesday, first minister Nicola Sturgeon told the BBC that the planned easing of Scottish restrictions on 19 July and 9 August were “not set in stone” and that it was important to chart the route out of lockdown “at a sensible pace”.  &gt;“Nothing, against a global pandemic of an infectious virus that has got more infectious and transmissible with the Delta variant, can be set in stone.  &gt;“But to set dates in stone while we still face that virus would not in my view be responsible. My job is to take hard decisions that get us as safely as possible to that end point.”  &gt;The delayed move to level zero planned for 19 July will mean the general indoor physical distancing requirement should be reduced from 2 metres to 1 metre, and the outdoor requirement to physically distance should be lifted altogether.  &gt;From 9 August, the Scottish government aims to remove remaining legal restrictions, including social distancing indoors, by which time all over-40s should have had their second vaccine for at least two weeks.  &gt;Data last week showed that the 80% of new cases were among the under-44s, with with a total of almost 2,000 football-related cases emerging from test and protect data last Wednesday.

He was speaking after Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said he had been in talks with Singapore and the US already about how to unlock the possibility of holidays.  “We’re looking at all sorts of things that we may wish to do in the months ahead,” Johnson said. “You’d expect us to be talking to travel firms about all kinds of options, but the top priority now is to drive forward that vaccination programme, to give . . . everybody in the country the protection they need.”  He added: “But when we’re in that different world, which I hope is as soon as possible, then all kinds of apps and all kinds of possibilities will be open.”  Shapps had earlier acknowledged that an international vaccine passport scheme was a likely reality of post-Covid travel. “Just as we have things like the yellow fever card ... I imagine that in the future there will be an international system where countries will want to know that you have been potentially vaccinated or potentially had tests taken before flying, before you come in,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

Priti Patel, the home secretary, referenced the WHO’s work yesterday when she confirmed that the UK was working with international partners on vaccine certificates. “The World Health Organisation . . . have already done a call to action to work internationally to work in the multilateral community around how they can start to look at this,” she told The Times.  “That’s an important piece of work — there’ll be other multilateral organisations working with national governments so that work is a much higher level.”",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/lhfyt0/boris_johnson_sees_covid_vaccine_passport_app_as/gmx12a2/

33,0,1612347964,"Michael Gove will demand today that Brussels take urgent action to relax post-Brexit trade rules between Britain and Northern Ireland because the situation is endangering the peace process.  The Cabinet Office minister is expected to tell Maros Sefcovic, his EU counterpart, that the rules do not work and that unionists oppose them.  Tension has risen in the province after the European Commission threatened last Friday to renege on elements of the withdrawal agreement. Its officials, who wanted to prevent [coronavirus vaccines](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-flow-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-from-eu-now-guaranteed-says-minister-mwptpvxhc) from being exported to the UK, backed down after an outcry.  Yesterday checks on goods arriving in Northern Irish ports from mainland Britain were suspended over [fears for the safety of port staff](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/northern-ireland-halts-post-brexit-port-checks-after-sinister-behaviour-6qv3rdzxx). Police reported an “upsurge in sinister and menacing behaviour” by loyalists. Border officials were threatened in graffiti near Larne and claimed that unknown individuals were noting down their number plates.  Gove is expected to warn Sefcovic that the vaccine row has “shifted the political dynamic” and that changes to the Northern Ireland protocol, which was designed to avoid a hard border between the province and the Republic, are needed rapidly. In particular the government wants some checks and restrictions on the export of food and agricultural goods to be permanently lifted.  Gove said that the “grace periods” afforded to traders moving goods between Britain and Northern Ireland must be extended. Speaking in the Commons, he told MPs that an extended leniency period on EU customs rules was required to ensure supermarkets and traders could continue to supply “consumers with the goods they need”.  The government is also seeking the abolition of rules that require pets crossing the Irish Sea to have a £100 animal health certificate. Gove has not ruled out invoking Article 16 of the protocol, which would allow the government to suspend elements of it if they are causing serious “economic, societal or environmental difficulties”. The EU intended to invoke the clause to prevent vaccine supplies reaching Britain via Northern Ireland.  Gove said that the vaccine row had led to broader questions about the protocol that could not be dismissed as “teething problems”. He added: “Trust has been eroded, damage has been done and urgent action is therefore needed.  “Peace, progress and strong community relations in Northern Ireland have been hard-won and in recent days we’ve seen an increase in community tension, and, as was reported last night, port staff in Belfast and Larne have been kept away from work following concerns for their safety. The EU needs to work with us at speed and with determination to resolve a series of outstanding issues with the protocol.”  However Simon Coveney, Ireland’s foreign minister, said that issues over the protocol would not be solved by cutting relationships. “I recognise that there are serious issues that need to be resolved, we need to work on that with the commission today and with leaders in Northern Ireland,” he told *Today* on Radio 4. “But this isn’t going to be solved by cutting off relationships or trying to throw away the entire protocol, without any credible proposals as to what you replace it with.”  He added: “The protocol is only a month old. It’s part of an international agreement between the UK and the EU. We all have legal obligations in terms of its implementation and so the focus now needs to be on a calm, but firm, discussion around how we make the protocol more acceptable in the context of its implementation, where there are real problems.”  Whitehall sources said that the vaccine dispute had undermined the faith of businesses, and given influence to unionist hardliners. Arlene Foster, the Northern Ireland first minister, who will take part in the meeting with Sefcovic, is under particular pressure.  A poll this week suggested that support for her Democratic Unionist Party had fallen to 19 per cent as hardline unionists defect to the Traditional Unionist Voice party.  Ministers in the power-sharing executive issued a joint statement condemning the threats. Foster described the actions against the port staff as utterly reprehensible but called for changes to the protocol, telling UTV: “The way to deal with this is through constitutional politics.”  Micheál Martin, the Irish prime minister, told RTE that he condemned the “intimidatory tactics”. He added: “It’s a very sinister and ugly development.”",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/lbkpjm/crisis_talks_with_eu_after_loyalist_threats_at/glui3ic/

It comes amid ""weird"" data showing that case rates have been lower in unvaccinated individuals than the single, double, or even triple-jabbed since Omicron became the dominant variant in Scotland.  The counterintuitive data from Public Health Scotland (PHS) contradicts previous pandemic trends which have consistently shown infection, hospitalisation and death rates to be highest among the unvaccinated.  However, one expert stressed that the patterns probably reflect factors such as Omicron initially transmitting in more affluent communities.  ""It does appear weird until you start breaking things down,"" said Professor Rowland Kao, chair of veterinary epidemiology and data science at Edinburgh University.  HeraldScotland: Infection rates have been lowest since December 18 among the unvaccinated group, in a reverse of patterns seen previously in the pandemic Infection rates have been lowest since December 18 among the unvaccinated group, in a reverse of patterns seen previously in the pandemic  According to the latest PHS report, the Covid death rate has been consistently higher since December 4 in the double-jabbed compared to the unvaccinated - but much lower in the triple-jabbed.  The report defines a Covid death as ""an individual who has tested positive by PCR for SARS-CoV-2 [the coronavirus which causes Covid] at any time point and has Covid-19 listed as an underlying or contributory cause of death on the death certificate"".  In the final week of December, the death rate was 7.06 per 100,000 among the double-jabbed compared to 4.79 per 100,000 in the unvaccinated, and 0.21 per 100,000 in the triple-vaccinated.  READ MORE: Why Omicron is pushing the NHS to the brink - even if it is milder  In the week ending January 7, the hospitalisation rate was also twice as high in the double-jabbed compared to the unvaccinated - 130 admissions per 100,000 versus 59 per 100,000 - but fell to just 15 per 100,000 in the triple-jabbed.  The admissions data does not differentiate between patients in hospital 'because of' Covid and those who tested positive while being treated for other ailments, but PHS said the high hospitalisation rate for double-vaccinated individuals is being driven by increasing admissions among over-70s who are not yet boosted and whose immunity is waning.  It added: ""In other age groups the rates remain lower for those with two doses compared to those with one dose or unvaccinated.  ""This group of individuals aged 70-plus who have had two doses of vaccine but have not yet had a booster may include some very vulnerable individuals.""  HeraldScotland: The hospitalisation was twice as high in the double-jabbed compared to the unvaccinated, but PHS said this was skewed by admissions in over-70s and was not being seen in younger age groups  The hospitalisation was twice as high in the double-jabbed compared to the unvaccinated, but PHS said this was skewed by admissions in over-70s and was not being seen in younger age groups  The number of over-70s being admitted to hospital with Covid has surged from 131 in the week ending December 14 to 370 in the week ending January 4. While uptake has been strong, around 38,500 adults over 70 in Scotland are still due boosters.  The report also shows that during the three weeks to January 7, Covid case rates were consistently lowest in the unvaccinated population.  READ MORE: Six in 10 Covid patients admitted to hospital 'because of' virus  Preliminary data for last week - which is age-standardised to adjust for the fact that younger people are more likely than older adults to be unvaccinated - shows a Covid case rate of 11 per 1000 in the unvaccinated group compared to 15 per 1000 for those who had received a booster or third dose, and 25 per 1000 for the double-vaccinated cohort.  People are defined as being triple-jabbed if they test positive for Covid more than 14 days after their booster, ruling out explanations such as people contracting the virus in crowded queues at vaccine hubs in the run up to Christmas.  HeraldScotland: Covid hospital admissions have been rising steeply in the over-70s  Covid hospital admissions have been rising steeply in the over-70s  Prof Kao said Omicron was ""evening out the playing field"" in term of infections partly due to its ability break through vaccine protection, but also because had seeded through more affluent postcodes and arrived at a time when people previously protected by working-from-home were less likely to be doing so.  He said: ""If you look at the initial spread of Omicron the deprivation relationship was inverted.  ""You were actually more at risk of being exposed to Omicron if you lived in an area of lower deprivation, and if you're more affluent you are also more likely to have been double or triple vaccinated.  ""It's not just in Scotland; a friend of mine in Wales is seeing exactly the same thing and saying 'what in the world is going on?'.  ""My suspicion is that we have this initial explosion of infections which ignores all the previous rules, and that this question of 'where did it start off?' is more important that all the other risk factors.""  HeraldScotland: Since early December, the death rate has been higher in the double-vaccinated than the unvaccinated, but this again is likely to reflect waning immunity in hospitalised and vulnerable over-70s who were not yet boosted  Since early December, the death rate has been higher in the double-vaccinated than the unvaccinated, but this again is likely to reflect waning immunity in hospitalised and vulnerable over-70s who were not yet boosted  In addition, Prof Kao said it was unclear how well immunity from multiple prior Covid infections protected against Omicron.  He said: ""We know you get more protection from three hits of any sort - that could be two doses plus infection, two doses plus a booster.  ""But we don't actually know what would happen if you got infected two or three times, and there are probably people out there who have been.  ""You have these pockets of deprived areas in particular where the virus has been circulating at a much higher rate.""  READ MORE: Around 240,000 fewer operations carried out by NHS Scotland since pandemic began  A spokeswoman for PHS said the figures could also be skewed by factors such as higher testing uptake by ""more health conscious"" vaccinated people, adding that ""these biases become more evident as more people are vaccinated and the differences between the vaccinated and unvaccinated population become systematically different"".  HeraldScotland: HeraldScotland: Cases and hospital admissions both now look to be in decline in Scotland  Cases and hospital admissions both now look to be in decline in Scotland  She added that the higher case rates in the double-vaccinated are being driven by infections among over-40s whose immunity is waning, but who have not yet taken up or become eligible for boosters.  She added: ""The vaccination status of cases, inpatients and deaths should not be used to assess vaccine effectiveness because of differences in risk, behaviour and testing in the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.""",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/s3fvj1/what_is_going_on_covid_rates_lowest_in/hskm852/

I'm almost certain that if you get the vaccine and then covid symptoms, for it to be included on a death certificate there will need to either be a positive test, or in rare circumstances a doctor saying that in their medical opinion it is beyond resonable doubt covid. To my knowledge there hasn't been any reports of a vaccine causing the symptoms that usually lead to covid deaths such as significantly dropping oxygen levels or serious lung problems. I don't think there have been any reports from doctors saying they are having people come in with the life threatening covid symptoms who are testing negative and dying. I would imagine this would be widely reported because as you say this would mean that either the vaccine is causing ""covid deaths"" or the tests  arent working.

40,1,1639517471,"I can’t get further than a few paragraphs because of the paywall, so I’ll go off what you’ve written here.   I would like to state clearly that I do not trust this government. I absolutely believe they’re taking measures that are terrifying and authoritarian and they need reining in.   I will also say that I’m very aware of the adage “never let a good crisis go to waste”. I’m aware that measures brought into place as a temporary measure may well linger after the emergency is gone.   However, we are in the middle of pandemic. Now, I’m hoping that with omnicron we’re seeing a trend towards a much milder variant that will outcompete the other variants and render Covid more of a nuisance than anything else, but until we get there we need to take measures to mitigate against deaths.   Unfortunately, during a crisis like a pandemic, personal freedoms do get suppressed because when given the freedom to choose, many people choose to be arseholes. Look at the number of people on the tube not wearing masks even though it’s mandatory. Look at the number of people refusing to get a free vaccine but happy to take the drugs being offered to them one night and go look after the elderly the next.   You draw parallels with China. I’m looking more at America where people send thoughts and prayers every time children are killed in a school shooting but will fight tooth and nail against any gun regulation on the basis of their freedoms.   Between America and China there is a balance to be struck.   If we want to protect our elderly but do not want any form of vaccine checking then the alternative is a lockdown - or keeping the vulnerable and those in contact with them confined while the rest of us go about our daily lives. Some of us seemingly young and healthy people will die, but that’s just a risk we have to take good things going back to “normal”.   Or we can take some small measures to try and keep things under control. Make people wear face masks. Make people show their vaccination certificate when going into confined spaces.   One thing I will say - if you’re concerned about us becoming like China, look to the measures we’ve taken to strip people of their citizenship and right to protest. Look at the erosion of our social security and healthcare such that we cannot afford to be out of work so will be more reluctant to strike or do anything that might offend our employers.   A vaccine certificate is a very small thing in comparison, and one which has infinitely more benefits to society.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/rgeq8w/boris_johnson_suffers_large_tory_rebellion_as_mps/hok9rk4/

One of the big unspoken problems on my side of the debate is that most our scientists are elderly &amp; retired (those still in employ have a lot to lose) and speak with dry shaky voices and are rather boring. Dr Bill Gray (deceased) was great, but he was a struggle to listen to.   On your side you've got media outlets like CNN who are smart about optics; they don't put boring scientists on screen, they use fast-talking ""science educators"" who are television and radio presenters dressed in lab coats who look and sound the part.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  This is way, way off the original topic, but on the issue of Barack Obama's birthplace, I do NOT believe Sherriff Joe Arpaio's theory about the birth certificate; he made a couple of very stupid mistakes about how the certificates were stamped. But on other hand, still no one has ever seen Obama's original birth certificate; it's perfectly plausible that it was destroyed, but affluent families like the Obamas tend to keep items like that quite safe.   I don't think Tony Heller ever made much mention of the birth certificate. He did however publish this: [https://realclimatescience.com/2017/01/exposing-the-first-birther/](https://realclimatescience.com/2017/01/exposing-the-first-birther/)  According to Barrack Obama's literary agent, he was born in Kenya, raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.   Now that really did get me thinking ""huh???"". It's nothing conclusive, it's just really odd. Perhaps it was a PR thing and Barack Obama was happy at the time to falsely claim that he was born in Kenya to seem more cosmopolitan?   It would not matter to me personally at all if Barack Obama  was born in Kenya, but legally, Constitutionally, it is an issue.   Did gun control lead to the Jewish Holocaust? Dunno. Don't care.

49,0,1634697936,"So I'm a Brit living in Germany, who was in the UK last summer and just recently. I also visited Portugal, France, Spain and Greece in the last few months. It's just staggeringly obvious why - and it's a confluence of reasons.     1. **Arrogance** \- I travelled to the UK (after much prevarication) in early March of 2020. The virus was already in Italy and Germany closed down pretty much overnight over the space of a few days as I was leaving - the difference between outlooks in Germany and the UK was like night and day. An example: I'm in the pharmacy south-east England and women in the queue are bitching about how Italians are so dramatic and their country is so badly run, no wonder people are dying. I clapped back and told them to grow up and that I wouldn't be surprised if the UK had the worst death rate in Europe come summer. See also everyone pretending like nothing was happening. See also the whole cabinet falling ill in the space of a few days, etc, etc. See British tourists here in Berlin acting like it's the biggest imposition in the world to show a certificate to show that you're vaccinated and wear a mask when you're buying a few beers. It's like the manifestation of this warped Blitz mentality that certain Brits have been dreaming of, taking joy in sneering at these weak Europeans.    2. **Poor governance** \- so I mean the UK had all the advantages; an island nation, a superlative and trusted national health service, fifth richest nation on earth, trusted media (in terms of BBC and Channel 4), low rates of vaccine skepticism and crucially, a relatively latecomer to the corona party. But we still managed to fuck it up. Monumentally. Moving from 'mustn't grumble' to 'call this number if you see your neighbour even talk to someone else in their house', making policies, then going back on them, ad infinitum. It's not as if there weren't a shortage of good examples to follow re policy (hi deutschland, greece, finland)- but hey, this government couldn't admit that Europe could do anything right, so it was prepared to kill tens of thousands of citizens just to prove a point. This timeline, published in late 2020, demonstrates how COVID-19 policy diverged in Germany and the UK and the results of British Tory poor choices. It ends last year but I wish they would post a follow up. Link [here](https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertonardelli/coronavirus-timeline-uk-germany-comparison-johnson-merkel).    3. Ending all public health measures in the UK just like that - so here in Germany, since May, things have slowly reopened. Not everything went smoothly - as a country with a private healthcare system, Germany was a goddamn shambles as once they vaccinated everyone vulnerable, they opened it up to everyone at once (cue people calling around 40 plus GPs to get a shot and sick people unable to get an appointment). But since mid-May, test centres which offered free lateral flow tests (called schnelltests here - quicktests) opened on every street corner. You had to get tested to get into anything inside - bars, clubs, cinemas, art galleries, etc - if you weren't vaccinated. I've had about five a week since a May, so with my shit maths, I've probably had several hundred tests. This is still the case to this day, and it was only last week that the government here ended free tests for residents, although you can pay 15 euro a time to take one, in easily accessible testing centres.  (And also for all the ignoramuses on this thread saying the UK tests so much - **Germany and many other European countries don't count lateral flow tests in their stats** \- and jesus, the UK is upping its PCR test rates by forcing people like me to take them to enter the UK, even though the rate in my area of Germany was 60/100,000 compared to 400/100,00 when I entered.Masks are worn on public transport and inside shops - and medical FF2P ones, not the blue bits of nothing some folk wear in the UK. You have to show your vaccination certificate to enter clubs inside (or recovery from the virus or a test - though most clubs won't accept tests now). It's pretty much the same in Greece, Portugal, France, Spain with added hand sanitiser - it's just the UK that's an outlier)     4. **Something has gone deeply wrong with English culture (see also selfishness and lack of solidarity)** \- I was back in (London and the South east for ten days this month. I was fucking stunned. I visited last August and London was like a ghost town. The sense of fear of palpable. Not this summer - no one gives a fuck. My friends are a mixture of first generation immigrants and Brits from a variety of backgrounds. No one wore masks, everyone moaned about restrictions, no one seemed to have any clue that the rest of Europe required vaccinations to enter, or to wear masks in shops and public transport. Two guys who I know and love and are otherwise decent, lovely people, threw mini tantrums about 'What a nightmare Europe is for requiring you to wear a mask on public transport' (a guy who works in healthcare) and a member of my own family refused to take a test to enter a venue, after getting annoyed about being asked for a vaccination certificate. Why wouldn't you feel happy to take these small measures to protect other people?!      I genuinely am deeply worried about the state of my home country after my visit - the culture just seems so horribly warped, small-minded, and disregarding of the huge amounts of people who have suffered. I know people who can't work because of long covid and their mates just shrug it off. Something has gone really, really horribly wrong and it makes me so sad. I'm just genuinely horrified.     Thanks for coming to my Tedtalk, lols. I guess I had a lot to say but for anyone who is British and still reading this far, what's happening in the UK right now is just so so so far from normal.

53,0,1631460048,"It did say that if they were symptomatic but unvaccinated, that they'd still get the full sick pay, presumably to slightly reduce the risk of a successful legal challenge.  The issue I could see arising, is that for an employee to demonstrate that they cannot take the vaccine in order to recieve full sick pay if they are asymptomatic, they'd need a doctor to certify this. As with regular sick notes, doctors cannot divulge details of a patients' condition to their employer, but they may feel that this question is too much of an incursion on patient confidentiality, given how few contraindications there are for these vaccines, and more critically they may feel that it adversely affects patient autonomy because the flipside of providing certificates for some leaves others penalised for failure to consent to a medical procedure. There's also variation in degree to which a doctor might be willing to certify someone with a relevant phobia or allergy, given that these can be managed for the vaccine but severe instances still strain the patient. Even if the courts decide that it is ok for an employer to seek such a certificate, the medical profession may have ethical qualms.  It also seems unclear why Morrisons cannot just insist that unvaccinated employees wear suitable PPE at all times when at work, provide this to them, and deploy their usual disciplinary procedures surrounding breach of health and safety rules for those who neglect to wear them correctly. Tbh I feel their primary motive is to advertise to customers that their supermarkets will be safer than alternatives, but there will be many employers eager to use any decision in Morrison's favour to chip away at things. In this instance, the intensity of the anti-vaxx movement and all of the publicity the situation generates means that unvaccinated employees of Morissons are likely to be well supported in bringing a case, but this would not be true for individuals facing ostensibly similar pressure around different health matters down the line unless they happen to be in a robust union.

(Masks are required outside one’s house, both indoors and outdoors, given the high population density.) His trial began today (05/08), during which his behaviour led him to be remanded for psychiatric assessment.  In today’s trial, Glynn  * claims to be a sovereign citizen and laws do not apply to him * says that he is ‘wide awake’, ‘enlightened’ and researched ‘everything’ but 'believes nothing' * mentions: ‘The certificate of vaccine regulations do not apply to the living man and I'm well aware of this fact.’ * claims to have ‘studied the law for hundreds and thousands of hours’ ([source](https://mothership.sg/2021/08/british-expat-no-mask-sovereign/))  In addition, a Singaporean man who was meant to be Glynn’s legal counsel was found to not be a solicitor. When asked, the man said he was ‘ambassador at large and advocate of Kingdom Filipina Hacienda’. The judge therefore ordered him to watch from the audience gallery.  Current discussion online seems to be divided on whether Glynn is truly mentally unwell. The prosecution received a letter from his family, stating that they have noticed a marked change in his behaviour which started after restrictions set in, with ‘leanings towards certain conspiracy theories’.

He called the proceedings ""preposterous"" and ""disgusting"".  &gt; His supporters filled the courtroom, with one woman repeatedly laughing and another clapping loudly when Glynn slammed Singapore's judiciary. Court officers stepped in to stop them at various points.  &gt; Thursday was meant to be Glynn's first day of trial, but he insisted he would not be pleading guilty or not guilty as it was ""nonsense"".  &gt; The hearing opened with Glynn trying to introduce his legal counsel, a Mr Abdul Rashid Abdul Rahman. He had appeared in court with Glynn previously, but was stopped at the door for improper attire.  &gt; Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh told the court that the prosecution had performed their checks and confirmed that Mr Abdul Rashid was not an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore.  &gt; Mr Abdul Rashid said he is not, but that he is an ""ambassador at large and advocate of Kingdom Filipina Hacienda"", and that he was there to defend his ""sovereign compatriot"".  &gt; He said he understood the meaning of the bar, but said ""I don't need a licence to practice"".  &gt; Mr Koh told the court that the prosecution would be making an application for Glynn to be assessed at IMH, to see if he is of unsound mind.  &gt; **FAMILY AND FRIENDS SENT LETTER ON GLYNN'S BEHAVIOUR**  &gt; ""Prosecution has received a letter from the accused's family and friends or persons purporting to be his family and friends and in this letter, the persons report a marked change of behaviour in the accused's person that was noticeable especially after the COVID restrictions set in,"" he said.  &gt; Given this new information, as well as Glynn's behaviour in court and previous hearings and his choice of counsel, the prosecution said it would be ""prudent"" to assess Glynn to ensure he is of sound mind and capable of making his defence.  &gt; Glynn interrupted at multiple points. He told District Judge Eddy Tham: ""I assure you my mind is very sound. Every time I ask you hard questions, you can't answer me, you shoot me down. What law have I broken? I asked you three times the last time, you gave me silence, silence, silence.""  &gt; He added that he was ""wide awake"", ""enlightened"" and researched ""everything"" but believes nothing.  &gt; When Mr Koh added that Glynn's family members have reported his ""increasing hostility"" towards them, Glynn interjected: ""The certificate of vaccine regulations do not apply to the living man and I'm well aware of this fact.""  &gt; ""Why have the mask regulations been dropped all over American and Europe? Because they are unconstitutional. I don't get my information from the Straits Times.""  &gt; He asked if the prosecutor had seen his ""sovereign ID"", adding that he felt like ""a PhD law lecturer dealing with a GCE law student"".  &gt; He claimed that the police ""kidnapped and abducted"" him on his daughter's birthday, arresting him a second time at his hotel.  &gt; ""I hid in the bathroom and I said - I do not consent, I do not comply. They dragged me out of the shower and handcuffed me. I asked them what crime am I accused of committing. Silence,"" Glynn continued.  &gt; He claimed he spent 18 days ""being tortured in Changi Prison"".  &gt; ""What kind of justice is this, this is preposterous, and the torts against either living man that have been done against me include two unlawful arrests, two false imprisonments, two trespasses against me. They've stolen my passport, my God-given right to travel,"" he said.  &gt; He added that he understood the law ""better than anyone you've ever dealt with before"" and demanded to be released and sent back to England with his family, ""and let's not have a big fuss and scene over this"".  &gt; He continued that his defence is ""very solid and water-tight"" and that the prosecutor ""has no control over my legal fiction"".  &gt; ""I will never plead guilty or not guilty. I can't believe this has been going on since the 8th of May,"" Glynn said.  &gt; ""It's so straightforward it's so clear that this sham of a case should be dropped.""  &gt; A woman in the public gallery burst out laughing soon after this, and another woman waved two thumbs up at Glynn.  &gt; Judge Tham ordered Glynn to be remanded at IMH for two weeks and return to court on Aug 19.  &gt; At this, Glynn raised his voice, saying this is ""absolutely outrageous injustice"".  &gt; ""I am disgusted. How can you send an innocent man to prison when he has not been found guilty and the charges do not apply to him ... I am disgusted at how the Singapore judicial system has treated me and my family,"" he said.  &gt; The woman who had raised her thumbs at Glynn clapped very loudly at this point, and the judge reminded her to observe court decorum.  &gt; As proceedings wound down, Glynn called to the prosecutor: ""Good luck getting into the book of life, Mr Koh. Good luck with that one. How can you say Singapore is a safe country. Police who hunt me down like a pack of wild animals. This is not justice. This is disgusting.

72,0,1627300332,"Double-jabbed expats free to travel to UK under relaxed vaccine rules People vaccinated overseas will be able to visit loved ones without having to self-isolate or undergo expensive tests   By Charles Hymas,  HOME AFFAIRS EDITOR ;  Harry Yorke,  WHITEHALL EDITOR and  Maighna Nanu 25 July 2021 • 9:30pm Eva Baroja and her boyfriend Alberto Eva Baroja and her boyfriend Alberto. Ms Baroja, a 25-year-old from Madrid, says the fact that the UK refuses to recognise vaccines administered in Spain 'does not make sense' Double-vaccinated expats are set to be free to travel to the UK, as the Government plans to recognise foreign jabs from August 1.  British families and couples have been separated by the current restriction on quarantine-free travel to and from amber list countries because the Government only recognises those people who have been vaccinated by the NHS.  However, ministers are preparing to change the rules to allow UK nationals who have been vaccinated overseas to register the jabs with their GP, clearing the way for them to return to the UK to visit family and friends without having to self-isolate for 10 days and pay for two PCR tests.  It could benefit some 300,000 expat British citizens living in just eight of the main EU countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and Portugal, 700,000 Britons in the US and a further 150,000 in France, once it is removed from its current ""amber-plus"" status.   Ministers are also expected to open up quarantine-free travel ""very soon"" to foreign nationals in a reciprocal deal with 33 countries that have recognised the NHS app.  This means that potentially millions of EU and US residents could visit the UK to see relatives living here - and it would open up the multi-billion-pound inward visitor market, which has been reduced to a fraction of pre-pandemic levels.  The changes come amid growing speculation that France might be returned to amber within the next fortnight, ending the “amber-plus” requirement for all arrivals from the country, including fully jabbed Britons, to quarantine for 10 days.  It follows a sharp decline in the prevalence of the beta variant of the covid virus in France, from nine per cent of cases to 2.6 per cent, the prime reason for the restrictions being imposed last week.  Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccines minister, foreshadowed the move on foreign jabs in a little-noticed debate in the Commons last week.  Vaccines Minister Nadim Zahawi pictured earlier this year Vaccines Minister Nadim Zahawi pictured earlier this year CREDIT: Heathcliff O'Malley/Heathcliff O'Malley He said: “By the end of this month, UK nationals who have been vaccinated overseas will be able to talk to their GP, go through what vaccine they have had and have it registered with the NHS that they have been vaccinated.  “The reasons for the conversation with the GP is to make sure that whatever vaccine they have had is approved in the UK. Ultimately there will be co-ordination between the WHO, ourselves, the European regulator and US regulator and other regulators around the world.  “Because we are working at speed at the moment, it is UK nationals and citizens who have had UK vaccinations who will be able to travel to amber list countries other than France and come back and not quarantine.  “We want to offer the same reciprocity as the 33 countries that recognise our app and that will also happen very soon.”  The 33 countries include Anguilla, Greece, Ireland, Barbados, Bulgaria, the Cayman Islands, Croatia, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Iceland, Malta, Portugal, Spain, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Turkey, Germany and France.  Placeholder image for youtube video: g_ktqpHY4ac Most EU countries are part of the bloc’s travel pass scheme, which records both tests and vaccinations. The picture in the US is, however, more complicated with individual US states having different approaches to vaccination with 50 different types of certificate, some solely on paper.  Joss Croft, chief executive of UKinbound, welcomed Mr Zahawi’s “incredibly encouraging” comments, but urged the Government to accelerate the process: ‘’We need action now, not just hollow words that reciprocity will hopefully be implemented soon.  “The inbound tourism industry is on its knees and, even if reciprocity is rolled out tomorrow, thousands of businesses and jobs will continue to be at risk, leaving the sector in desperate need of targeted support.’’  Case study: 'I haven't seen my girlfriend in over three months'  Mr Fisher, who works for a marketing consultancy, had hoped that once he was fully vaccinated the situation would change. Mr Fisher, who works for a marketing consultancy, had hoped that once he was fully vaccinated the situation would change Thomas Fisher, 26, is a British and French dual national who has lived in Paris for three years.  His girlfriend and all his close friends live in London. Before the pandemic he used to go back to the capital at least once or twice a month. But Covid restrictions have meant he has only been able to visit twice in over a year.  He told The Telegraph: “There have been periods of time where we haven’t seen each other for over three months because of the travel restrictions imposed by the UK. Before the pandemic we would see each other every other week. Obviously the French vaccine being recognised by the UK would make a big difference for us.""  Mr Fisher, who works for a marketing consultancy, had hoped that once he was fully vaccinated the situation would change.  He said: “I literally check the news all the time to see if there are any plans on the UK accepting the French vaccine because that would allow me to go to the UK and see my friends. It would be a lot more flexible because I wouldn't have to quarantine.""  Mr Fisher said the fact his double vaccination is not recognised is ""annoying.""  He added: ""It feels like you're being discriminated against because I am British, and it is the exact same vaccine. I am not planning on going to the UK for a while because I am not going to do the quarantine.""  Case study: Fees and quarantine are 'an injustice'  Eva Baroja, a 25-year-old from Madrid, says the fact that the UK refuses to recognise vaccines administered in Spain ""does not make sense"".  Ms Baroja, whose boyfriend of seven years, Alberto, lives in London, says the pandemic has been ""really hard"" as they waited for restrictions to be lifted.  She was fully vaccinated with Pfizer at the beginning of July, but says if she wanted to travel to London she would have to pay upwards of €300 and quarantine upon arrival. She called the restrictions ""an injustice.""  She told The Telegraph: ""If British people are fully vaccinated they can holiday in Majorca and Ibiza and have a great summer and go back home without quarantining. But I have to pay for three Covid tests and self-quarantine just to visit my boyfriend in London.""  If the UK does recognise vaccines given to foreign nationals overseas, it means that Ms Baroja and her family will be able to visit Alberto in London in two weeks. If not, her parents will have to cancel their trip.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/orwyl3/doublejabbed_expats_free_to_travel_to_uk_under/h6ks40p/
73,1,1627301294,"Not the person you're asking, but I'll try to give my view in good faith. The closest I came to taking the vaccine was when it looked like July 19th was happening with no ifs or buts. Maybe I was wrong to think the government were going to end up trying to force this on me, I thought. Maybe it was conspiracy nonsense after all. And that lasted, what, 17 hours? On the evening of July 19th Bojo announces that the vax pass will become mandatory in nightclubs and *other unspecified settings* with no option for a negative test instead. Call it what you like, I call it coercion at the very least. Please spare me the comparison with driving licenses or yellow fever certificates.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm tempted to say ""Fine, I'll get this vaccine but then I'm done"" but I know full well that when this passport/certificate is brought in, booster shots can be put on there and now I've bought into a system where my previous 2 jabs were for nout if I haven't had the latest booster. That's not even unlikely, seeing as they're already talking about booster jabs for the vulnerable this autumn, and initially they were considering only vaccinating the vulnerable full stop. It may not happen yet, but there'll inevitably by a variant that crops up that ""requires"" the latest booster, or it will become apparent that immunity wanes significantly over time. Only anti-vaxxers would only have 2 doses, right? And so the cycle continues.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oru8ci/unjabbed_students_face_ban_as_boris_johnson/h6ktj3f/
74,2,1627322011,"If you have this level of paranoia on a simple thing like a temporary vaccine passport, how do you even live without the oppressive thought that you could be erased by any public or private database (let alone your data being stolen, sold and used to identify and blackmail you or stuff like that) at ANY point in time, any day?  The government/any hacker could literally wipe out your existence by ""losing"" your NHS number, passport record, birth certificate record, PAYE records and pension contributions, bank account and so on. ANY time. Good luck proving you are not an illegal immigrant and have right to work once all your records have been wiped out and yours documents deemed forged.  Yet, I guess you do not begin your day thinking whether you still exist in some database.  A vaccine record is no different. Also, no democratic country with a serious balance of powers ever had problems with IDs.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/orylcc/vaccine_passports_arent_just_unfair_they_dont_work/h6m0rzw/
75,3,1627332519,The yellow vaccine passport/certificate isn't a QR code on an app on your smart phone though. It is simply a piece of yellow cardboard from your vaccinator. Unlike these covid passports it doesn't provide data to a private corporation/government agency everytime it is checked/used and it only applies to international travel.   Also to be really pedantic most South America countries don't check for it anymore due to yellow fever being less of a threat there now. Only in sub-Saharan Africa is it enforced.,unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oreyuz/covid_vaccine_passports_premier_league_matches/h6monfw/

77,0,1627154600,"I got vaccinated here in France mainly because I'd rather be vaccinated.  It'll be a mess for a while but I'm hoping I can get my EU vaccine certificate converted to a UK one once I'm back next week.  I'm not expecting anything to be fixed soon, as the UK seems to be as obstructive as possible for the sake of it, maybe it makes them feel special.  Being in the special amber+ country due to France having overseas territories - wtf you can work out that the Canaries/Azores are not part of mainland Spain/Portugal but not for Reunion etc.  So it doesn't actually make a difference because everyone has to quarantine.  Travel between London and Paris used to be so simple - now it is a bureaucratic nightmare thanks to the brexit and covid dividends - I can't even bring my house plants home now either :(",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oqv4qf/are_brits_abroad_waiting_until_they_return_to_the/h6e9p8n/
78,1,1627164287,"Not even remotely the same. An inconsequential piece of material that you can remove after your journey versus an experimental, unlicensed vaccine that by September almost 90% of adults will have had anyway so the benefit of vaccine passports will be virtually zero.  Why does everyone who supports vaccine passports love making false equivalences?

They're even talking about reserving the right to make them mandatory for supermarkets.  https://news.sky.com/video/covid-19-govt-reserves-right-to-make-vaccine-passports-mandatory-in-some-settings-12361258  ""Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said that essential services such as supermarkets will not need proof of COVID certification for entry, but the government will reserve the right to mandate its use in the future'.""  &gt;But the broad consensus is pro as far as I can make out.  I'm struggling to see any broad consensus from the scientific community. The main people in favour of it are the cabinet of the most authoritarian government in recent times, even a fair number of MPs from the same party are speaking out against it.  &gt;If you’ve already had Covid and can prove it, you are eligible for a pass.  As above, only proof of vaccination is going to be sufficient from September. Starting with nightclubs and then expanding. Regardless, that's missing the point somewhat. You shouldn't really need a certificate to take part in society.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oqkio1/covid19_govt_reserves_right_to_make_vaccine/h6go87b/
