I'm starting over from scratch myself at 36, lost my life savings in the collapse and banks bankruptcy and my gym failed through 2 years of covid and economic meltdown.  I wasn't in the explosion vicinity. I had moved back to my hometown in zahle just a month before it because I couldn't afford beirut anymore. Like you my long term relationship fell apart after that because I'm not emotionally nor mentally available to anything or anyone nowadays.  I have no foreign passport to fall back on though, but managed to squeeze through a position in my old career outside lebanon, so we'll see if that works out.  As others said, you have nothing to lose, and although it will be a struggle to find the will to live on some days, we gotta, right?",lebanon,t5_2qzpg,/r/lebanon/comments/ruy1c6/so_after_nearly_two_years_of_doing_nothing_im/hr24tkh/
1,0,1633979028,I mean tbh nurses and doctors and the likes can go anywhere now since already there was a high demand for them everywhere and now there’s the Covid pandemic so it’s even easier to get a job abroad + a visa and even something long term (10 year residence or passport) in nations like Canada or the US or countries in EU,lebanon,t5_2qzpg,/r/lebanon/comments/q5qf1u/whats_up_with_all_lebanese_people_going_to_dubai/hg9gb21/

3,0,1629276230,"&gt; Is it even possible to find a job in any European country, while living and applying from Lebanon? For example I have 3 years experience as a developer, but I only have the Lebanese passport..   This is very hard to do from here, especially now when there is an economic crisis everywhere in the world. Most go study there and then apply for jobs. The reason is that to get you there they have to both justify that they can't hire someone local that can do the same job, and they have to pay something like 2k€ to get your paperwork ready.  I have some friends who were lucky and moved there but it was before the crisis, even before covid...   Still, if you keep digging and applying non-stop you might get ""lucky""  and get a job if you tell them you'd work for peanuts. I know some people working at the minimum salary just to move to Europe.",lebanon,t5_2qzpg,/r/lebanon/comments/p6n34k/finding_a_job_abroad/h9e0lx5/

6,0,1617639457,"The vaccine passport is not new. Polio was widespread until vaccination campaigns ended it. Hepatitis vaccines also lowered the rates immensely, same for mumps and rubella and so on and guess what? They were all mandatory w ma ken fik tetsajal bel madrase balehon.  The only reason you are not seeing the horrors of these diseases is because their vaccine was mandatory.  &gt;To comply to live in safety at the expense of personal freedom of choice is a price many are willing to pay until you no longer have freedom whatsoever  Bro aside from the vaccine which will lessen the amount of carriers so as not to kill people, what freedoms are impeded? ""They"" can literally fund a mercenary army to genocide an entire continent and no one would give a shit. And if a shit was given, then given how strong ""they"" re made out to be, they can silence the shit.   If they wanted to impede on freedoms, covid was a dumb was to got about it.",lebanon,t5_2qzpg,/r/lebanon/comments/mklj39/antivaxxers_protest_against_wearing_face_masks/gtgujjj/
