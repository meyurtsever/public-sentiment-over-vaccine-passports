But foreign news tried to make it seem like it's some Martians from outer space just backed by russia or something.   &gt;the numbers of fatalities throughout this conflict are much much lower than potential ones in hypothetical open all out war  That's the CEASEFIRE casualties. Cease fire. Has them bomb us dozen of times every day. And then Germany or France whines if Ukraine fires back.  Another problem is that it's hybrid war. They found a very effective weapon that kills much more than russian artillery could dream off: antivaxxers. Russians use insane amounts of money on disinformation campaign and since pandemic started they've been working full time on providing COVID disinformation. Actually several statements by investigators and tons of research backing it up.  It also explains a statistical anomaly: why the hell is Ukraine the lowest-vaccinated country in Europe? It's SIGNIFICANTLY behind others, probably the only state where there's so many idiots paying money to get a fake certificate instead of getting a free vaccine and spend whole 20 seconds in a mobile app to get certified. Here you go, SBU apprehended antivaxxers working for Kremlin: https://imi.org.ua/en/news/charges-pressed-against-russia-handled-anti-vaxxers-who-aimed-to-seize-power-ukrinform-i42393  A typical anti-vax group leader passport: https://www.jpost.com/international/ukraine-says-it-thwarted-plan-by-anti-vaxxers-to-destabilize-country-685309 P.S. REALLY hate their narrative overall, they're the worst kind of news, the ""happy pretender"" ones, not only apprehending some of many disinformation networks doesn't thwart the entire plan, just throws a spanner there, but also their attitude of a ""possible"", ""future"" invasion instead of ongoing war that might be escalated. If people actually used the right words, i.e. a ""full scale offensive campaign"" instead of ""starting an invasion"", it would be less confusing to people who don't follow Ukrainian news for yeats.  Another article on the overall shebang, citing real good sources: https://www.codastory.com/disinformation/ukraine-vaccine-hesitancy/  On bright side, russians do get hoisted by their own petard too: https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/covid-19-disinformation-backfires-russian-deaths-climb-eu-says-2021-10-21/   So yes, they can kill way more people if they use aircraft and/or lead another full scale offensive like in 2014 or 15, but the most effective weapon is the ""vaccine skepticism,"" with way higher mortality rate than any war. Literally daily deaths from COVID are higher than yearly death toll from the war.   UKRAINE IS SECOND BY DAILY CORONA DEATHS IN THE WORLD, only behind russia: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ (click ""yesterday"" tab for full statistics). And since our population is less than half of their, per capita, we're actually leading... Their disinformation WORKS. Yeah our army needs to reinforce borders and go over several plans of defense, get equipped and ready for any scenario - that goes without given, it's their job... but #1 priority is not fucking dying out from a preventable illness.

1,0,1635635724,Well is it really positive tho? You‚Äôre way behind in vaccinations when most countries have already nearly vaccinated all of their population.

8,0,1628198460,"August 5 update:   TLTR: If you‚Äôre vaccinated, have their insurance printed out, and you‚Äôre not from Russia or India -  everything will go smooth.  ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî We got JJ vaccine 5 days before we left US. Neither upon checkin or upon arrival in Ukraine that date was questioned.   Upon check in (KLM) - requested vaccine card and proof of insurance. Although our American insurance covers us internationally, we bought the one from the website just to avoid any issues.   KLM plane was half full. Very friendly. Everyone was mostly in compliance with mask requirements and had an empty space between their party and another party.   Layover/transfer in Amsterdam - no issues. Only looked at passport and boarding pass.   Both journeys requested social distancing when exiting the plane - both times that was completely ignored. Worse on the Amsterdam to Kiev arm.   On the Amsterdam to Kiev flight, one older man didn‚Äôt want to cover his nose with mask, so the flight attendants was getting angry with him and threatened to turn the plane around if he didn‚Äôt comply. Although many others had their masks slightly below their noses, I guess his was just more obvious. He eventually covered his face until she walked away.   Getting though border patrol at boryspil airport:  Again, no social distancing followed at all. We arrived at around 2pm - it was busy. Before getting in line, man in uniform ask to see vaccination record or proof of negative test. If someone held up the line, some  snuck through without showing anything. The line for foreign citizens was pst the UA citizens entry line, but somehow Ukrainian citizens ended up in the foreign line so they converted one of the station from ‚Äúall passports‚Äù to ‚ÄúUA citizens.‚Äù So it was ‚Äúall passports‚Äù ‚ÄúUA citizens‚Äù ‚Äúall passports‚Äù ‚ÄúUA citizens‚Äù X5.   Some people were cutting in line, but no one would say anything, I guess because we weren‚Äôt sure if they were catching up with their other family members. A couple were. Most weren‚Äôt. People working at the airport paid zero attention to that.   The lines were getting backed up by people why either didn‚Äôt have proof of insurance printed and clearly showing coverage in Ukraine, or if they weren‚Äôt vaccinated and struggled to activate the ‚ÄúVdoma‚Äù app. I did not see any Russian or Indian citizens (explain more later).    Once I got to the border patrol, I gave him my passport, CDC vaccination card, and printed copy of UA insurance. He only asked the name of my vaccine, which after 24 hrs of traveling and not sleeping (can‚Äôt sleep on planes) I struggled withüòÖ. Asked me to lower my mask and take off my glasses, stared at my face for what felt like forever and let me go.   Once we got our luggage we went through the green customs line (not having to declare anything), but a girl came up to us to ask where we were coming from, what we were bringing and how much money we had. We said personal belongings and the amount was under the restricted amount. She smiled and said thank you so we went on.   Next we needed to get a taxi. The signs where to get taxi weren‚Äôt clear. The security at the door  wasn‚Äôt helpful. Tired and just wanting to get to our place of rest we went outside and took up one of the guys offering the taxi. The price was $35, which is about 2.5 times the fair market value (I checked beforehand). The guy acts as a call agent and takes half from the taxi driver he calls. At this point we didn‚Äôt mind, similar trip would be similarly priced in the US. Thankfully we got a nice and polite driver with Citrion that fit our 4 bags of luggage.   About Indians and Russians. When we walked outside the terminal, there were many camera men and journalists. Someone even came up to us to take interview - we weren‚Äôt interested. Later on TV saw a segment about all the people they were defining from Russia. Rules for Russia and India require that anyone arriving in boryspil EVEN IF TRANSFERRING quarantine in Ukraine for 14 days without possibility of testing. There are families traveling  from Turkey to Russia through Ukraine and now they have to stay in Ukraine for 2 weeks. Given what I said earlier about how no one gave a *** about social distancing lines, I don‚Äôt see how this 2 week rule helps the COVID situation. Obviously they showed some very upset people, one guy punched the border patrol person, one threw his phone on the ground, another tried to bribe the agent. This was upsetting to watch and I am glad we didn‚Äôt see any of it in person while at the airport.   General observation about Boryspil. All staff speaks to you in Ukrainian before speaking English. Maybe because I was born there and still have my round Eastern European cheeks, but I found it weird for an international airport - main in the country. Some staff obviously didn‚Äôt speak English. If I didn‚Äôt know Russian or Ukrainian - this would stress me out. Overall I was hoping for more cleanliness, order, and organization. It wasn‚Äôt terrible, but I think they can and should improve their catering towards foreign citizens. Especially coming from Schiphol airport - the contrast was night and day. There were some Dutch, Americans, Canadians, and middle eastern tourists in the foreign line with us and I had wished their first impression of Ukraine could be better.   This is too long and has too many details, but hey, maybe someone will find it interesting/helpful.   Stay positive! Test negative! ‚ù§Ô∏è",ukraine,t5_2qqcn,/r/ukraine/comments/owkwce/us_to_ukraine/h7uw7ag/
