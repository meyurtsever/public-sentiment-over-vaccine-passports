The fine is calculated based on how long you overstayed, the people who work there are the biggest dicks on the planet to literally everyone, even if you're PM Modi-ji.  * You'll be given an a special exit permit which is stamped red in your passport and told to leave within 48 hours.  ---  Don't bother booking any flights before you've spoken to the FRRO as you'll be rejected at the check-in desk or dragged off the flight before it takes off, it's really embarrassing.  Make sure to print out and take photocopies of all receipts for medical treatment - like three copies, it's insane but they will ask for it... Also print out your hotel receipt as they will want evidence of where you stayed whilst you overstayed. I don't know why, it's stupid, but it's something they ask for.  Be prepared to wait anywhere from 2 weeks to 3 months to get the red exit visa stamp...

Not only that what about the fact only 30% of the population is doubly vaccinated to reach a certain  level of herd immunity ? These are not complete protection, \*if\* a new variant strikes , which again can be a possibility there is a good chance the country will again suffer, not as much as the second wave but even then there could be serious problems and we could be forced into a lockdown if shit hits the fan.  70% of our population has taken the vaccine but a recent survey by India today showed 7% of the population still hesitant to take the vaccine. 7 % is 7 crore people (check source) . That number is big enough to create problems. Do I guarantee there will be problems ? NO. Do I fear there will be problems ? YES, as should you.

Vaccines dont work if some people take it and some dont.  The geographical distribution and climatic conditions of those who are unvaccinated could create new variants with localized outbreaks, which can snowball into something else. You should read a little more news before asking people what the fuck they are on about, reflects poorly on you.  Plan B was published officially on September 27. The leaked documents were about the cost it would be and their line of thinking. [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/oct/26/covid-plan-b-uk-economy-cost-leaked-documents).  They are thinking about it, its not a hypothetical. Last time around he tried to do the same deny a lockdown etc and then went on to impose it anyway , how sure are you things will be  different this time ? They might not jump up to a proper lockdown but a mask mandate, vaccine passport and  booster dose is still a real possibility , unless you have a solid argument to deny that they wont ever do it. Israel itself started with the vaccine passport again, what makes you think India is in a better position with 30% fully vaccinated, no booster shots, no kids vaccination in sight. The third wave is here, the cases will rise and the government(s) with its tail tucked between its legs will again impose 8pm curfew and compulsory mask in public.  Capabilities have improved, only because we have vaccinated the population.  I am not wearing a tin foil hat screaming 400k cases a day here, I am still looking towards a significant damage if we are all not too prepared. Which I feel we are not there. Since I am not an expert I will not throw out a random number ,but going by trends I am observing in other countries we might be looking at 100k cases in the third wave and that could be devastating.  Finally, I can very freely criticize the governments chest thumping whenever I want. The person on the chair has been hired to do a job and I am not that person. The chest thumping comment was an observation to what is happening, people have already started being complacent, removing masks and everything since ' capabilities have improved.' I was simply trying to put forward my assessment that the country is getting complacent and I stand by my words.

11,0,1634430415,"Just as a counterpoint - I’ve been living in sg for 15 years (or in context practically all of my adult life). This post is one persons viewpoint, and with selective/recent media attention on some prompts that were politically motivated.      There are few people that are racist. The Govt isn’t, and the people that I interact with (work, housing, hospitals, restaurants, malls, vegetable Mandi, bus/train/cabs) aren’t racist.      The racist overtones are from the opposition MPs (presumably looking for leverage in the voting masses). The rest is from online trolls &amp; ill-informed random people posting messages (for all you know could be non-state actors like China).         There is discrimination against foreigners in general, in jobs/housing/school admissions - but there is a clear rationale to prioritise locals (even if discriminatory in end results). It’s not like there is a board saying, “Indians and dogs not allowed”.  The other factor is that India and China form the largest block of qualified persons applying for mid level jobs and there is ratio/quota of locals vs foreigners. For applications for permanent residency or citizenship, Indians specifically lose out to China mainland applicants, as there is a policy to maintain racial percentages and Chinese are at 70% while Indians are 10% approx - so there is some background to why a Chinese colleague.          some Indians here have felt the weight of the rulebook thrown at them for minor infractions such as loud music at late hours, which in India might have been brushed aside with, “tere baap ka colony hai kya?”. Typical shit like trying to cut queues, bypass rules, treat service staff like “servants” - which obviously gets some people riled up as that’s not the local culture - contributes to a bad impression (though I’ll clarify that the locals I interact with have the sense to not club all Indians in one category, much as back home you’ll not club all Bengali’s as “yeh tho communist hoga”).        All that said, yes it’s difficult now to retain work passes, retain jobs and it’s a tough life. But that’s more covid related than racism.

27,0,1621346081,"I posted about it before, but I was done cobbling together a system that worked and then exhausted myself keeping it going through all the grift, inefficiency and corruption.   I'm not saying immigration is a 100% success for everyone - I've witnessed so much go wrong for people who only had hope for something better, but it was a risk I took and it paid off. I work at a company that respects and values my work and encourages me to grow professionally, bosses who aren't raging, micromanaging assholes, made 10x more money than I would have in India, learnt so much from colleagues who keep me competitive. It's quiet, have a small friends circle here and I'm happy.   My favourite thing about life here is specifically the community amenities I get access to - I pay a small fee to access the community rec centre over here. They conduct classes for the elderly for physical fitness, a full fledged gym and a full-sized swimming pool. FFS people who train professionally for the Olympics use this space for their own training (albeit with their own focused trainers) a few times a week. Just by virtue of living in this city I get free access to a library and can rent books for free, digitally or actual books. They even have video games for free rent or movies. The library also has ESL courses (I used to volunteer there and once covid is done, I'll go back to my other favourite thing to do, which was drop off book requests to elderly folks in the neighborhood) and resources to help people train for interviews. A while back they even had a 'legal eagle' day of the week where a pro-bono lawyer would be sitting there for people to ask for free legal advice. Come tax season, there's tax clinics to help the disadvantages sort their taxes out. I can honestly say that I feel more a part of a bigger community here and the willingness to give back vs back in India.  Another favourite thing is the one thing that actually gets thrown around as a disadvantage - the fact that you need to do everything yourself and don't have a maid/servant for anything. Personally, I love learning new things and doing things myself. There's a certain catharsis in seeking perfection in something you've done yourself. My dad taught me a little bit of mechanics work when I was younger (it was a must to look after my old '57 Bullet) and I know a little bit of carpentry (not to my dad's level, he built all the furniture in their first flat). Once this covid thing is done I'll be joining a community college shop class here in the GTA to teach me how to make stuff too. My landlord remodeled a bathroom last year and was happy to have me as a second pair of hands to learn how he did it, so now I know how to do tiling and basic plumbing, which is awesome.    Having said that, no place is perfect - Canada has its flaws too. Housing is overinflated here in populous areas with the govt. working actively to keep it that way than acknowledge it. Sure, the weather is difficult for 4 months of the year, but then again - where has India had idyllic weather? I'd be roasting my ass off in the humid Mumbai weather or wading through god-knows-what during the monsoons, so compared to that, how could you even complain about being nice and warm indoors or kitting up to walk around in snow for winter? You can fix cold weather by wearing more stuff, you can be stark naked in the heat of an Indian summer and still be roasting.   I still miss India though - there are some days where I have dreams that I wake up in my Mumbai flat and I go to catch the 255 Ltd to Oshiwara and the hustle and bustle. I'll always love and miss the portions of India I adored, but I cannot abide with the things that I cannot change nor like. I am still not averse to the idea of settling back in India at some point when I'm older, but I feel like I have the tools and ability to be my best self outside India.   A common criticism of this is that 'you are not contributing to improving the land you left'. This isn't really true either and I'm not obliged to prove my fealty - I have my own means of making an impact even though I don't live in India anymore and I shouldn't have to defend an action that is for the betterment of my countrymen. If every one of us took a step to uplift the life of at least young person around us and be the big brother/big sister to them, a lot of the problems we talk about - lack of education, lack of resources - would be effectively dealt with.There is a growing gap of not just financial inequity within India (which affects even the reads of this subreddit). There is a 'knowledge inequity' as well - a lot of the people that need help, need access to that help which could come from you to grow. They need that direction. I mentioned in an earlier post just yesterday that a majority of Indian youth don't have soft skills in a way that can help with their employability. Companies clearly don't want to invest in growing talent anymore because it hurts their margins.   What some people don't realize is that a majority of you have the capacity, even if it's limited, to be the world for someone else. For example - My sister and I are financially assisting my parents in helping a single mum (and daily wage worker) that lives in the basement of our building to look after her small daughter. That woman looks up to my parents and in return, my parents are doing their best to change that child's life for the better. We've both been sending care packages from here, we Facetime regularly and we get to see the little one too and she's started talking in two languages now - Kannada and thanks to my mom, English too. My mom is using the Preeti Sagar sing-a-long tapes she used when we were kids for the little girl too, and she loves it. I've already set up funds (mostly earned from Canada) to look after her education and materials and my dad is helping both the lady and her daughter for all administrative stuff, like getting their documentation and working through even things like passport applications. They're fully documented, my dad helped them get bank accounts, taught the lady how to use an ATM, how to buy basic appliances. Everyone is happy (my parents adore children and my mom misses teaching, so she's enjoying this, as is the little one; her mother is learning to be more independent and self-sufficient and gaining confidence in herself). We can sit and point at the failures of the government all day long for not having some of the tools people can use to be self-sufficient, but we are just as culpable if we don't work to do anything ourselves.   Anyway, that was my long post for the day - seeing these posts come up has had these thoughts in my mind for a good long while now.",india,t5_2qh1q,/r/india/comments/nezsm0/emigrate_used_to_be_a_meme_on_rindia_i_cannot/gykhrkh/

If anything, a country should ensure safety of it’s passport holders, that’s what passports are for, not shut their doors when things are not pleasant.",india,t5_2qh1q,/r/india/comments/n5xic2/australian_pms_cartoon_after_banning_australian/gx4urgy/

The staff check your name and match it with the passport name. They also check if the word negative is there.   That is all basically.   Any 10th student can edit a PDF file and produce a report. It is a joke.   Most reports have QR codes, why don't they just scan the QR code and verify the authenticity?",india,t5_2qh1q,/r/india/comments/n5b3js/breaking_sky_news_understands_there_has_been_two/gx0rqxp/

Your vaccination status verification happens electronically, so the country in question will only accept one unique beneficiary ID per passport.    Talk to the Indian high commission in the country she has to go to, and also talk to a senior member of your local covid task force.   Expect some delays in responses. Start the communication with the concerned authorities right away so that you'll have some resolution by the time she is able to leave.

There's a new option now known as the STV (special tourist visa) which gives you a total of 9months and that will require you to get a certificate of entry showing you are covid-negative, health insurance covering covid-19, and a quarantine booking. So, if you came with that visa, you'd have plenty of time to explore after quarantine but that option is now off the table too with the new wave.

Can confirm it's a great choice if you're here doing something you love, love the outdoors and want to raise a family generally living a relaxed way of life.     However, be warned that it's not all rainbows &amp; unicorns here either (but you'll find lots of sheep, cows, etc!).The Immigration scenario has worsened thanks to COVID and once it improves, the focus will be (rightly so) on attracting and retaining only the highly skilled migrants (2X median income threshold, meeting English language requirements, educational qualifications per role, etc.)     Apart from this, there's the ever looming Housing Bubble/crisis.Whoever's remotely interested in being a part of our #TeamOf5Million, i'd suggest you thoroughly do your own research and talk to people. Also, keep your ass away from those crazy agents and consultants who will sell you the passport from day 1!  Good luck!",india,t5_2qh1q,/r/india/comments/lwjndr/where_do_you_wanna_move_to/gpn6ztj/
