On December 21, the EU [adopted rules](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_6837) requiring that member states invalidate EU COVID passes 270 days after the last vaccination. This left me in the precarious position of my French COVID pass expiring two days before my flight!  The mechanism by which this works is the COVID pass *apps* expiring the certificate, because the certificates themselves do not have expiration dates encoded into them. This potentially means that you could screenshot or print your COVID pass QR code, present that without the app, and all would be fine. However, there is reason to believe that scanners also do this 270-day calculation and will notify that a COVID pass has expired as the date of the last vaccination is encoded into the QR code. Member states do not need to comply with this directive until February 1st, but nothing stops them from doing it sooner. France has done it already.  There is reason to believe that Norway [will accept just the Swiss COVID pass](https://www.regjeringen.no/en/aktuelt/covid-19-certificates-accepted-from-four-new-countries/id2888338/?expand=factbox2871368) and the French one is unnecessary, but in this thread only the French one has been tested and confirmed.  To rectify my situation, I followed the Swiss COVID application procedure a second time with my updated CDC card reflecting that I received a booster shot. They once again issued me a second certificate within 12 hours, this one reflecting my 3/3 shots, and I was able to scan this into the French app again and receive another EU COVID pass that should last longer. The French pass only becomes ""official"" 7 days after the date you received your last vaccine. Similarly, my Swiss COVID pass is now valid for a year whereas my un-boostered Swiss pass was valid only for 6 months.  Hope this helps someone. Scanning the [list of countries](https://www.regjeringen.no/en/aktuelt/covid-19-certificates-accepted-from-four-new-countries/id2888338/?expand=factbox2871368) sharing their digital COVID databases with Norway it becomes apparent how absurd the US situation is with our idiotic CDC cards.

40,2.0,1625687520.0,"&gt;But I did some more research and found this on helsenorge.no : If you will only have one dose of a vaccine because the type of vaccine you have received only requires one dose, you will be given a green control page three weeks after you were vaccinated.  Where did you read that? On a page for Norwegian citizens or foreign citizens? If it's the former, it's saying that they give you a green vaccine certificate 3 weeks after your dose, but if it's the latter then your own country gives you the green certificate (in the EU COVID ""passport"", that is).   Are you fully vaccinated or not? Do you have a green certificate? If you do, then you should be fine.   &gt;That's not good for us because we were planning to enter Norway within these 3 weeks.. How strict do you think they are at the bordercrossings?  Is that a serious question? They follow the rules, of course.",Norway,t5_2qwrb,/r/Norway/comments/ofketl/johnson_johnson_vaccin/h4e36gl/
41,0.0,1625078011.0,"Copied straight from a Facebook group I'm in (think this is the currently the only available way):  How to get your foreign vaccination approved in Norway  Many group members have contacted me asking how they can get their foreign vaccination approved in Norway.    Firstly, you need to be resident in Norway, alternatively a Norwegian citizen in order for your vaccination to be approved in Norway.  If you are coming to the country as a student or you have landed yourself employment in the country, you can register your vaccination in Norway before your arrival.   In order to register your vaccination in Norway you must have a Norwegian ID number (11 digits) or a D-number.  A D-number is a quick temporary ID you receive after you have arrived in the country.  If you do not have an ID or D number you will need to wait until you have come to Norway to register your vaccination.  You must have been vaccinated with an EMA (European Medicines Agency) approved vaccine in order for your vaccination to be approved in Norway (see my previous post).  If you have had an EMA vaccine this is what you do: You contact your assigned doctor (GP/fastlege) and tell him/her that you want to set up a video session (if you are outside the country) or an appointment (if you are inside the country) to register your vaccination in the Norwegian vaccination register.    If you do not have an assigned doctor, you can contact any private practising doctor at a private clinic in the country, or a municipal health service, or a private health institution.  These are all authorised to see you through the registration process.  If you are outside the country only a video consultation is possible because the doctor must see your vaccination certificate from the country concerned.  Once the doctor has written down all your details, seen your proof of registration and noted when you were vaccinated, where you were vaccinated, and with what you were vaccinated, the doctor will send all this information to the Norwegian vaccine register. Note - all doctor consultations will be paid for in full by the patient.  The Norwegian Health system neither subsidises nor pays for this prosess.  It is you who must pay the whole amount.  Once your vaccination has been approved, you will be able to access your green vaccination certifcate through HelseNorge.no.  If you do not have access to HelseNorge.no then;  a) a friend can do this for you on HelseNorge or   b) you can order a paper copy of your vaccine certifcate.  Note that if you authorise a friend to do this for you, he/she will also have access to all your medical records in Norway.",Norway,t5_2qwrb,/r/Norway/comments/ob2yfq/can_i_get_my_second_jab_in_norway/h3l9a4m/
42,0.0,1624940083.0,"If you live in the US, and have gotten the vaccine in the US... I don't think you'll be getting a Norwegian or European vaccination certificate, since that is meant to verify that you've are registered in the Norwegian or other European vaccination database.  See [https://www.helsenorge.no/en/covid-19-certificate/](https://www.helsenorge.no/en/covid-19-certificate/) \- other European nations have similar rules (which is why European certificates are recognized in Norway and vice versa).  Your one option would be to do as No-Boysenberry suggests, if the vaccine you received is one of the EMA-approved ones.",Norway,t5_2qwrb,/r/Norway/comments/o9u1da/when_can_i_get_a_european_vaccine_passport/h3eknsm/

From next week you only have to go to a quarantine hotel if you're a Norwegian citizen travel from a country with more than 150 cases per 100 000, compared to 25 cases per 100 000 as before.  The reason why you have to go to the hotel even though you are vaccinated is that it would be hard to verify that you have been vaccinated. They are waiting for the EU's vaccination certificate, as it is easier to control when every country has a common digital solution. This is to prevent that people might try to come in by showing fake vaccine certificates. If you're not from the EU, I don't know how the rules will be later.
