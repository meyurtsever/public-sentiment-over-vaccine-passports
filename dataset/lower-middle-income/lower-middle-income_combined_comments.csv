The fine is calculated based on how long you overstayed, the people who work there are the biggest dicks on the planet to literally everyone, even if you're PM Modi-ji.  * You'll be given an a special exit permit which is stamped red in your passport and told to leave within 48 hours.  ---  Don't bother booking any flights before you've spoken to the FRRO as you'll be rejected at the check-in desk or dragged off the flight before it takes off, it's really embarrassing.

Also print out your hotel receipt as they will want evidence of where you stayed whilst you overstayed. I don't know why, it's stupid, but it's something they ask for.

Not only that what about the fact only 30% of the population is doubly vaccinated to reach a certain  level of herd immunity ? These are not complete protection, \*if\* a new variant strikes , which again can be a possibility there is a good chance the country will again suffer, not as much as the second wave but even then there could be serious problems and we could be forced into a lockdown if shit hits the fan.  70% of our population has taken the vaccine but a recent survey by India today showed 7% of the population still hesitant to take the vaccine. 7 % is 7 crore people (check source) . That number is big enough to create problems. Do I guarantee there will be problems ? NO. Do I fear there will be problems ? YES, as should you.

Vaccines dont work if some people take it and some dont.  The geographical distribution and climatic conditions of those who are unvaccinated could create new variants with localized outbreaks, which can snowball into something else. You should read a little more news before asking people what the fuck they are on about, reflects poorly on you.  Plan B was published officially on September 27.

They are thinking about it, its not a hypothetical. Last time around he tried to do the same deny a lockdown etc and then went on to impose it anyway , how sure are you things will be  different this time ? They might not jump up to a proper lockdown but a mask mandate, vaccine passport and  booster dose is still a real possibility , unless you have a solid argument to deny that they wont ever do it. Israel itself started with the vaccine passport again, what makes you think India is in a better position with 30% fully vaccinated, no booster shots, no kids vaccination in sight. The third wave is here, the cases will rise and the government(s) with its tail tucked between its legs will again impose 8pm curfew and compulsory mask in public.  Capabilities have improved, only because we have vaccinated the population.

Since I am not an expert I will not throw out a random number ,but going by trends I am observing in other countries we might be looking at 100k cases in the third wave and that could be devastating.  Finally, I can very freely criticize the governments chest thumping whenever I want. The person on the chair has been hired to do a job and I am not that person. The chest thumping comment was an observation to what is happening, people have already started being complacent, removing masks and everything since ' capabilities have improved.' I was simply trying to put forward my assessment that the country is getting complacent and I stand by my words.

11,11,11,0,1634430415,"Just as a counterpoint - I’ve been living in sg for 15 years (or in context practically all of my adult life). This post is one persons viewpoint, and with selective/recent media attention on some prompts that were politically motivated.      There are few people that are racist. The Govt isn’t, and the people that I interact with (work, housing, hospitals, restaurants, malls, vegetable Mandi, bus/train/cabs) aren’t racist.      The racist overtones are from the opposition MPs (presumably looking for leverage in the voting masses). The rest is from online trolls &amp; ill-informed random people posting messages (for all you know could be non-state actors like China).         There is discrimination against foreigners in general, in jobs/housing/school admissions - but there is a clear rationale to prioritise locals (even if discriminatory in end results). It’s not like there is a board saying, “Indians and dogs not allowed”.  The other factor is that India and China form the largest block of qualified persons applying for mid level jobs and there is ratio/quota of locals vs foreigners. For applications for permanent residency or citizenship, Indians specifically lose out to China mainland applicants, as there is a policy to maintain racial percentages and Chinese are at 70% while Indians are 10% approx - so there is some background to why a Chinese colleague.          some Indians here have felt the weight of the rulebook thrown at them for minor infractions such as loud music at late hours, which in India might have been brushed aside with, “tere baap ka colony hai kya?”. Typical shit like trying to cut queues, bypass rules, treat service staff like “servants” - which obviously gets some people riled up as that’s not the local culture - contributes to a bad impression (though I’ll clarify that the locals I interact with have the sense to not club all Indians in one category, much as back home you’ll not club all Bengali’s as “yeh tho communist hoga”).        All that said, yes it’s difficult now to retain work passes, retain jobs and it’s a tough life. But that’s more covid related than racism.

27,27,27,0,1621346081,"I posted about it before, but I was done cobbling together a system that worked and then exhausted myself keeping it going through all the grift, inefficiency and corruption.   I'm not saying immigration is a 100% success for everyone - I've witnessed so much go wrong for people who only had hope for something better, but it was a risk I took and it paid off. I work at a company that respects and values my work and encourages me to grow professionally, bosses who aren't raging, micromanaging assholes, made 10x more money than I would have in India, learnt so much from colleagues who keep me competitive. It's quiet, have a small friends circle here and I'm happy.   My favourite thing about life here is specifically the community amenities I get access to - I pay a small fee to access the community rec centre over here. They conduct classes for the elderly for physical fitness, a full fledged gym and a full-sized swimming pool. FFS people who train professionally for the Olympics use this space for their own training (albeit with their own focused trainers) a few times a week. Just by virtue of living in this city I get free access to a library and can rent books for free, digitally or actual books. They even have video games for free rent or movies. The library also has ESL courses (I used to volunteer there and once covid is done, I'll go back to my other favourite thing to do, which was drop off book requests to elderly folks in the neighborhood) and resources to help people train for interviews. A while back they even had a 'legal eagle' day of the week where a pro-bono lawyer would be sitting there for people to ask for free legal advice. Come tax season, there's tax clinics to help the disadvantages sort their taxes out. I can honestly say that I feel more a part of a bigger community here and the willingness to give back vs back in India.  Another favourite thing is the one thing that actually gets thrown around as a disadvantage - the fact that you need to do everything yourself and don't have a maid/servant for anything. Personally, I love learning new things and doing things myself. There's a certain catharsis in seeking perfection in something you've done yourself. My dad taught me a little bit of mechanics work when I was younger (it was a must to look after my old '57 Bullet) and I know a little bit of carpentry (not to my dad's level, he built all the furniture in their first flat). Once this covid thing is done I'll be joining a community college shop class here in the GTA to teach me how to make stuff too. My landlord remodeled a bathroom last year and was happy to have me as a second pair of hands to learn how he did it, so now I know how to do tiling and basic plumbing, which is awesome.    Having said that, no place is perfect - Canada has its flaws too. Housing is overinflated here in populous areas with the govt. working actively to keep it that way than acknowledge it. Sure, the weather is difficult for 4 months of the year, but then again - where has India had idyllic weather? I'd be roasting my ass off in the humid Mumbai weather or wading through god-knows-what during the monsoons, so compared to that, how could you even complain about being nice and warm indoors or kitting up to walk around in snow for winter? You can fix cold weather by wearing more stuff, you can be stark naked in the heat of an Indian summer and still be roasting.   I still miss India though - there are some days where I have dreams that I wake up in my Mumbai flat and I go to catch the 255 Ltd to Oshiwara and the hustle and bustle. I'll always love and miss the portions of India I adored, but I cannot abide with the things that I cannot change nor like. I am still not averse to the idea of settling back in India at some point when I'm older, but I feel like I have the tools and ability to be my best self outside India.   A common criticism of this is that 'you are not contributing to improving the land you left'. This isn't really true either and I'm not obliged to prove my fealty - I have my own means of making an impact even though I don't live in India anymore and I shouldn't have to defend an action that is for the betterment of my countrymen. If every one of us took a step to uplift the life of at least young person around us and be the big brother/big sister to them, a lot of the problems we talk about - lack of education, lack of resources - would be effectively dealt with.There is a growing gap of not just financial inequity within India (which affects even the reads of this subreddit). There is a 'knowledge inequity' as well - a lot of the people that need help, need access to that help which could come from you to grow. They need that direction. I mentioned in an earlier post just yesterday that a majority of Indian youth don't have soft skills in a way that can help with their employability. Companies clearly don't want to invest in growing talent anymore because it hurts their margins.   What some people don't realize is that a majority of you have the capacity, even if it's limited, to be the world for someone else. For example - My sister and I are financially assisting my parents in helping a single mum (and daily wage worker) that lives in the basement of our building to look after her small daughter. That woman looks up to my parents and in return, my parents are doing their best to change that child's life for the better. We've both been sending care packages from here, we Facetime regularly and we get to see the little one too and she's started talking in two languages now - Kannada and thanks to my mom, English too. My mom is using the Preeti Sagar sing-a-long tapes she used when we were kids for the little girl too, and she loves it. I've already set up funds (mostly earned from Canada) to look after her education and materials and my dad is helping both the lady and her daughter for all administrative stuff, like getting their documentation and working through even things like passport applications. They're fully documented, my dad helped them get bank accounts, taught the lady how to use an ATM, how to buy basic appliances. Everyone is happy (my parents adore children and my mom misses teaching, so she's enjoying this, as is the little one; her mother is learning to be more independent and self-sufficient and gaining confidence in herself). We can sit and point at the failures of the government all day long for not having some of the tools people can use to be self-sufficient, but we are just as culpable if we don't work to do anything ourselves.

One old dude said that ""I think its safe because the certificate has Modiji's face on it."" Unironically lol. And since he is old and respected, most listened to him and now most of the villagers have had one dose atleast.  We need to remember that India is still mostly uneducated and a lot of uneducated folks worship Modi as a Saint. Having his pic on important campaigns for public health issues would actually be helpful for people to gain trust in vaccines.

87,87,53,0,1639302110,"Just did a Canada to India non stop flight today. Going to share my experience to help others who are contemplating travelling to India right now. Documents: Needed 3 documents in order to complete the whole process as smoothly as possible: Negative RTPCR, Air Suvidha, Vaccine certificate. Upon checking in, air suvidha was required although info was not checked, vaccine certificate was scanned. I had already submitted my Covid test to air Canada while checking in online and so it was pre approved. Upon boarding, none of the suckers were requested.Here is the really surprising part: after landing in Delhi we were told by security present at the door to form a line and have our air suvidha and boarding pass ready. When I got to the front of the queue they only cared about the fact that you had a paper in your hand that resembled an air suvidha form. No information was checked or cross verified. In fact, the guy who was stamping my boarding pass did not even glance towards my air suvidha form once. After the boarding pass was stamped, none of the documents were required again. Overall I found the experience relatively easy and straightforward , it was probably more strict in Canada as the vaccine proof was requested two times in total and air suvidha once. In India only air suvidha was requested (but not checked). Also no one from my flight (as far as I can tell) was told to get tested again as part of that 2% group.

The difference between ARR and RRR is described very well [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2021/04/12/relative-vs-absolute-risk-reduction-500-doctors-want-to-know/). Both are valid metrics, and both need to be considered when looking at the efficacy of a new medicine or vaccine. However, RRR has the advantage of being independent of factors such as the age, gender or underlying medical conditions. As you pointed out, a 25 year old is at much less risk compared to a 65 yea old. But both enjoy the same RRR to any given vaccine.  Finally, in matters like this, we as individuals need to do a cost-benefit analysis. The vaccine is free in India and many other countries, so there is no monetary cost. You can walk into your nearest PHC with an ID card and get it. It has a tiny risk of causing blood clots (&lt;0.001%) and a much higher reduction in risk of dying from covid (0.13% by your calculations, for a healthy 25yo, and I feel that that is an underestimate).

Delhi handling the migration of other states workers)  * Govt. then poured money into research and development of vaccine and now we are so much capable that we are exporting medicines to 50+ countries.   * Govt. provided help in basic need of poor people who were totally dependent on God to save them. Gave them free and very cheap ration for months, gave money, motivated people in various ways.   * I don't say that only govt did this many organisations and peoples on their own did that but on the scale that it was i haven't seen that long line and satisfied people when they got free ration.   * Planning, managing and executing all this was done by govt and none of this is happened by जादू, various people in their field of expertise gave there everything to make this happen, some are no longer with us (ॐ शांति 🙏🏻)  Though govt collected funds but even then money was used by govt. own pocket.

He was not even due for the second dose with still several days remaining. The certificate shows that he was vaccinated at some Centre that they don't even know about and not even in their city.  When they angrily called the center, they didn't care.  There are thousands of people like that who had got vaccination messages despite not getting vaccination. So, essentially in order to inflate the numbers, they just marked a bunch of people as vaccinated without vaccinating them. No matter how good the system is, the CoWIN site is still in the hands of Infosys and they can pull up the database and mark anybody already in the system as fully vaccinated.  These are all people now who have a vaccination certificate showing that they were fully vaccinated but not really fully vaccinated. Unless they manage to register using a different mobile number, they cannot get vaccinated for the second dose.  In the past as well, there were numerous cases like this. Even if we ignore the dead people being vaccinated, live people being marked as vaccinated without vaccination is a serious issue. Just recently somebody created a post here about how a PHC marked them as vaccinated without giving them vaccination.  Looking from the perspective of a foreign country, tell me one good reason why they should trust India's vaccine certificate when the people who have it can be potentially unvaccinated.",india,t5_2qh1q,/r/india/comments/pt2ucu/problem_isnt_covishield_but_indias_vaccine/hdtqk4f/

They can pull up details of all people registered on a phone number and mark any of them as vaccinated. I also got vaccinated from my office. The process they did was to ask for phone number, check identity and mark us as vaccinated and then we proceed to get the injection. They didn't ask for the secret code. Same even for the drives that happened in our township premises.   I don't think this is some kind of coincidence that this happened on Modi's birthday when they were trying to create some sort of vaccination record. It has happened to people earlier as well whenever they were trying to set some record. But till now such instances were mostly concentrated in the BJP states which showed massive vaccination numbers.  Also, I talked to my cousin since posting and he apparently checked on CoWIN portal itself. He didn't get the message. He checked after coming to know that several people with upcoming due dates for second dose have had this happen to them.  I also doubt this was even done by any PHC.

147,147,113,0,1631438374,"&gt;Over 72 crore vaccine doses have been administered since the vaccination campaign against COVID-19 was flagged off on January 16 this year by Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. To provide a proof of vaccination for each of these individuals, Co-WIN is already issuing a digitally verifiable certificate. This certificate can be saved on a digital device (smartphone, tablet, laptop etc.) or stored in Digi Locker from where it can be digitally shared as and when required as a proof of vaccination. Similarly, at entry points where such certificate is required (e.g., in malls, office complex, public events etc.), it may be shown in both the digital and physical forms.   However, there may be instances where an entity does not need to see the certificate in full and would just need to know whether an individual has been vaccinated or not. A few of such possible use cases could be as follows:   An enterprise/employer may like to know the vaccination status of its employees to resume functions in offices, workplaces etc.   ii) The Railways may want to get the status of vaccination of the passengers who are getting their seats reserved in the trains.   iii) Airlines may want to get the status of vaccination of the passengers who are booking their flight tickets, and/or airports may only want to allow vaccinated passengers to pass through.   iv) Hotels may want to know the vaccination status of the residents at the time they are checking into the hotel, or at the time of making online bookings.   As the socio-economic activities are being gradually revived while maintaining everyone’s safety, there is a need for a way to digitally convey the status of individuals’ vaccination to entities with whom they may be engaging with for any or all reasons, as employees, passengers, residents etc.   Therefore, there is a need to enable an Aadhaar like authentication service for the status of vaccination through Co-WIN. To take care of these cases and others that may come up, Co-WIN has developed a new API called ‘Know Your Customer’s/Client’s Vaccination Status’ or KYC-VS. To use this API, an individual needs to enter his/her mobile number and name. Thereafter, they will get an OTP which they have to enter. In return, Co-WIN will send a response to the verifying entity on the individual’s status of vaccination, which will be as follows –   0 - Person is not vaccinated   1 - Person is partially vaccinated   2 - Person is fully vaccinated   This response will be digitally signed and can be shared instantly with the verifying entity. A real-life example could be when at the time of booking a railway ticket, an individual will input the necessary details for buying the ticket and if required, the concerned entity will also get the vaccination status in the same transaction, with the due consent of the individual.   KYC-VS will facilitate all such use cases and more. It is both consent-based and privacy preserving. Additionally, in order to facilitate quick integration and faster adoption, the Co-WIN Team has prepared a webpage with the API, which may be embedded in any system. This will allow for a seamless integration with any system in no time.   Besides the use cases pointed out, this service may be utilized by any service provider, private or public, for whom verifying an individual’s vaccination status is critical for facilitating a service requested.

194,194,160,0,1626242298,"There is a smidgen of truth in your points. However it is not enough to absolve the govt.   Yes the US and UK invested in the vaccine research, so they would always have a leg up. That's fine, but they didn't ask us to delay placing orders until Jan 2021, days before we began the vaccination campaign. Other countries had placed orders in the middle of last year.   Even when we did order, we ordered 14M doses, which is barely enough to vaccinate *Bangalore*, let alone the whole country.   And then there was the absolutely insane strategy of having three different types of buyers (union govt, state govts and private hospitals) face off against a duopoly of vaccine producers. In fact it was effectively a monopoly because covaxin production numbers are negligible compared to covishield. Any economist can tell you that a market where there's a monopoly against a fragmented group of buyers, heavily favors the monopolist. The govt created this monopoly/duopoly by allowing only two vaccines for several months. And this resulted in India paying more for vaccines than other countries that were importing the same vaccines from India. So far nobody has been able to explain the rationale behind creating this massively complex system.   Does this mean we wouldn't have problems if the govt had acted correctly? No. Vaccination across the world has faced challenges due to supply chain issues, embargoes and patent laws leading to vaccine apartheid. For these the western world can and should be held accountable. But the Indian govt made many unforced errors and persisted with them even when it was clear that their moves were having devastating consequences.

Thanks for putting it so succintly. And also thanks for not jumping at me, everybody is too busy with downvotes just because I asked a question. Although I guess someone might think I'm sealioning, and since this policy has resulted in so many deaths, I cant really complain.  From what I'm understanding, India allocated 35k crores for vaccine procurement. However it placed its orders too late(should have been placed \~aug 2020, but was placed in jan 2021), and that too a very negligibile amount of orders were placed. Just 16M doses amounting to \~600crore, which is a very tiny % of the 35000 crore alloted.  So that proves that India had the money to place orders, and thereby increase production of vaccines, but chose not to out of hubris. Shameful.

260,260,226,2,1621504610,"So yesterday afternoon I got my first dose of Covishield vaccine at one of the Apollo hospitals in Chennai. It was a relatively smooth process, and I will share the process in brief so that it can be helpful for you to plan for your vaccination:  (1) Booking vaccination appointment: Finding a slot &amp; booking on the Cowin portal is not an easy task. However, there are many apps/tools that can help in doing that &amp; I used the Paytm app - Vaccine Finder tool to search for available slots in Chennai. If you are unable to find a slot, don't worry - the Paytm tool has a very useful option for sending us Notifications whenever slots are opened. For that, you need to keep the Paytm app minimised/put in the background of your smartphone. Then, whenever slots are opened, you will get a Notification mentioning the hospital name, pincode &amp; no. of slots available. Then, immediately open the Paytm tool through which you can login to the Cowin portal &amp; check the slots which have become available &amp; book your appointment. Please note that this process needs to be done very rapidly, like even a few seconds delay can cause you to miss the booking! Think of like Tatkal booking, but 10x more difficult!!! After trying for three days continuously, finally I managed to book a slot by sheer luck!  (2) Preparing for the appointment: Once appointment is booked, please download the PDF confirmation of the same on your mobile phone. If possible, better take a printout &amp; carry it with you. Also, please ensure to take your Aadhar Card original with you to the Hospital (AADHAR CARD IS COMPULSORY. If you don't bring it, they will refuse to vaccinate you) &amp; also take a pen and notebook as you may have to fill out some forms at the Hospital.  (3) Travel to the vaccination center: This is a bit of a hassle now, as Chennai police are enforcing strict lockdown, they are not allowing two-wheelers or autos to travel from one locality to another. There are barricades at all road junctions &amp; police are stopping all vehicles and asking questions. However, if you have a personal car or booked an Uber/Ola cab to go to the Hospital, then the police won't bother you. Please be ready to show your appointment PDF document or printout whenever they ask. I personally was questioned at two junctions &amp; after I showed my printout &amp; Aadhar Card, they allowed me to proceed.  (4) At the hospital - initial formalities: Upon reaching the Hospital, I was asked to fill out a form with my personal details as well as Aadhar number &amp; Appointment code. We were asked to wait outside in a covered Parking Lot with seats sufficiently spaced out from each other to ensure social distancing. There were around 20-25 people seated there &amp; mask wearing was strictly enforced by the security. They called 10 people at a time to enter the hospital, did temperature checks &amp; offered sanitizer to clean our hands before entering. Once entered, we had to go to the billing counter where they checked my documents, asked me if I have any cold/fever/any comorbidities &amp; since I didn't have any, they asked me to proceed with making the payment of Rs. 850/- (as right now Apollo are offering only Paid Covishield vaccine for 18-45 age group). Then we were asked to wait inside. This entire waiting &amp; formalities process took around 30-40 mins.  (5) Vaccine injection: A few mins after being seated, I was called inside a room to take the vaccine injection. They showed me the Covishield vaccine vial &amp; injected the vaccine as a single syringe shot in my left arm (similar to a Tetanus injection). Afterwards, I was told be seated in another waiting room for 20 mins just to observe if I get any adverse reactions to the vaccine dose.  (6) Completion of formalities: While waiting inside the room, within 5-10 mins, I got an SMS confirmation reg the vaccine 1st dose I had taken &amp; it gave me a link to open/download the Vaccination Certificate PDF &amp; I was able to download it easily. Once the 20 mins waiting time was over, I left the Hospital to head back home.  (7) Travel back to home: While returning back home, as usual police checking at each road junction, but no issues &amp; I was able to reach home easily. I didn't get any tiredness or sickness that we were warned about getting after taking vaccine shot, so it was good.  (8) Post vaccine illness/symptoms: I luckily didn't get any major symptoms like fever or body pain, but at night I did feel little tired &amp; with slight headache. However since today morning I am feeling fine &amp; normal. So far so good.  That was my experience with getting 1st dose of Covishield vaccine in Chennai. Hope it was helpful &amp; please let me know if you have any questions.",india,t5_2qh1q,/r/india/comments/n1plmu/coronavirus_covid19_discussion_megathread_9/gysz20d/

265,265,231,1,1621366473,"Good news, bad news for the three of you - /u/homosapien2014 , /u/Assasin-ed and /u/corporatededmeat. I'm currently sitting at home riding out a sick day from my vaccine shot and since my work has a strict 'No disturbance during a sick day' policy, I have some time to recover, think about what you've mentioned and document it all here, so enjoy.   Let's start with some general notes:   a) **This is strictly about finances.** How your educational and other factors really help to determine eligibility overall, but those can be worked on too.   b) **Assumptions.** I'm assuming in this case that both of you have at least a Bachelors' degree (quite possible) and are (likely) unmarried, given your ages.   c) **Canada as Frame of Reference:** I will be using Canada as a frame of reference for discussions, but you can do your research on other immigration programs to chart out what it would be for other countries - Aus/NZ/EU, etc.   d) **Timelines:** Your move to said country will not be immediate - you need to think long term and your long-term planning needs to be sound because it's not something you can action immediately. You need to do the groundwork, plan and prepare. So if you're thinking about going tomorrow, or next year - stop. What I'm going to talk about below is basically what you need to build towards to breeze through it when you're ready so as soon as the final step is in place, you're a go.   e) **CRS Scores:** When I qualified for the program, I scored a rather high CRS score of 481 which allowed me to move quickly. [Here's a breakdown of my score.](https://i.imgur.com/GDhPLBt.png) But I had something that (I'm assuming) you don't, which was a Masters degree that gave me some more points in the CRS score. For a considerable chunk of points, you should be looking at the following:   i) Under 30 years of age (ideally, unmarried gives you better points than married does, but more on that later)   ii) At least 2 - 3 years of work experience under the NOC code you're applying under  iii) High IELTS General scores - we're talking 8.0 and above on every section, no exceptions  iv) Something that's equivalent to a Bachelor's degree, as per WES. They have an estimator on their website. Obviously, if you have a Master's degree and it is Ontario-equivalent, nothing like it!  [You can find out your current CRS scores here.](https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp)   Now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about specifics:  #Age  **All of you have an advantage here. You're young!** I first thought about moving when I was 28 - I landed in Canada in a month after I turned 30. A lot of the available programs for now really start to penalize you for age after 30, so you all should score high marks in this sector. Additionally, the later you move, the harder it could be to adapt because there's good chance you'll need to start your working life in Canada a rung or two below the position you had in India.   #Current Savings  Before we begin, let's work on trying to build up a 'shopping list' of items that are going to be a part of this adventure:   1. [Proof of Funds](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/proof-funds.html): This is what the government asks you to show that you'll be able to support yourself in your new life in Canada. This is a sliding scale that depends on the number of applicants in your application. In case you do plan to get married between now and then, see one of the sections below about it. Assuming 1 person, for now, the current amount is CAD 12,960 (with today's current forex because of the abnormally high CAD atm, is around INR 7,85,394.92 as of writing this, so around 8 lakhs.)  2. [PR Application fees:](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/apply-permanent-residence.html) CAD 1,325 or INR 80,288.37 , or around 80.5k INR  3. [WES Certification of your degree to show its equivalency to a Canadian bachelors:](https://www.wes.org/ca/evaluations-and-fees/eca/) 220 CAD, or INR 13330.90, so around 13.5k INR  4. [IELTS General Test](https://www.britishcouncil.in/exam/ielts/dates-fees-locations) INR 14,700  5. [India PCC Application](https://www.passportindia.gov.in/AppOnlineProject/fee/feeInput): You'd need to get this done at some point towards the middle of the process. Costs INR 500  6. [PR Medical Expenses](https://www.lilavatihospital.com/Visa-Investigation): Costs associated with doing your medicals for the PR process towards the end of the process itself. Typically costs around  5,000 - 9,000 INR. I got mine done at Lilavati back in 2016, and it was around 7,000 INR.   Those are what I'd call 'The big 6' costs, of which the 'Proof of Funds' isn't even really a cost at all; they're literally showing your savings that you intend to use when you land in Canada. You only need to show you have this and that it's not with any strings attached and you're in the clear.   ***So, with the five real costs outlined, you're looking at a final total of 1,15,819.27, aka 1.15 lakh INR. So with your Proof of Funds, that's about 9.15 lakhs at a minimum.***  Now, there could be other miscellaneous items associated with this too:  a) If you lived in any country other than India (whose cost was already mentioned above) for longer than 6 months within the past 10 years before you plan to apply, you gotta produce a Police Clearance Certificate for each country. That cost can vary depending on the country but it's not terribly expensive relative to the other options outlined above.  b) Married at the point of application? Effectively double some of those expenses, because there are two of you.  c) Training material for IELTS, courier costs...this is going to depend on how you approach it.     Now, to come to specifics on this:   **/u/homosapien2014 :**   You stated 6L as your savings and 13L as your earning capacity for now, you're sitting pretty. You're already about 60% away from the target you need to hit financially.   **/u/Assasin-ed :**   You stated 50k. I wouldn't say you're in bad shape per se, you're also young and my earnings as an artist back then were similar to yours so I can relate.   Having said that, you have ways to go on that front, but again, it's not impossible. Something that nobody tells you is that your family and friends have the ability to 'gift deed' you the balance amount as a way of raising your Proof of Funds. I'm not going to comment on whether that's a possibility in your situation, but I wanted to put it out there as a valid option for you to pursue. I know someone who did that; their dad gave them 5 Lakhs as a gift deed and when he came to Canada and settled in, he earned that money back in short order and gifted it back to his father and bought them a car as a way of saying thank you. 'Nary a dry eye in the audience, etc.   Additionally, like I said before - you're young, your earning capacity can grow and you need to focus on saving. You have a runway of at least 5 years to get the above together.   **/u/corporatededmeat :**   You stated 10L (*Sirf dal kha rahe ho kya, bc?* I didn't have nearly that much in savings when I was 24, lol :D)  Good news for you too, you're already there savings-wise, savings wise but you should add some more and get to work on that work experience, seeing as you're a fresh grad.   **Now, the million-dollar question - what do you need to do to prepare?**  1. Sit down, pen and paper out timelines. Look up the pre-requisites like I mentioned above.   2. Use the first free consultations of a few migration consultants (except Y-Axis, they're *chors*) to get a sense of if you're on the right track. I did this and I found that they were useful and going to them prepared also allows you to see right through their bullshit because often they'll have their own racket going on. Had one of those nitwits tell me my WES ECA was 'wrong' so they'd need to order a fresh one for me. He can suck it, I made it through just fine so he was full of shit and wanted to pocket some extra money because he quoted double what the WES site was actually charging.   3. For things you're not certain about, go [here](https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-discussion-board/) - This is the one source of truth for anything you need to know about Canadian immigration, for example. There will likely be similar communities on Facebook or the internet for the chosen country you want to go to.   4. Set up goals - set up a financial account for immigration money, send your savings there, take stock of how much you've reached for Proof of Funds and for the big 6 expenses. Keep a regular track of this and keep an ear to the rails if something changes so you can modify the plan accordingly. Similar, set milestone dates for when you should start work on getting some stuff done - I can tell you right now that getting the WES is a painful experience because it depends on your university giving a specific document and either mailing directly to them (you know what grade A *chutiyas* Indian colleges are so good luck lol) or giving you a sealed, stamped envelop with the transcripts that you mail to WES for approval.   5. Start digitizing your documents, like... ALL your documents. From your birth certificate to your passport, start scanning and saving two versions of it. A high quality, high file size 'Original Master' and a compressed low-quality version. You'll need to refer to this a lot when you apply. Pay stubs, income tax filing, bank statements, everything. Download and store everything, set up reminders to download this stuff online or go into your bank branch and have them give you everything signed and stamped for your accounts and keep it. You're going to be likely printing out enough paperwork for the application to massacre a small forest, so best be prepared for it ahead of time.",india,t5_2qh1q,/r/india/comments/nezsm0/emigrate_used_to_be_a_meme_on_rindia_i_cannot/gylvdxv/

The Brazilian government signed a contract last month to buy 20 million doses of the Indian drugmaker's vaccine. Bharat Biotech applied for emergency use of the vaccine in Brazil on March 8.    &gt;   &gt;Bharat and its Brazilian partner Precisa Medicamentos said in a statement that they would appeal the decision and would present evidence that it is complying with all requirements.   &gt;   &gt;Covaxin has been approved for use in five countries, including India, the statement said.

According to the regulator, these issues could potentially risk the quality of the vaccine, and the action plan it sent was not sufficient to mitigate the risks.  &gt; “The requirements pointed out during inspection will be fulfilled, the timelines for fulfillment is under discussion with the Brazil NRA and will be resolved soon,” stated Bharat Biotech in response to the issue.  &gt; According to ANVISA’s statement on its decision, different non-conformities were found at Bharat Biotech’s manufacturing site that denote a significant risk to the manufacture and product quality assurance. This, in turn, implies a health risk for users of the vaccine in Brazil, according to the regulator.  &gt; **Major issues flagged include safety-related observations that the company had not validated the method of analysis to prove complete inactivation of the virus (to prove that it was killed). According to ANVISA, considering that Covaxin is an inactivated vaccine, the company needs to ensure that the virus was completely inactivated, otherwise live SARS-CoV-2 viruses may be present in the vaccine.**  &gt; The regulator also felt that the **company was not taking all the necessary precautions to guarantee the product’s sterility and a lack of adequate control strategies to guarantee the vaccine’s purity.**  &gt; Other observations were that **the company does not use a specific control method to quantify the antigen content and potency of the vaccine** . The vaccine may have **variations in antigen content and consequently compromise its effectiveness** , according to the regulator.  &gt; Precisa Medicamentos **presented an action plan on March 17** to resolve these issues, but the **measures effectively adopted so far have not been sufficient to mitigate the risks associated with the non conformities indicated** , according to ANVISA.  &gt; “If ANVISA has inspected this facility and found it not meeting its standards, it has options to say it will never buy this product or to ask the company to make corrections so that it can take a call after another inspection,” said vaccine expert Dr Gagandeep Kang, Professor, Christian Medical College-Vellore.  &gt; “The company should take it very seriously and our regulator should take it very seriously, and either do an independent inspection and confirm whether there really is a problem that needs to be corrected or push back,” she added.

351,351,32,0,1621366473,"Good news, bad news for the three of you - /u/homosapien2014 , /u/Assasin-ed and /u/corporatededmeat. I'm currently sitting at home riding out a sick day from my vaccine shot and since my work has a strict 'No disturbance during a sick day' policy, I have some time to recover, think about what you've mentioned and document it all here, so enjoy.   Let's start with some general notes:   a) **This is strictly about finances.** How your educational and other factors really help to determine eligibility overall, but those can be worked on too.   b) **Assumptions.** I'm assuming in this case that both of you have at least a Bachelors' degree (quite possible) and are (likely) unmarried, given your ages.   c) **Canada as Frame of Reference:** I will be using Canada as a frame of reference for discussions, but you can do your research on other immigration programs to chart out what it would be for other countries - Aus/NZ/EU, etc.   d) **Timelines:** Your move to said country will not be immediate - you need to think long term and your long-term planning needs to be sound because it's not something you can action immediately. You need to do the groundwork, plan and prepare. So if you're thinking about going tomorrow, or next year - stop. What I'm going to talk about below is basically what you need to build towards to breeze through it when you're ready so as soon as the final step is in place, you're a go.   e) **CRS Scores:** When I qualified for the program, I scored a rather high CRS score of 481 which allowed me to move quickly. [Here's a breakdown of my score.](https://i.imgur.com/GDhPLBt.png) But I had something that (I'm assuming) you don't, which was a Masters degree that gave me some more points in the CRS score. For a considerable chunk of points, you should be looking at the following:   i) Under 30 years of age (ideally, unmarried gives you better points than married does, but more on that later)   ii) At least 2 - 3 years of work experience under the NOC code you're applying under  iii) High IELTS General scores - we're talking 8.0 and above on every section, no exceptions  iv) Something that's equivalent to a Bachelor's degree, as per WES. They have an estimator on their website. Obviously, if you have a Master's degree and it is Ontario-equivalent, nothing like it!  [You can find out your current CRS scores here.](https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp)   Now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about specifics:  #Age  **All of you have an advantage here. You're young!** I first thought about moving when I was 28 - I landed in Canada in a month after I turned 30. A lot of the available programs for now really start to penalize you for age after 30, so you all should score high marks in this sector. Additionally, the later you move, the harder it could be to adapt because there's good chance you'll need to start your working life in Canada a rung or two below the position you had in India.   #Current Savings  Before we begin, let's work on trying to build up a 'shopping list' of items that are going to be a part of this adventure:   1. [Proof of Funds](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/proof-funds.html): This is what the government asks you to show that you'll be able to support yourself in your new life in Canada. This is a sliding scale that depends on the number of applicants in your application. In case you do plan to get married between now and then, see one of the sections below about it. Assuming 1 person, for now, the current amount is CAD 12,960 (with today's current forex because of the abnormally high CAD atm, is around INR 7,85,394.92 as of writing this, so around 8 lakhs.)  2. [PR Application fees:](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/apply-permanent-residence.html) CAD 1,325 or INR 80,288.37 , or around 80.5k INR  3. [WES Certification of your degree to show its equivalency to a Canadian bachelors:](https://www.wes.org/ca/evaluations-and-fees/eca/) 220 CAD, or INR 13330.90, so around 13.5k INR  4. [IELTS General Test](https://www.britishcouncil.in/exam/ielts/dates-fees-locations) INR 14,700  5. [India PCC Application](https://www.passportindia.gov.in/AppOnlineProject/fee/feeInput): You'd need to get this done at some point towards the middle of the process. Costs INR 500  6. [PR Medical Expenses](https://www.lilavatihospital.com/Visa-Investigation): Costs associated with doing your medicals for the PR process towards the end of the process itself. Typically costs around  5,000 - 9,000 INR. I got mine done at Lilavati back in 2016, and it was around 7,000 INR.   Those are what I'd call 'The big 6' costs, of which the 'Proof of Funds' isn't even really a cost at all; they're literally showing your savings that you intend to use when you land in Canada. You only need to show you have this and that it's not with any strings attached and you're in the clear.   ***So, with the five real costs outlined, you're looking at a final total of 1,15,819.27, aka 1.15 lakh INR. So with your Proof of Funds, that's about 9.15 lakhs at a minimum.***  Now, there could be other miscellaneous items associated with this too:  a) If you lived in any country other than India (whose cost was already mentioned above) for longer than 6 months within the past 10 years before you plan to apply, you gotta produce a Police Clearance Certificate for each country. That cost can vary depending on the country but it's not terribly expensive relative to the other options outlined above.  b) Married at the point of application? Effectively double some of those expenses, because there are two of you.  c) Training material for IELTS, courier costs...this is going to depend on how you approach it.     Now, to come to specifics on this:   **/u/homosapien2014 :**   You stated 6L as your savings and 13L as your earning capacity for now, you're sitting pretty. You're already about 60% away from the target you need to hit financially.   **/u/Assasin-ed :**   You stated 50k. I wouldn't say you're in bad shape per se, you're also young and my earnings as an artist back then were similar to yours so I can relate.   Having said that, you have ways to go on that front, but again, it's not impossible. Something that nobody tells you is that your family and friends have the ability to 'gift deed' you the balance amount as a way of raising your Proof of Funds. I'm not going to comment on whether that's a possibility in your situation, but I wanted to put it out there as a valid option for you to pursue. I know someone who did that; their dad gave them 5 Lakhs as a gift deed and when he came to Canada and settled in, he earned that money back in short order and gifted it back to his father and bought them a car as a way of saying thank you. 'Nary a dry eye in the audience, etc.   Additionally, like I said before - you're young, your earning capacity can grow and you need to focus on saving. You have a runway of at least 5 years to get the above together.   **/u/corporatededmeat :**   You stated 10L (*Sirf dal kha rahe ho kya, bc?* I didn't have nearly that much in savings when I was 24, lol :D)  Good news for you too, you're already there savings-wise, savings wise but you should add some more and get to work on that work experience, seeing as you're a fresh grad.   **Now, the million-dollar question - what do you need to do to prepare?**  1. Sit down, pen and paper out timelines. Look up the pre-requisites like I mentioned above.   2. Use the first free consultations of a few migration consultants (except Y-Axis, they're *chors*) to get a sense of if you're on the right track. I did this and I found that they were useful and going to them prepared also allows you to see right through their bullshit because often they'll have their own racket going on. Had one of those nitwits tell me my WES ECA was 'wrong' so they'd need to order a fresh one for me. He can suck it, I made it through just fine so he was full of shit and wanted to pocket some extra money because he quoted double what the WES site was actually charging.   3. For things you're not certain about, go [here](https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-discussion-board/) - This is the one source of truth for anything you need to know about Canadian immigration, for example. There will likely be similar communities on Facebook or the internet for the chosen country you want to go to.   4. Set up goals - set up a financial account for immigration money, send your savings there, take stock of how much you've reached for Proof of Funds and for the big 6 expenses. Keep a regular track of this and keep an ear to the rails if something changes so you can modify the plan accordingly. Similar, set milestone dates for when you should start work on getting some stuff done - I can tell you right now that getting the WES is a painful experience because it depends on your university giving a specific document and either mailing directly to them (you know what grade A *chutiyas* Indian colleges are so good luck lol) or giving you a sealed, stamped envelop with the transcripts that you mail to WES for approval.   5. Start digitizing your documents, like... ALL your documents. From your birth certificate to your passport, start scanning and saving two versions of it. A high quality, high file size 'Original Master' and a compressed low-quality version. You'll need to refer to this a lot when you apply. Pay stubs, income tax filing, bank statements, everything. Download and store everything, set up reminders to download this stuff online or go into your bank branch and have them give you everything signed and stamped for your accounts and keep it. You're going to be likely printing out enough paperwork for the application to massacre a small forest, so best be prepared for it ahead of time.",india,t5_2qh1q,/r/india/comments/nezsm0/emigrate_used_to_be_a_meme_on_rindia_i_cannot/gylvdxv/

Yes, there’s practically no travel between India and Pakistan but I was in Dubai back at end of April when things were getting out of hand in India, When I was flying back to Pakistan via the Fly Dubai terminal, hundreds of Indians and Pakistanis were seated together awaiting their respective flights and interacting with each other. If people aren’t taking our COVID numbers seriously, it’s because our government lacks credibility around the world not because it’s some ploy to ostracize us.   Ukraine is notorious for treating Pakistanis with a lot of contempt upon arrival because several Pakistanis who travel there only do so they can flee in to one of the bordering countries.   I was supposed to visit Russia this summer to attend a Euro cup game. Had my ticket and everything lined up. Was super excited. Guess what ? I didn’t end up going because a lot of people flying in from Pakistan ended up getting detained and being sent back. Among these were 18 or 19 year olds who had shown up with a mere hundred dollars on them not thinking they’d be vetted by immigration. What was their real purpose of travel ? The airline I was traveling with announce they weren’t to going to fly people to Russia traveling on the basis of Fan ID.

Don't stress about ""prestige,"" it's not Oxbridge or Ivy (which aren't special anyway, I have multiple colleagues from there and it didn't help them any more than me!)  2) Research point is fairly valid, however, you can always apply to do research after undergrad (and research degrees generally pay you to do them). I can personally confirm that I've seen multiple researchers from no-name universities, everywhere.  3) I don't have ADHD but I've lived in Europe and the medical care is quite good, albeit, most countries are similar (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, etc.) This is important when making a decision on where to study because all these places offer those benefits too.  4) True, you can provide a comfortable living for them doing just about anything abroad though. Medicine is expensive and takes quite a long time (you'll need to fund yourself until the $$$ rolls in).  5) A Pakistani passport isn't a burden, I've actively tried to keep mine because this passport is a part of my identity. You bite the hand that feeds you?  6) While it's good to be ambitious, Pakistan doesn't particularly need doctors more than, let's say, water security or agriculture workers.  My point being, you weren't born in South Sudan, we have fantastic universities in Pakistan that offer a wide range of degrees (many of which, lead people abroad anyway).

And now the mayors want the unvaccinated banned from going to restaurants, malls, groceries. I'm pretty sure those who did not get the boosters will be considered ""unvaccinated"" in the future. Fck Isko moreno and all these mayors.  I didnt get the vaccination because i already had covid back in March of 2021. There's this thing called ""natural immunity"". It was unneccessary for me to get the jab, and i never had the virus again after getting sick with it. But I finally decided to get the vaccine after they announced a ""lockdown for the unvaccinated"".   But this vaccine mandate/passport that the govt officials are forcing upon us is too much. This will backfire bigly for those (isko moreno) who favored this and this will wreck our economy for sure. Booster shots 3 to 4 times a year for new variants, long lines at the crack of dawn, businesses having only half the customers it usually gets because of the mandates, good luck with that.

395,7,7,0,1640330678,"Probably Manuel Quezon. He laid the foundation of our country.   He approved Filipino as the national language, Created national council of education which advices the government on educational policies and reforms and to upgrade public schools all across philippines.   He initiated the womens suffrage (Made it possible for women to vote).  He established the Department of National Defense.  He created Agriculture and Commerce (Which later became Department of Agriculture)  He reorganized/Created Health and Public welfare (DOH) and tackled Tuberculosis, Malaria, Malnutrition, Leprosy etc.   He appointed first all filipino Supreme Court in 1935.   He fought for the passage of the Tydings-McDuffie Act. (Philippine Independence)   Not including his works on improving bureaucracy, Mindanao development, Foreign trade and commerce, and Corruption reforms  He did all of that while USA is grabbing the country by the balls. And not to mention the invasion of Japanese.   For me He is the best president of the Philippines.    2. Sergio Osmeña Sr.   Rebuilt Post-War Philippines, Bell trade act. Considering the country was practically fucked and on fire at the time, He contributed a lot to rebuilding it.   3. Ramon Magsaysay    Defeated Hukbalahap, Made our country a member of Southeast asia treaty organization (Asean), Made NARRA, Philippines was at a golden age where corruption is not rampant.   4. Carlos P. Garcia for his cultural revival and filipino muna policy.   5. Diosdado Macapagal   Placed the Philippine Peso on the free currency exchange and pushed for exports, Minimum wage law, Philippines veterans bank, Land reform Law.  Basically Economy fixing.   6. Elpidio Quirino   National Security Council, created integrity board. notable postwar reconstruction, general economic gains and increased economic aid from the United States and Social Security services (SSS)    6. Jose Laurel   He did the best he could do during the Japanese occupation. Contributions to educational reforms and a true advocate for Justice. He was involved in making the constitution which included the Bill of Rights of the 1935 Constitution, which was the so-called Seven Wise Men of the Convention. He was the senator of the Third Republic and the author of Rizal Law, and at the same time was the negotiator of the Laurel –Langley Trade agreement.   7. Manuel Roxas   Bell trade act (Exports are Tariff free) and the push for Tydinfs-Mcduffie act. And basically national reconstruction post war.   8. Fidel V. Ramos  He was alright. He did what he could during post marcos fuckery. His policies alleviated the drowning economy. And the implementation of comprehensive social reform agenda. Reached out for peace talks with muslim insurgents and NPA. MRT line 3 and LRT line 2.  Best dude to have at one of the shittiest time.   9. Benigno Aquino III  K to 12 program, Economic Growth, gave insensitive for BPO companies which created thousands of Jobs for undergraduate Filipino, Hague Ruling against China (A Bold fucking move, Too bad Obama is a fucking asshole) peace agreement with MILF.   11. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo  A classic case of ""You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain""  Her works as a Senator was fucking outstanding. Too bad she went corrupt.   She's an Economist and a good one at that. Initiated the Strong republic transit system. Pulled out of Iraq after the kidnapping of filipino truck driver. She was criticized but she did the right thing.   Philippines-Japan trade deal.   But the bitch went coo coo. Corruptions here. Corruptions there. Controversy here. Controversy there.   Its too bad. Shes a wasted potential.   12. Cory Aquino  1987 constitution.   Honestly I dont know much about her presidency but I do know it wasn't that good. She did the best she could when the economy is so fucked thanks to one fucking Ube looking motherfucker.   She alleviate the fucked economy I guess and strengthen international bonds.   13. Rodrigo Duterte  I like his works on infrastructure. Increasing salary of military and police. Passport act. Strengthen the Anti deposit law.  New clark city, major rehabilitation of Boracay and Cleaning of Manila bay (Didn't like the dolomite beach) excited for the subway system.   He made significant improvements on crimes but this time the policemen became the criminal. Controversy here, controversy there. Murder here, murder there.   And his covid 19 pandemic handling is..... Very fucking underwhelming. Roque, Duque and the fucking pardoning of Pemberton. That was fucking disgusting.   Not to mention his foreign policy on china. What a shit show.   His works on infrastructure is fucking good. But everything else is golden dogshit.   14. Emilio Aguinaldo   He is busy dealing with Spaniards and Americans that he didnt really do anything significant. He fought for our independence I guess.   15. Ferdinand Marcos  Same as Duterte. Good on infrastructure and shit on everything else. I fucking hate this man. When i look at my taxes I am very fucking angered that I am paying for Imelda's shoes collection.   He fucked the economy of our nation and I can't believe people still thinks this dick is the best one. Quezon must be so fucking disappointed.   Overall a shit president.

You can teach in universities without a LET as long as you have qualifying experience and post graduate degrees (I know, I teach in one). Similarly, private school teaching for high school also doesn't require LET (I taught for senior high as well, part-time).  If you want to teach in public schools, you need to pass the licensure exam. However, prep yourself for low pay and poor benefits. Add to that, the teaching ratio is usually one teacher to 60 students. Materials are incomplete, with no books, chairs, or other stuff. Most of the time, you have to prep out of pocket.  Prepare yourself for a major downgrade teaching in the Philippines. Even in the private schools were I taught, they had inadequate tech facilities (everyone had to compete for one projector, boom box, etc.) and even the rest rooms are crappy. Don't expect anything like the USA where you are given supplies. You will bear the cost of it all!  And if you do decide to come here, pls get yourself extensive health insurance coverage.

425,37,37,0,1626080425,"The EU's ""Digital COVID Certificate"", which is colloquially referred to as the EU's ""vaccine passport"" is a one-pager document that's supposed to make it easy for people to travel through and across the Schengen region by having a singularly-recognized, uniform declaration of a person's vaccination status.  It's this thing that supposedly only recognizes Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and AstraZeneca (specifically, the Western-manufactured version of AZ, and not the licensed versions of AZ from India, South Korea, or Thailand).  The ""rumor"" about Sinovac (and other vaccines) is based on how the Digital COVID Certificate has not yet been uniformly implemented across all EU countries, and __the EU has given its member states individual discretion on recognizing/allowing vaccines that the European Medicines Agency has not yet approved__.  For example: https://www.dw.com/en/which-eu-countries-accept-vaccinated-travelers/a-57808870  &gt; **People entering Spain** from what it deems ""risk"" areas — including many EU members and most other countries in the world — **can avoid quarantine requirements by showing proof of full vaccination with a jab approved by** the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or **the World Health Organization (WHO) at least 14 days before arriving**, proof of recovery from COVID-19, or a negative test.  [and noting here that Sinovac is included within this classification of vaccines approved by the WHO, even if it is not (yet) approved by the EMA]  &gt; **The Greek government** lists the following vaccines among those accepted: Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax, Johnson and Johnson, **Sinovac**, Sputnik V, Casino Biologics, and Sinopharm.  In contrast:  &gt; France recognizes all vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency and considers travelers fully vaccinated two weeks after their final dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or AstraZeneca jabs, and four weeks after the single shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.  So given that France specifically does not recognize vaccines that are (only) approved by the WHO, and also does not specifically name Sinovac, then presumably a person vaccinated with Sinovac might not be able to enter France (without an urgent need/without undergoing quarantine), even if they might be able to enter Greece or Spain.  Or as another example:  &gt; However, fully vaccinated passengers with valid vaccination certificates are entirely exempt, no matter the color code of the country they come from. **Cyprus accepts all vaccines approved for use in the EU as well as the Sputnik V and Sinopharm shots**.  This means that Sino**vac** specifically would not count for Cyprus, even if Sino**pharm** does.  If you actually were going to plan a trip to Europe, and you were vaccinated with Sinovac (or Sinopharm, as in the case of the San Juan), you'd basically have to check on a per-country basis.

I have no family or friends in the USA - This is NOT an exaggeration. I could get an apartment, but I just feel it would be pointless unless it's required for a passport - read below about that.  You choose to be homeless. That is your fault. You failed. How does one not have friends or family? Sounds like you have anti-societal problems. You failed.   &gt;I would like to travel to Philippines. I seem to like the people there more. They don't seem to have as much drugs or alcohol or smoking or random sex or vulgarity as much as America. I hate the USA because everyone I meet does ""Weed"", gets drunk and high, or smokes, takes pride in having sex with random people, have immense ego and entitlement, employees give the worst and unprofessional experience,band I just don't like people in the USA.  You know nothing about the PHILIPPINES probably other than Filipinas who will love you long time. Stop reading those SEX PAT blogs.   DRUGS are prevalent in the PHILIPPINES also and nothing more different than the States. If you tried to make some minimal effort, you can read about all the drug-related news. Like drinking doesn't exist here? It does. Everything you hate in the States exists in the PHILIPPINES as well. Think of the Philippines as little America. Your ideas of paradise is incorrect and your sources are wrong.   The people you despise there is your fault b/c you choose to not associate with other people in the States. These people you despise also exist here in the PHILIPPINES.   &gt;I also like how people in Philippines seems to be nice, respectful, Family Oriented, and dress with dignity in a professional manner.  Yes but not for you. Chances are if you dont like people in the states and you feel like everyone has done you wrong it will be more prevalent here especially when you dont know the language.   &gt;I don't have a Passport yet. I have all the documents needed to get a passport but it would be for my old address that I no longer live at. I have already checked and know I can get one with the documents I have... But I don't know if that would be an issue because a passport last for many years, and I won't always be able to verify an old address I don't live at anymore...  BOOHOO. Cry me a river. If you had a permanent home then this wouldn't be an issue. Again that's your fault for living out of a car.   &gt;I don't have the Covid Vaccine because I think Covid is a overhyped propaganda piece, but I would be willing to get a vaccine to travel, otherwise I won't in America. I'll even wear a mask as mandatory even though I never wear one in the USA.  See previous post, but you are a COVID denier. You drank the q-anon Trump koolaid. This in itself speaks how stupid you and your kind are. COVID is real and i hope you get COVID so it proves how wrong you are.    &gt;I know the USA has a lot of Freedom and Money but I don't like the people here. They have taken that Freedom and act like brats and taken the Money and act entitled.  Again. you are one of those trumpers who think all your freedoms are taken away...life's not fair. Waaah waaah. You will have less freedoms in the PHILIPPINES as a foreigner.    &gt;Because I do NOT know: What are important laws or customs I will have to abide by in Philippines?  A simple search online will do. No one's going to spoon feed you.   &gt;I also don't know if there are any specific requirements needed like additional vaccination for other things or if the address on the passport has to be my new apartment if I get one.  So you are willing to bend the rules travel? Either you are anti-vax or willing to vax? Pick a side.   &gt;If I have to have a new address: How can I choose an apartment or a home that will allow a foreigner if I ever decide to bring someone to America to get married?  Again see previous posts. You are a prime target to be taken advantage of.    &gt;Is there any advice you can provide me?  Yes DO NOT GO. You are a loser in the states and you will be a loser here.

Roundtrip economy fares from Manila to Europe are around $800 (pre-COVID), visa fees around $100, travel insurance around $30, traveler’s tax around $35, pocket money and accommodations depends on the lifestyle, of course, but some travel blogs will give your friend a rough idea of how much the consulate is expecting to see in your friend’s bank account to supplement his/her travel. While I can sense your excitement in hosting your friend, that’s easily $1000 at least, and only she can say whether she can actually afford that.   If your friend has traveled to other places (not a blank passport), or has visas (expired or current) to the US, Japan, Canada, etc. that will help a lot.  Aside from the documents listed in the checklist, I’d also recommend your friend to provide an employment certificate from his/her employer and a letter granting him/her leave of absence, both good to have onhand if the consulate asks. It’s a great way to prove that she has a job to come back to especially if she’s been working in that company for quite some time now, and shows that she has her employer’s consent for her vacation. Best to travel with these documents as proof too, just in case Immigration asks.   Before the appointment itself, ask your friend to rehearse and make sure that he/she knows how to answer politely and succinctly. Common questions are “How long will you be staying?” and “Purpose of travel?” but it’s not unheard of for them to ask “Are you paying for your own trip? Who is helping you pay? What is your relationship? Are you going to work there? Why is your employer allowing you to go on a break this long?”  It’s better to overprepare than to underprepare. Have photocopies of everything, bring a pen and glue, get there on time, and be polite to EVERYONE. Only answer when prompted. Do not overshare because that will only lead to more questions.   In some cases, they may grant a visa but also indicate via stamp that you will have to go back to the local consulate office once you return from your trip just to make sure that you actually returned from the trip. It’s not a big deal; just show up and get stamped.

Not that I was going broke, but i would always spend only what I have extra, after all essentials are covered.  this was a menage-atrois  a milestone for me.  turns out ""friend"" was unremarkable, morena, but no skills, the experience forgettable, and of course I wore protection, i did her friend first, Krista being a non participant, after were done doing it once, friend says she has to go, perhaps she was just in need.  so Krista and I just spent the afternoon, much like we did before.   *****  for the life of me, I never kept numbers written down, I lost my phone, i dont even remember how or what phone was it, I never had contact with Krista again, Facebook was just rising back then, and free data was not even something, people still have to rent PCs just to check their accounts.   but the website was still there.   4. ""Abby""  ""Abby"", if you being a patron of the same website, would know her, her 'alias' was not even a made up one. And how can you not forget?  A petite, 4'11 or 5'1 ish girl with 40Ds  i even find it too good to be true in the pictures, even before when I hear the doorbell rang, I was already excited I can hear my heart pound over the hum of the air conditioning of that room in Cubao, and the occasional noise of MRT passing by.  then the phone rang, okay, send her up.  I was already at the door, looking through the peephole, doorbell rang, and what I see is way more than my expectations.  I let her in the room  with usual awkward greeting, i saw her underneath the smile were braces.  her hair was in a ponytail, she was wearing pants, a decent dress with a blazer, but you would know the looks of people that she may have come across, definitely, she may had a lot of those.  her eyes were pretty, but I know you wont be looking up right away.  small talk, how hot was the weather, and she had to walk from Farmers Cubao just to get here, she was kind but you will know she wont take your BS, somehow we got along with our sense of humor on what was on the TV,   she was still sweating even with the AC on max, I already did showered ahead, as she already knew when she touched my hair, while we were kissing, so di na sya naka tiis, she wants to go ahead and shower. ""Can I go with you?"" , she laughed with a ""No"", took 1 towel and went.  it was 15 minutes past, and I thought it's gonna take long.   she opens the bathroom door, it was still steaming with the hot water shower running, she was relieved with it, she has the towel of her hair drying it off.  The younger me will forever hold that sight, etched in the back of my mind.   a body of a Venus, smooth, and white as the only white light in the room they were naturals, they were perfect, they defy gravity, 40D, and I would say she was not curvy at all, that waistline, those hips, it's just unbelievable.  It was hard as diamonds.  You can only, and will only imagine what a pair of smooth, soft surfaces can do to a pillar of straight up 1 month of no nut, plus the caresses and fingers that I use to play with guitar chords on John Mayer songs  Got the extra thins, and put in on.  she let out a gasp, a 'tangina' and commented on the size, again, I am saying this as I was told, and after 2 women telling me, I am bound to believe it.  she was struggling in missionary, often trying to crawl up, but not in pain, I would know by now if it's faked, but we do, the more it slides and gets lubrication.  she ask is she can have more top control, I obliged, and I was drowning with the view, i swear there was a time I cant breathe right i have to ask her to back away a bit, she did , but still won't stop , she was getting it more than I do. then we switched positions.  On fours, she says she was getting tired and says she already had multiples and ask if ""matagal ka pa ba""  yes, think so , like I always do when wearing it.  she asks to take it off, it the heat of the moment so I did.  it slided in with much more tightness an grip , the kind I had not experienced with priors, sliding perfectly like a well oil piston, moist as rain.   asking me to be careful that it not go off inside.  and off it goes, pulling out at the right moment.  had a rest, I was already drinking my 2nd can of RH, we did seconds , she ask me not to put one on, cause she liked it that way, i dont recall all the details due to the horses kicking in, but there were alot of positions involved.  She says she has a boyfriend at that time, but he didn't have what I have, also reassured me, the handler gets them tested.  so am I , cause I can get it free.  she was kinda hurrying after the 2nd, cause the handler was already texting her while we do it, she says this guy is always in a bad mood when there was no updates after the 3 hour deed. I didn't notice we were already 30 mins overtime.  She left as fast as she arrived, a kiss on the lips, and phone number saved in my new phone.  *****  we were supposed to meet again, cutting the middle man prices, but schedule conflict, never pushed through, and her number being lost and suddenly, we just lost contact, I know her real Facebook account, but that is one thing I say to myself not contact her there  *****  I hear she is living fine now, with a kid, as of 2020, already left the past behind, I'm actually happy for her, she somehow maintained the figure, a bit of curves but in the right places.   *****  It was a bit risky in hindsight, but that was 2009, we were both safe , and I am safe as of today, though I've already retired this way of life, and I am not advocating not being safe when doing it, this is just a retelling of what happened.  more to come next time",Philippines,t5_2qjov,/r/Philippines/comments/leug9r/sex_lies_and_redemption_my_recollections10_years/gngza25/

448,60,5,1,1642690723,"&gt; MANILA- Public Attorney's Office (PAO) chief Persida Acosta hit back at Senator Franklin Drilon on Thursday after he said she should be barred from going to work physically due to not being vaccinated against COVID-19.   Acosta said that Drilon should not attack her personally, but instead go after Republic Act 11525, or the COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021.   Unvaccinated PAO chief must be barred from attending work in-person: Drilon According to Acosta, the law acknowledged the experimental nature of COVID-19 vaccines, mandated the creation of a national vaccine indemnity fund, and rendered vaccinators and vaccine manufacturers immune from suit and liability.   She said that under the law, vaccine cards should not be considered an additional mandatory requirement for educational, employment, and other similar government transactions.   ""Provided further that the vaccine cards shall not be considered as an additional mandatory requirement for educational, employment and other similar government transaction. Walang mandatory vaccination,"" Acosta said. ""Batas ho ito eh. Republic Act 11525. Bakit ako po ang kanilang pinepersonal? Eh di atakihin nila ‘tong batas na ito.""  (There is no mandatory vaccination. This is law. Republic Act 11525. Why am I being attacked personally? They should attack this law.)   ""Eh Kongreso po ang gumawa nitong Republic Act 11525? Hindi naman ako. Wala akong pirma dito.""  (Congress came up with Republic Act 11525, not me. I didn't sign it.)   She said it was up to a person whether they should get vaccinated against COVID-19. She also said that vaccines were still under Emergency Use Authorization, and that they should be given a Certificate of Product Registration (CPR) first before they are made mandatory.   ""Pwedeng i-mandatory vaccination, kung may CPR na ‘yan at proven na walang namamatay, walang nai-incapacitate, walang natatak, walang nagma-myocarditis, kahit sinasabi ng mga gumawa ng bakuna na ‘yan ang side effect. Eh kung wala, bigyan ng CPR,"" she said.   (You can do mandatory vaccinations if the vaccine has a CPR and it's proven that nobody will die from it, nobody gets incapacitated, nobody gets myocarditis, even if the vaccine makers said these are the side effects. If the vaccine doesn't have any of these, then give it a CPR.)   Acosta accused Drilon of not following the issue she initially raised, which was the supposed unconstitutionality of government's ""no vax, no ride"" policy.   ""Eh 50 million pa yung hindi nababakunahan eh? Eh di lahat ng hindi bakunado, hindi niya papasukin? Anong mangyayari ‘dun?"" the PAO chief said. ""Eh hindi niya sinusundan yung logic ng issue, dapat may major premise, minor premise, tsaka conclusion. Kung puro minor premise lang, ay walang katuturan yung conclusion na wag nang papasukin si Persida Acosta.""  (50 million Filipinos aren't vaccinated yet. So if they're unvaccinated, he wouldn't allow them to go to work? What will happen then? He's not following the logic of the issue. There should be a major premise, minor premise, then the conclusion. If it's all just minor premises, then the conclusion that Persida Acosta should not be allowed to go to work is worthless.)   But Acosta also said that she bore no ill-will toward Drilon.   ""Wala po akong masamang tinapay kay Sir Frank. Mahal na mahal ko po ‘yan kaya kahit na binabanatan niya ako parang siguro ‘di ko alam bakit galit sa akin ‘to eh binoto naman namin siya,"" she said.   (I don't have any grudges toward Sir Frank. I love him very much even though he's hitting me like this. It's like I don't know why he's so mad at me, even though we voted for him.)   Drilon said earlier on Thursday that Acosta should get vaccinated against COVID-19 since she was a government official. He warned that her not doing so could result in credibility issues for Manila's vaccination campaign.   The Senate minority leader added that he was ""open for a debate"" on a mandatory vaccination policy.   Health Secretary Francisco Duque III also urged Acosta to get the jab, saying that she was almost a senior citizen and should get extra protection against COVID-19.   The PAO chief earlier said that she was waiting for what she called a ""protein-based"" COVID-19 vaccine.",Philippines,t5_2qjov,/r/Philippines/comments/s8ktsp/unvaccinated_acosta_blasts_drilon_over_call_to/htgqn5t/

I choose - out of my own free will - to wait - and you need to let me have that right.   **Because the virus spreads vaccinated or not**  Here are some more fun facts:  - Pfizer in 2009 had to pay $2.3 billion dollars as settlement, according to the US Department of Justice. The charges? FRAUD. Look it up. - There is a FOIA case filed in the US for the US FDA to release the vaccine safety data which it claims would take 75 years to produce - the judge ruled to have it whittled down to 8 months. - In Switzerland, did you know that they issue ""Natural Immunity Certificates"". That's when you are positive - recovered, they give you a Certificate equal in weight to Vaxx Pass, for 365 days.  - In the Philippines, the FDA recently approved vaccination for kids on Dec. 23, 2021.

492,104,49,0,1626080425,"The EU's ""Digital COVID Certificate"", which is colloquially referred to as the EU's ""vaccine passport"" is a one-pager document that's supposed to make it easy for people to travel through and across the Schengen region by having a singularly-recognized, uniform declaration of a person's vaccination status.  It's this thing that supposedly only recognizes Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and AstraZeneca (specifically, the Western-manufactured version of AZ, and not the licensed versions of AZ from India, South Korea, or Thailand).  The ""rumor"" about Sinovac (and other vaccines) is based on how the Digital COVID Certificate has not yet been uniformly implemented across all EU countries, and __the EU has given its member states individual discretion on recognizing/allowing vaccines that the European Medicines Agency has not yet approved__.  For example: https://www.dw.com/en/which-eu-countries-accept-vaccinated-travelers/a-57808870  &gt; **People entering Spain** from what it deems ""risk"" areas — including many EU members and most other countries in the world — **can avoid quarantine requirements by showing proof of full vaccination with a jab approved by** the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or **the World Health Organization (WHO) at least 14 days before arriving**, proof of recovery from COVID-19, or a negative test.  [and noting here that Sinovac is included within this classification of vaccines approved by the WHO, even if it is not (yet) approved by the EMA]  &gt; **The Greek government** lists the following vaccines among those accepted: Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax, Johnson and Johnson, **Sinovac**, Sputnik V, Casino Biologics, and Sinopharm.  In contrast:  &gt; France recognizes all vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency and considers travelers fully vaccinated two weeks after their final dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or AstraZeneca jabs, and four weeks after the single shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.  So given that France specifically does not recognize vaccines that are (only) approved by the WHO, and also does not specifically name Sinovac, then presumably a person vaccinated with Sinovac might not be able to enter France (without an urgent need/without undergoing quarantine), even if they might be able to enter Greece or Spain.  Or as another example:  &gt; However, fully vaccinated passengers with valid vaccination certificates are entirely exempt, no matter the color code of the country they come from. **Cyprus accepts all vaccines approved for use in the EU as well as the Sputnik V and Sinopharm shots**.

536,148,30,0,1626080425,"The EU's ""Digital COVID Certificate"", which is colloquially referred to as the EU's ""vaccine passport"" is a one-pager document that's supposed to make it easy for people to travel through and across the Schengen region by having a singularly-recognized, uniform declaration of a person's vaccination status.  It's this thing that supposedly only recognizes Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and AstraZeneca (specifically, the Western-manufactured version of AZ, and not the licensed versions of AZ from India, South Korea, or Thailand).  The ""rumor"" about Sinovac (and other vaccines) is based on how the Digital COVID Certificate has not yet been uniformly implemented across all EU countries, and __the EU has given its member states individual discretion on recognizing/allowing vaccines that the European Medicines Agency has not yet approved__.  For example: https://www.dw.com/en/which-eu-countries-accept-vaccinated-travelers/a-57808870  &gt; **People entering Spain** from what it deems ""risk"" areas — including many EU members and most other countries in the world — **can avoid quarantine requirements by showing proof of full vaccination with a jab approved by** the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or **the World Health Organization (WHO) at least 14 days before arriving**, proof of recovery from COVID-19, or a negative test.  [and noting here that Sinovac is included within this classification of vaccines approved by the WHO, even if it is not (yet) approved by the EMA]  &gt; **The Greek government** lists the following vaccines among those accepted: Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax, Johnson and Johnson, **Sinovac**, Sputnik V, Casino Biologics, and Sinopharm.  In contrast:  &gt; France recognizes all vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency and considers travelers fully vaccinated two weeks after their final dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or AstraZeneca jabs, and four weeks after the single shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.  So given that France specifically does not recognize vaccines that are (only) approved by the WHO, and also does not specifically name Sinovac, then presumably a person vaccinated with Sinovac might not be able to enter France (without an urgent need/without undergoing quarantine), even if they might be able to enter Greece or Spain.  Or as another example:  &gt; However, fully vaccinated passengers with valid vaccination certificates are entirely exempt, no matter the color code of the country they come from. **Cyprus accepts all vaccines approved for use in the EU as well as the Sputnik V and Sinopharm shots**.  This means that Sino**vac** specifically would not count for Cyprus, even if Sino**pharm** does.  If you actually were going to plan a trip to Europe, and you were vaccinated with Sinovac (or Sinopharm, as in the case of the San Juan), you'd basically have to check on a per-country basis.

I have no family or friends in the USA - This is NOT an exaggeration. I could get an apartment, but I just feel it would be pointless unless it's required for a passport - read below about that.  You choose to be homeless. That is your fault. You failed. How does one not have friends or family? Sounds like you have anti-societal problems. You failed.   &gt;I would like to travel to Philippines. I seem to like the people there more. They don't seem to have as much drugs or alcohol or smoking or random sex or vulgarity as much as America. I hate the USA because everyone I meet does ""Weed"", gets drunk and high, or smokes, takes pride in having sex with random people, have immense ego and entitlement, employees give the worst and unprofessional experience,band I just don't like people in the USA.  You know nothing about the PHILIPPINES probably other than Filipinas who will love you long time. Stop reading those SEX PAT blogs.   DRUGS are prevalent in the PHILIPPINES also and nothing more different than the States. If you tried to make some minimal effort, you can read about all the drug-related news. Like drinking doesn't exist here? It does. Everything you hate in the States exists in the PHILIPPINES as well. Think of the Philippines as little America. Your ideas of paradise is incorrect and your sources are wrong.   The people you despise there is your fault b/c you choose to not associate with other people in the States.

If you had a permanent home then this wouldn't be an issue. Again that's your fault for living out of a car.   &gt;I don't have the Covid Vaccine because I think Covid is a overhyped propaganda piece, but I would be willing to get a vaccine to travel, otherwise I won't in America. I'll even wear a mask as mandatory even though I never wear one in the USA.  See previous post, but you are a COVID denier. You drank the q-anon Trump koolaid.

A simple search online will do. No one's going to spoon feed you.   &gt;I also don't know if there are any specific requirements needed like additional vaccination for other things or if the address on the passport has to be my new apartment if I get one.

548,160,42,2,1623272819,"OFWs are victims. My fiance used to be one. The agency you sign on with holds your passport so you can't change your mind, and I think you have to pay them back for connecting you with an assignment. Once you're overseas, your boss will hold onto the passport so you can't leave. You work 6 days a week and would be lucky if you are able to use the phone, step outside to experience snow, or even go to church.  OFWs in the middle east have less rights. Muslim families will be hard on you and try to get you to switch religions in exchange for them to be nicer to you. They may try to rape you, so you have to look as unattractive as possible.  Unfortunately being an OFW is one of the few ways to make enough salary to support a family. The Philippines is a major producer of manpower for other countries. The OFW industry is strong. I remember one time I was flying out overseas for vacation, and a long line of pinays sat in a straight line at the airport. They all looked scared and sad, and were obviously headed for an OFW assignment.  What is worse than having one OFW in the family is having two OFWs. I know one little girl that doesn't want to stay with her mom or dad when they come back from the Philippines. She clings onto the friend that her parents left her with, and she can't sleep without the parents' friend.  But even though OFWs are victims, they are still heroes too. They sacrifice being with their families and agree to the abuse they receive overseas just so that their children could survive. If the OFWs didn't go abroad, perhaps their families would be living in the street searching for scraps of food in the trash.  My fiance and child are in the Philippines, but they can't come abroad to live with me because of the pandemic (there's no vaccine for young kids, and adults headed here have been getting infected on the airplanes). We may have been separated for over a year, and in a way I feel like an OFW trapped overseas. But instead of quitting my job and moving to them, I work and live abroad alone so that I can provide a roof over their heads and food for their stomach. I would rather sacrifice my wants and desires if it means my child is healthy and taken care of. I missed his first steps. I missed his first words. I missed his first time eating solid food. The last time I saw him he couldn't roll and I could hold him in one arm, but now he's probably a third of my height.

571,1,1,0,1638679920,"My wife had a similar thought originally with ours but quixkly thought better of it when her friends who were still there told her how hard it is to find a good OB and hospital system over there compared to here.  I'd be too worried about Ukraine's abysmal handling of COVID, the possibility of Russia messing with Marisol by then, the risk of complications that could make it hard for her or the baby to fly home any time soon after birth, the doctors' lack of familiarity with your wife leading up to the birth, the local hospital's capacity to appropriately handle complications if they arise, and the paperwork headaches you and the kid would have to go through now and in the future. Plus, babies come early fairly often, sometimes by a month or more, so this can be hard and stressful to plan for properly and you don't want her giving birth on a plane or while you're a whole ocean away or unable to get there because of travel restrictions.   Complications happen- for example, after nearly a day of labor my wife needed an emergency C section to survive and the baby was jaundiced, but our hospital in the US had it all covered beautifully. Her best friend in Kyiv, by contrast, went into labor early with severe bleeding and was taken to a state hospital (nor the private practice place she'd been planning for) that was not at all personable and didn't even let her husband in there for hours, nor did they even try to minimize C section scarring. How confident are you that she'll definitely be admitted to a place with great quality care and expertise to handle surprises well and put her first and adhere to her birth plan all the way through? How sure are you that they'll let you in to be with her for the whole process, and how sure are you that you'll be able to communicate with the doctors and staff fluently enough in Russian to be effective as her and the baby's advocate if there's any conflict or complication? Will you be able to understand what's happening if there is a complication, or will you just be in blind panic? If she needs physical therapy or the baby needs special treatment or she struggles with post-partum depression, are you fairly certain the resources to deal with that are available in Mariupol and that you'll be able to adjust your travel plans to make sure she and the baby get the care they need first?  Also unless she's moving there, doing this means taking a tired, post-pregnancy mama and a little baby on international flights during COVID whenever you're ready to come home to the US. Right now there are ever-changing, pretty stringent teating requirements, mandatory masking, and the looming threat of more travel bans that will make these flights extra risky and extra difficult, and if this is your first you have NO idea how hard it is to travel with a tiny baby even in normal times. Plus the baby won't be vaccinated against COVID or likely many other things we usually vaccinate babies for in the US, so there's that risk during travel as well.   Also of course you won't be able to bring the baby back without a passport. You'll have to choose whether to try to get a US passport for the baby while in Ukraine if you can manage to do it (I don't even wanna know how complicated it is to get the birth certificate and have it translated and notarized and given to the US embassy or however you do it), or getting the kid a Ukrainian passport- which MIGHT cause an issue if your wife is trying to get away with having dual citizenship, and could be impossible if she has already lost Ukrainian citizenship (there is no birthright citizenship in Ukraine so being born there won't be enough to get the baby a passport). When she goes to exit Ukraine, the border folks will see her US passport but notice that the baby has Ukrainian cirizenship, so that may cause some trouble at the passport control kiosk. If she tries to exit with a Ukrainian passport, the airline won't be OK with that because she won't have an active US visa or green card and the border folks at the kiosk might notice the lack of visa as well and start asking some tough questions. If you don't have a rare direct flight to the US, the baby's passport not matching either of yours might cause delays and stress at security in your connecting airport too.  I'm sure you can find a way to legally and logistically pull this off if you really NEED to but man, if this is your first baby I'm telling you this now: you're going to be exhausted and overwhelmed and not thinking straight enough without also having international travel with a newborn during a pandemic and citizenship/ passport control paperwork to contend with. When y'all think about doing this, always remember that citizenship and the birth experience need to be secondary concerns and the primary, most important thing is to come out of this with a healthy baby and a heavy mama. Make your decisions based on whatever gives you the best chance at that, and forget everything else.",ukraine,t5_2qqcn,/r/ukraine/comments/r95rep/my_wife_is_pregnant_with_our_first_child_in_the/hnadqsz/

I'm not brave enough for restraints so I can't recommend anything there but museums, restaurants and some shops will ask for your covid certificate so be aware.

573,3,3,0,1637491811,"Wasn't aiming my comment at you, but at the general state of ""what if russia invades"" IT DID, in 2014. But foreign news tried to make it seem like it's some Martians from outer space just backed by russia or something.   &gt;the numbers of fatalities throughout this conflict are much much lower than potential ones in hypothetical open all out war  That's the CEASEFIRE casualties. Cease fire. Has them bomb us dozen of times every day. And then Germany or France whines if Ukraine fires back.  Another problem is that it's hybrid war. They found a very effective weapon that kills much more than russian artillery could dream off: antivaxxers. Russians use insane amounts of money on disinformation campaign and since pandemic started they've been working full time on providing COVID disinformation. Actually several statements by investigators and tons of research backing it up.  It also explains a statistical anomaly: why the hell is Ukraine the lowest-vaccinated country in Europe? It's SIGNIFICANTLY behind others, probably the only state where there's so many idiots paying money to get a fake certificate instead of getting a free vaccine and spend whole 20 seconds in a mobile app to get certified.

REALLY hate their narrative overall, they're the worst kind of news, the ""happy pretender"" ones, not only apprehending some of many disinformation networks doesn't thwart the entire plan, just throws a spanner there, but also their attitude of a ""possible"", ""future"" invasion instead of ongoing war that might be escalated. If people actually used the right words, i.e. a ""full scale offensive campaign"" instead of ""starting an invasion"", it would be less confusing to people who don't follow Ukrainian news for yeats.  Another article on the overall shebang, citing real good sources: https://www.codastory.com/disinformation/ukraine-vaccine-hesitancy/  On bright side, russians do get hoisted by their own petard too: https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/covid-19-disinformation-backfires-russian-deaths-climb-eu-says-2021-10-21/   So yes, they can kill way more people if they use aircraft and/or lead another full scale offensive like in 2014 or 15, but the most effective weapon is the ""vaccine skepticism,"" with way higher mortality rate than any war. Literally daily deaths from COVID are higher than yearly death toll from the war.

Neither upon checkin or upon arrival in Ukraine that date was questioned.   Upon check in (KLM) - requested vaccine card and proof of insurance. Although our American insurance covers us internationally, we bought the one from the website just to avoid any issues.   KLM plane was half full. Very friendly. Everyone was mostly in compliance with mask requirements and had an empty space between their party and another party.   Layover/transfer in Amsterdam - no issues. Only looked at passport and boarding pass.   Both journeys requested social distancing when exiting the plane - both times that was completely ignored. Worse on the Amsterdam to Kiev arm.   On the Amsterdam to Kiev flight, one older man didn’t want to cover his nose with mask, so the flight attendants was getting angry with him and threatened to turn the plane around if he didn’t comply. Although many others had their masks slightly below their noses, I guess his was just more obvious. He eventually covered his face until she walked away.   Getting though border patrol at boryspil airport:  Again, no social distancing followed at all. We arrived at around 2pm - it was busy. Before getting in line, man in uniform ask to see vaccination record or proof of negative test. If someone held up the line, some  snuck through without showing anything. The line for foreign citizens was pst the UA citizens entry line, but somehow Ukrainian citizens ended up in the foreign line so they converted one of the station from “all passports” to “UA citizens.” So it was “all passports” “UA citizens” “all passports” “UA citizens” X5.   Some people were cutting in line, but no one would say anything, I guess because we weren’t sure if they were catching up with their other family members. A couple were. Most weren’t. People working at the airport paid zero attention to that.   The lines were getting backed up by people why either didn’t have proof of insurance printed and clearly showing coverage in Ukraine, or if they weren’t vaccinated and struggled to activate the “Vdoma” app. I did not see any Russian or Indian citizens (explain more later).    Once I got to the border patrol, I gave him my passport, CDC vaccination card, and printed copy of UA insurance. He only asked the name of my vaccine, which after 24 hrs of traveling and not sleeping (can’t sleep on planes) I struggled with😅. Asked me to lower my mask and take off my glasses, stared at my face for what felt like forever and let me go.   Once we got our luggage we went through the green customs line (not having to declare anything), but a girl came up to us to ask where we were coming from, what we were bringing and how much money we had. We said personal belongings and the amount was under the restricted amount. She smiled and said thank you so we went on.   Next we needed to get a taxi. The signs where to get taxi weren’t clear. The security at the door  wasn’t helpful. Tired and just wanting to get to our place of rest we went outside and took up one of the guys offering the taxi. The price was $35, which is about 2.5 times the fair market value (I checked beforehand). The guy acts as a call agent and takes half from the taxi driver he calls. At this point we didn’t mind, similar trip would be similarly priced in the US. Thankfully we got a nice and polite driver with Citrion that fit our 4 bags of luggage.   About Indians and Russians. When we walked outside the terminal, there were many camera men and journalists. Someone even came up to us to take interview - we weren’t interested. Later on TV saw a segment about all the people they were defining from Russia. Rules for Russia and India require that anyone arriving in boryspil EVEN IF TRANSFERRING quarantine in Ukraine for 14 days without possibility of testing. There are families traveling  from Turkey to Russia through Ukraine and now they have to stay in Ukraine for 2 weeks. Given what I said earlier about how no one gave a *** about social distancing lines, I don’t see how this 2 week rule helps the COVID situation. Obviously they showed some very upset people, one guy punched the border patrol person, one threw his phone on the ground, another tried to bribe the agent. This was upsetting to watch and I am glad we didn’t see any of it in person while at the airport.   General observation about Boryspil. All staff speaks to you in Ukrainian before speaking English. Maybe because I was born there and still have my round Eastern European cheeks, but I found it weird for an international airport - main in the country. Some staff obviously didn’t speak English. If I didn’t know Russian or Ukrainian - this would stress me out. Overall I was hoping for more cleanliness, order, and organization. It wasn’t terrible, but I think they can and should improve their catering towards foreign citizens. Especially coming from Schiphol airport - the contrast was night and day. There were some Dutch, Americans, Canadians, and middle eastern tourists in the foreign line with us and I had wished their first impression of Ukraine could be better.

597,27,4,0,1633905497,"Zero trust in government and medicine, that's what. I always said that for real *reforms*, we need to give Uliana Suprun a ***large chainsaw***.  Yesterday got my 2nd dose of vaccine, and *medpersonnel at reception were wearing masks below the nose.* Despite processing many people by mid-day, they still somehow pointed me the wrong way (you need doctor to sign the pamphlet before getting the jab, and people who give said pamphlet literally told me to go ""behind the curtain"" first, from where the nurse quickly directed me back to doctor who was too busy chatting and had to call for another random doctor to sign the paperwork).   Then, after getting my second dose of Pfizer, nobody in the vaccination center knew where to input the data so it would get into my documents, or Diya app. It appears, the doctors who aren't chatting simply don't know how to use computers... Odessa, urban European city with million population, 2021. We live in bureaucratic hell that digitized records without having devices to access said records, the clinic I went to before that literally couldn't access everything because there was a blackout at their ISP for a week. Need surgery? Wait till they fix the internet.  The amount of doctors who defend use of placebo to fool patients ""because they will not understand anyway and want more medicine"" is astounding. Fake diagnoses (literally not existing outside of ex-USSR) are rampant and antibiotics prescribed against viral illnesses at random is the norm.  One time I had to get an ultrasound scan, after visiting two clinics that were out of personnel, in a central regional hospital, avoiding the breaking chairs that a guy with both legs broken had to stand near. I got what I wanted after waiting for doctor who randomly locked herself in room for an hour with no clients, but since reception didn't ask from people to wear masks (unlike McDonalds, who know better medicine than doctors, apparently) as they were coughing, my scan cost me a week of respiratory illness (I already went through long COVID by that point from a heavy coughing maskless delivery driver who was bragging he didn't stop working when sick – irony is I ordered online to avoid people's sneezes and coughs during pandemic).  So, by this point, most people learned that if you want to stay healthy, you avoid doctors and especially hospitals where you're basically guaranteed to catch something extra on top of what you had already. My friend almost died from coronavirus and 42 C fever for weeks, but stayed at home, self-isolating. He refuses to get vaccinated after seeing Ukrainian BBC and other news report on one guy who died following vaccination (corellation/causation be damned). So international media is actively sabotaging vaccination as well, and add shitty healthcare system and you get less than 15% cleared.  Some extra special idiots pay exorbitant amounts of money to get a vaccine certificate (vaccination is free) without getting a jab, and guess who helps them sign and register them...

614,44,8,0,1628198460,"August 5 update:   TLTR: If you’re vaccinated, have their insurance printed out, and you’re not from Russia or India -  everything will go smooth.  ——— We got JJ vaccine 5 days before we left US. Neither upon checkin or upon arrival in Ukraine that date was questioned.   Upon check in (KLM) - requested vaccine card and proof of insurance. Although our American insurance covers us internationally, we bought the one from the website just to avoid any issues.   KLM plane was half full. Very friendly. Everyone was mostly in compliance with mask requirements and had an empty space between their party and another party.   Layover/transfer in Amsterdam - no issues. Only looked at passport and boarding pass.   Both journeys requested social distancing when exiting the plane - both times that was completely ignored. Worse on the Amsterdam to Kiev arm.   On the Amsterdam to Kiev flight, one older man didn’t want to cover his nose with mask, so the flight attendants was getting angry with him and threatened to turn the plane around if he didn’t comply. Although many others had their masks slightly below their noses, I guess his was just more obvious. He eventually covered his face until she walked away.   Getting though border patrol at boryspil airport:  Again, no social distancing followed at all. We arrived at around 2pm - it was busy. Before getting in line, man in uniform ask to see vaccination record or proof of negative test. If someone held up the line, some  snuck through without showing anything. The line for foreign citizens was pst the UA citizens entry line, but somehow Ukrainian citizens ended up in the foreign line so they converted one of the station from “all passports” to “UA citizens.” So it was “all passports” “UA citizens” “all passports” “UA citizens” X5.   Some people were cutting in line, but no one would say anything, I guess because we weren’t sure if they were catching up with their other family members. A couple were. Most weren’t. People working at the airport paid zero attention to that.   The lines were getting backed up by people why either didn’t have proof of insurance printed and clearly showing coverage in Ukraine, or if they weren’t vaccinated and struggled to activate the “Vdoma” app. I did not see any Russian or Indian citizens (explain more later).    Once I got to the border patrol, I gave him my passport, CDC vaccination card, and printed copy of UA insurance. He only asked the name of my vaccine, which after 24 hrs of traveling and not sleeping (can’t sleep on planes) I struggled with😅. Asked me to lower my mask and take off my glasses, stared at my face for what felt like forever and let me go.   Once we got our luggage we went through the green customs line (not having to declare anything), but a girl came up to us to ask where we were coming from, what we were bringing and how much money we had. We said personal belongings and the amount was under the restricted amount. She smiled and said thank you so we went on.   Next we needed to get a taxi. The signs where to get taxi weren’t clear. The security at the door  wasn’t helpful. Tired and just wanting to get to our place of rest we went outside and took up one of the guys offering the taxi. The price was $35, which is about 2.5 times the fair market value (I checked beforehand). The guy acts as a call agent and takes half from the taxi driver he calls. At this point we didn’t mind, similar trip would be similarly priced in the US. Thankfully we got a nice and polite driver with Citrion that fit our 4 bags of luggage.   About Indians and Russians. When we walked outside the terminal, there were many camera men and journalists. Someone even came up to us to take interview - we weren’t interested. Later on TV saw a segment about all the people they were defining from Russia. Rules for Russia and India require that anyone arriving in boryspil EVEN IF TRANSFERRING quarantine in Ukraine for 14 days without possibility of testing. There are families traveling  from Turkey to Russia through Ukraine and now they have to stay in Ukraine for 2 weeks. Given what I said earlier about how no one gave a *** about social distancing lines, I don’t see how this 2 week rule helps the COVID situation. Obviously they showed some very upset people, one guy punched the border patrol person, one threw his phone on the ground, another tried to bribe the agent. This was upsetting to watch and I am glad we didn’t see any of it in person while at the airport.   General observation about Boryspil. All staff speaks to you in Ukrainian before speaking English. Maybe because I was born there and still have my round Eastern European cheeks, but I found it weird for an international airport - main in the country. Some staff obviously didn’t speak English. If I didn’t know Russian or Ukrainian - this would stress me out. Overall I was hoping for more cleanliness, order, and organization. It wasn’t terrible, but I think they can and should improve their catering towards foreign citizens. Especially coming from Schiphol airport - the contrast was night and day. There were some Dutch, Americans, Canadians, and middle eastern tourists in the foreign line with us and I had wished their first impression of Ukraine could be better.

Unfortunately, due to covid, I was unable to get an appointment until the 15th of October to renew my passport, and now I am quite worried that it won't come in time to renew my TRC. Especially as I need a week for my company to sort out my work permit with my new passport.   Additionally, due to covid, I'm obviously unable to do a visa run to Cambodia to buy myself a few months. Obviously I would also need my new passport to do this also as my passport is invalid once I've started the process of renewal, but this would usually have been an option if it arrived in time, but not soon enough to get my TRC sorted out.   I'm especially worried about the possibilitythat my passport won't arrive a all until after December 22nd as I don't trust the ability of the UK government to do anything in a timely manner.

There are no district attorneys just the police. * Get fined, beaten, falsely imprisoned, or killed by the police?
