6,6,0,1626590127,"Given 6 month validity of passport, and a negative PCR/ vaccinations… no problemo.  Turkey as a nation is a bit economically challenged and practically begging for tourists.  My wife and her family is Turkish, when I visited in December - I could travel freely, the in-laws were restricted to the hours and places they could go.  Crazy!  The brother in law needed police permission to take me for a medical consult while I was there, and paperwork from the hospital.  Me, passport.  My mother in law passed away in April, my wife and her family were very restricted… me, nope.    Places to visit depends also on your interests.  Istanbul &amp; the historical sites (Sultanahmet, the places, museums,…), Ephesus, Pamukkale, Cappadoccia, or even a weekend beach trip to Bodrum, Kusadasi, Kas, Fethiye,…. Decent mountains inside, nice scuba diving along the coast.  Currently, Eid.  Public holiday, so expect Istanbul to be somewhat deserted, few government offices open for anything, and people to be off to the beaches and vacation spots.  For Turkey, it’s hot right now.  But compared to the Middle East… it’s pretty decent.  It’s 36C in Doha right now, “only” 28C in Istanbul &amp; Antalya.  As with all places, pay attention to your surroundings and use common sense.  Pickpockets definitely exist.  The bazaar is there to take your money.  Absolutely agreed on taxis… open Waze and watch how you go.  I’ve surprised some drivers who tried to definitely go the very long way.  There are a lot of transients, refugees, beggars, etc… add in a poor economy, bad lira value, inflation, being locked up for a covid year, the country and its people are a bit stressed.

9,9,0,1623522044,"Well let me tell you how it is for a Turkish citizen in Turkey.  I became ""wanted"" due age limit. Basically received an SMS weeks after my birthday (unlucky being born in December) telling me to go nearest enrollment office. I didn't want to enroll right away, so I waited next enrollment period for 3 months.  During this three months police stopped me twice, which is much but they were doing routine checks due covid restrictions. One time they just told me to go to the enrollment office in 14 days, other time they wanted to make me sign a paper saying ""I will go"" in 14 days but I told them I applied from e-gov already and they did let me go.  Finally after February I started my process by applying through e-gov. It took me 1 week to pass from health check. Afterwards it was time to go to the enrollment office.  Even after applying no one takes you somewhere right away. They basically register you and give you a paper which releases you until next enrollment date, you are free until that date including flying internationally.   Why am I telling this?  I know people who passed their age limit yet didn't enroll for multiple years. As long as you don't start the service and then escape from barracks there is no mechanism which will forcefully take you to armed forces duty. Even when one agrees to go **it is not instant**.  I don't know your age but try your extension options, even if they don't apply for you, use your US passport and come to see your loved ones. I feel like worst case they will make you sign a paper which says you must apply for enrollment in 14 days and let you go. Including at border checks, especially with US passport.   tl;dr: **No one will drag you to anywhere by force.** So you can come and check all of your options including renouncing your citizenship during your visit.   I have no idea how renouncing works though. So you must check that.  Geçmiş olsun...",Turkey,t5_2qlnu,/r/Turkey/comments/nxv3sm/my_mother_is_on_her_deathbed_at_this_moment_and_i/h1jfzpf/
