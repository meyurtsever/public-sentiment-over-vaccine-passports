My son felt sick &amp; messaged his boss to say he wanted to stay home &amp; see a doctor... his boss said to come to work or he'd be fired. This was the start of the shitfest.   Locked in a room at school for 10 hours, no drink, food or his stuff.  Transported to a military hospital.  Being shouted at by military every time he tried to ask a question with Google translate.  No results of any Covid tests given to him.  After I got our embassy involved, transferred to a general hospital. He had to pay for his food.  Brought by police to police station after 7 days in hospital... he still has no idea why.  Brought home by police, quarantine for ""many days""   It's his boss who contacted the police at the start of all this. My son has no idea why. His boss apparently paid for the hospitals (1,400 USD) which he has to reimburse, lost earnings of the school due to the Covid outbreak, the ""administration fees"" to cover the extra work of  contacting police, hospitals etc.   He hasn't overstayed his visa, but his boss fired him when he got Covid so his enforced stay will mean he is in the first month of having an expired visa ..... as if he's deliberately trying to stay.   He has given his ex boss the blood money &amp; passport to get his exit visa. This takes 45 days according to the money grabbing bastard. The visa lawyer said it takes 5 - 8 days.   One of the guys he worked with, pretended to beat up a colleague so he could complain &amp; he got deported.   Another guy paid his school 2,800 for his exit visa on 29th December &amp; still waiting for it. He's living in a hostel in Hanoi with little to no money except what the other teachers can give him.   None of them have been paid since the start of November &amp; this is happening in at least 6 schools...that I'm aware of.   Thanks for taking the time to read my rant. Listen out for screams of joy in a few weeks when planes leave Hanoi with teachers on board...",VietNam,t5_2qkcr,/r/VietNam/comments/s7so22/whats_your_favorite_holiday/hthsllg/

For context, I’m a US citizen and I’m fully vaccinated with boosters for Covid and have a passport.  I want to travel to Ho Chi Minh and travel within the city freely and not on a tourist package which would cost an exuberant amount of money.  Are regular tourist visas even being accepted right now?   I see there are tickets available to fly to Ho Chi Minh, but most either cost a lot or they are 50 hour flights. And I’ve read in multiple places flights from the US are limited to four a week and on a trial basis.  If there is a better place to post this question, please tell me.

Don't know how to get that document though, maybe the local VN embassy in your country can help.  If you go via Bangkok, it would be better if you have a transit ticket.

I don't agree with the many expats who stayed here on tourist visas but at least I don't reek of envy. It's a really bad look when Vietnamese whine and complain about how much easier foreigners have it supposedly, like we all come from some magical utopia. We get it, our passport are stronger, why do you need to whine and complain about it? Envy is an ugly color  &gt;Vietnamese trying to get to your country on a ""good day"", pre-covid would have been a much more brutal journey than having a few inconvenient layovers. Get a grip mate, you are crying because your preferred airline wasn't running and you had a few stops along the way?? What a joke! &gt;That is what a little kid considers ""stranded"", because it was inconvenient for them. Ask your Viet friends how it was getting into Oz, UK, USA. You were annoyed? LMFAO  You're making a [false equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence), so nice logical fallacy. Are you aware even that it simply wasn't possible to enter Australia for quite a long time? You're way oversimplifying what's happened and showing your ignorance. Sure, there were flights but not as many as you think. A South African friend has been trying to leave the country since Nov but her flights keep getting canceled. An Australian friend of mine said he would've gone back home to wait out the pandemic but he was unable to enter Australia. (neither of those friends are on tourist visa FWIW)   Also you may not realize this but many of the expats who have remained are people who have lived abroad for a very long time and don't really have a home to go back to. Many (probably most really) of those on tourist visas are older retirees as well who at this point in their life don't have family or homes back in their countries, they're too old to find decent work (getting a job is much more difficult for people who are retirement age in western countries), living expenses are far higher so they would have to go through much more of their savings than planned or find jobs. And it's not like there's a pile of jobs waiting for them back home. Maybe you can see why going back to their home country would be very difficult for some   Basically, grow the fuck up before you try to have a discussion with adults.",VietNam,t5_2qkcr,/r/VietNam/comments/s26vt2/stranded_foreigners_in_vietnam_given_only_days_to/hsgnwyr/
5,0,1636982118,"Hi, I'm in a bit of trouble here and would appreciate some help/advice  My TRC runs out on the 22nd of December and I'm having to renew my passport before I can apply for a new one.  Unfortunately, due to covid, I was unable to get an appointment until the 15th of October to renew my passport, and now I am quite worried that it won't come in time to renew my TRC. Especially as I need a week for my company to sort out my work permit with my new passport.   Additionally, due to covid, I'm obviously unable to do a visa run to Cambodia to buy myself a few months. Obviously I would also need my new passport to do this also as my passport is invalid once I've started the process of renewal, but this would usually have been an option if it arrived in time, but not soon enough to get my TRC sorted out.   I'm especially worried about the possibilitythat my passport won't arrive a all until after December 22nd as I don't trust the ability of the UK government to do anything in a timely manner. However, if this is the case I'm really really not sure what to do as I'd be without my passport, nor the money to get a plane back to the UK (I'd also prefer not to have to travel back there.   I was just hoping for any advice to calm my nerves about this a bit.   Thanks :)",VietNam,t5_2qkcr,/r/VietNam/comments/qk1xt6/post_your_questions_inquiries_here_rvietnam/hkpsbdk/

The level of corruption in America is absolutely negligible when compared to the deep-seated corruption in authoritarian Vietnam.  Let me know when Socialist Vietnam spends 18% of its GDP on social safety nets and welfare.  As it stands:   * Can't afford K-12? Go sell lottery tickets.  * Can't afford to put a deposit down on a hospital visit? Die or get out because there is no option of going into debt or setting up payment plans.  * Every damn city floods horribly after the slightest bit of rain year after year. * Dogshit passport.  * Lose a family member to vehicular manslaughter? Did a loved one get raped? Tough. Take the money because the officials have already taken theirs and buried the case. There are no district attorneys just the police. * Get fined, beaten, falsely imprisoned, or killed by the police? Sorry, the Party's decision is law and anyone who disagrees is reactionary that must be punished for abusing democratic freedoms. * Starve to death during COVID because there is no stimulus package, payment freeze, or civil and human rights.  * Homeless? You don't see the homeless because they're dead or pushed to the borders of Vietnam. There are no amenities for the homeless here.  The corruption in Vietnam is one-sided, the citizens receive zero benefits. And don't even try to quote the laws - they are a fucking farce and aren't worth the paper it is printed on.

I'm told you there are very talented people In Vietnam and I just wanted to throw something out there for software app devs to work on a potential side project.

I want to build a platform similar to Doordash/uber eats where customers can order food from a restaurant and have it delivered to their homes. But the difference between this app is it is unique because it only caters to communities. Let me explain. 1 Restaurant same time same day of the week. As a resident, I come down and grab my food which is bagged just for me and my name apt number on it. Take it home and feed my family dinner. Customer is happier then ordering through doordash or uber eats because there is little or no service charge or delivery fees. SAVE MONEY. Restaurants will love our partnership because we give them a large order, and we deliver, with little commission, not 30% like the other platforms charge the business owner. WIN-WIN. We add more restaurants and communities every day or the week as the business grows. How many restaurants and communities are in SF, CA, and every major city? So anyways dunno how complicated this may get, but I was gonna teach myself how to code but I wanna focus on SALES and business relationships here and have a person or team to help build the platform on the software side. I have all the logistics here from drivers on deck to restaurant relationships figured out. Dunno how much I can afford, not really much or nothing. But I know this can grow into a million-dollar business and possibly get aggressively acquired. If I find the right person in Vietnam I would be willing to talk.
