0,0,1643152742,"The global impact on the supply chain because of the pandemic has led to shortages of essential medicines in New Zealand, forcing pharmacies to ration them, as staff struggle with burnout.  About 24 medications, used to remedy illnesses such as inflammatory bowel disease, pain (analgesics), cardiac blood pressure, hormone replacement, smoking cessation and even certain antibiotics used by children, are running low.  Pharmac director of operations Lisa Williams said Covid-19 was having a global impact on manufacturing plants, workforce disruptions, logistics and supply chains.  ""Our contracts require companies to hold around three months' supply of their medicines in New Zealand and they place the onus on suppliers to source alternatives,"" Williams said.  ""Where suppliers go below or think there is the potential that they will go below the minimum level of stock, they are required to contact us with their management plan for the continuity of supply.""  In most cases, alternative medicines have been sourced, she said.  Pharmac, a Government agency that decides which medicines and related products are funded, pays for nearly 1000 medicines, she said.   Otago University professor and the president of the Pharmaceutical Society Rhiannon Braund said although alternatives for most medications running low were there, using another medicine was not always easy.  Prescription medicines were difficult to change because they not only require a new visit to the doctor, but also re-adjusting the doses and managing any possible side effects and reactions it may have on the patient, said Braund, who is also a member of Pharmac's pharmacology and therapeutics advisory committee.  New Zealand's independent pharmacists' association vice president Sarah Mooney said for the most part Pharmac decided how frequently pharmacies could dispense something, whether a repeat prescription or giving it all at once.  Usually, ""if we give a restricted supply due to shortages this is dictated to us by Pharmac"".  Since the first lockdown, pharmacists have been told to restrict paracetemol.  Chemists used to give it out up to the maximum quantity allowed on the script unless the doctor specified otherwise.  ""During the first lockdown, there were supply issues so we were told to give out no more than 100 per dispensing and no more than 300 per prescription - 100 with 2 repeats - unless the patient is on it regularly.  ""This is actually a lot of paracetamol and I don't believe restricting it to this quantity is actually a bad thing as it is New Zealand's most common poison; however as with most things, it is not our call. We just do what Pharmac or the doctor tell us to do,"" Mooney said. Which medicine is short changes all the time, she said.  ""It would really help if the public would 'shop normally' for their medicines.  ""During the first lockdown we ran low on a lot of regular medicines and Pharmac made us start dispensing it all monthly, but the only reason we were starting to run low was because people were stockpiling,"" Mooney said.  Recently pharmacies have been running low on blood pressure Quinapril and Locoid Lipocream, a common steroid cream for skin problems and they ran out of cefaclor suspension, a children's antibiotic.  ""It certainly consumes a lot of extra time trying to keep on top of what's available and arrange new prescriptions from doctors for alternative medicines when what they want isn't available,"" she said.  Shortages in workforce Upper Hutt Queen St pharmacy owner Brooke McKay said workload had increased in a huge way especially by having to do vaccinations and rapid antigen testing (RAT) and they ""definitely"" needed some extra helping hands.  But the process for the pharmacists to return back to work if they had taken some time off was an expensive and long process.  She said most pharmacists had been working 12 hours a day, seven days a week. She even had to return early from maternity leave and many were changing holiday plans.  ""Most pharmacists are doing well over 40 hours a week with owner pharmacists doing up to 60 hours a week and that's ongoing since the first lockdown. ""Most of us cancelled holiday breaks."" she said.  To mitigate the shortages of pharmacists in the country there should be an easier process for the recent retirees and locums to come on board.  Even qualified and experienced retired pharmacists have to pay about $1000 to re-register and do some form of training to be able to start working if they have been out of a job for more than three years.  ""We have stepped up and we have never shut our doors to our customers and we should be proud of our work. We will continue to serve our community throughout the pandemic,"" McKay said.  Mooney said: ""Pharmacists workloads have been increasing for a long time, but the pandemic has been the nail in the coffin for many of us and anecdotally there are a lot of pharmacists burned out from the pressure. ""We are anxious about picking up Covid-19 and taking it back to our families.  ""We are worn out from the extra workload - RATs and vaccine certificates just started seemingly out of the blue - at the busiest time of year and there wasn't time to organise extra staff so the existing staff just sucked up the extra work,"" she said.  Pharmacy council chief executive Michael Pead said the fee for an annual practising certificate (APC) is about $920 and has to be renewed every year in March in time for the practising year that runs from April 1 to March 31.  ""Council has arranged short-dated practising certificates to help former practising pharmacists - less than three years out of practice - return, to help workforce pressures. These processes are in place if and when required,"" he said.  ""We do not charge for short-dated certificates, in 'emergency' situations. Council applied this approach when in lockdowns and will likely do so under traffic light red and or as necessary in response to workforce pressures.  ""The period of the short dating will depend on the practitioners and the length of employment required - in the case of lockdowns, three months has been typical.""  Braund said the Covid-19 pandemic was not considered an emergency, unlike the aftermath of the Christchurch earthquake.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/scqjhv/essential_medications_rationed_due_to_supply/hu7xnqq/

Hospital capacity is not something that can be expanded quickly. No one is saying that it could have been, you're aiming this particular defence at no one.   The obvious issues are around our failure to prepare a transition to suppression were elimination to fail. The government had no contingencies, which is why we had a half-baked 3 step plan that was drawn up in a weekend. It's why we waited a ridiculous amount of time for a vaccine certificate system, and why there were inadequate resources prepared for mass at-home isolation of covid patients.   &gt;It is easy to be critical but what alternative at time time was better?

That means a person can easily change the name, birth date or expiry date of the pass that appears on their phone's screen, or that they print out. &gt;  &gt; The Ministry of Health said that was not a major issue, because those confirming a person's vaccination status would scan the QR code on the pass, which could not be edited. The NZ Pass Verifier app would also automatically reject a pass with an expired date (as recorded by its QR code), whatever is written on the document. &gt;  &gt; That's all well and good if a business has someone on the door actively scanning the passes. &gt;  &gt; But if they ease things along by just sighting a pass, then being able to edit it will become an issue. &gt;  &gt; Ardern said yesterday: ""The Verifier App - as we've said all along, handy tool, but it is not a requirement to operate. You can sight someone's vaccine pass. And if you have any concerns, you can ask for verifying ID, if you like."" &gt;  &gt; But it's not like, say, the age requirement for buying alcohol, where youthful appearance will trigger a bouncer to ask for ID. &gt;  &gt; There's no such obvious ""tell"" that a person has edited the expiry date on their pass - or, if don't know their way around Adobe Acrobat - that they have simply borrowed someone else's. &gt;  &gt; A photo ID on the vaccine pass is the obvious solution, but probably not one was tenable for a pass programme where one of the contracts wasn't signed until October 13. &gt;  &gt; Starting much earlier during the 16-month gap we had between the first lockdowns and Delta could probably have meant that was a goer (earlier, the MoH said it wanted to hang fire to see what vaccine certificate initiatives were developed overseas. &gt;  &gt; Ardern said such casual checks were ""no different from what most countries around the world are doing.

It could be a link (to take you straight to a web page), a message from your Mum, a shopping list, a vaccine certificate or whatever.  **What's inside the QR code on a My Vaccine Pass?**  In a My Vaccine Pass , the block of data in the QR code is a certificate.

It contains that person's name, date of birth, a unique ID, and the start date and expiry date of the certificate.  **How do I know that a My Vaccine Pass is legit?**  If you want to know if a staff member is vaccinated, would you trust a scrap of paper they handed to you with ""Fred Bloggs is vaccinated.

On our next team zoom meeting, I'll have all my team hold up their vaccine passes to the camera, then I'll scan them with the verifier. All good?**  No, that's a terrible idea.

The risk of having untested teachers just because they have a bright and shiny vaccine certificate is too great.   &gt;Your suggestion about making sure hospitals can cope is not a strategy that works in a pandemic. It takes 3 years to train a nurse, double and more for a doctor. The virus isn’t going to wait for that.  It depends on your definition of making sure hospitals can cope...   For me - it's not freezing the pay of our hospital staff in the middle of a pandemic. It's not keeping workers on temp visas and having them leave because we couldn't give them a permanent position and residence in this country so they left. It's making sure that nurses, doctors aids etc are paid appropriately so they can actually make a living instead of going overseas where they can make more money. Uts not sitting with your finger up your ass until the 13th of October 2021 before getting your department to start looking in to ways of getting health workers in to the country because they're not getting MIQ spots... we had over 1000 health workers ready and waiting to come here, to help us before the 2020 lockdown... they should have been let in and given priority. And it sure as hell is NOT firing a bunch of nurses and other health workers who last year put their health, their lives on the line to help us all out, make sure everyone got the care they needed just because they're uncomfortable with the Pfizer jab. Astrazeneca, J&amp;J, Jansen were approved AGES ago. Giving people the choice would have had a better uptake without having to force people. All the mandate has done is ensure our hospitals are even more understaffed, that nurses are under even more pressure and some of those will quit simply because they're burnt out/copping abuse from patients/ need something different.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/qtgdu9/covid19_delta_outbreak_act_leader_david_seymour/hko0yc9/

127,6,1636942657,"&gt;Your child’s class?   Simply my child's class size, I don't know if 28 children to 1 teacher is the norm, on the lower end or the higher end so using his classroom size as an example of how the risk I see.   &gt;I am advocating for all teachers to be vaccinated to reduce the risk of kids, who cannot currently get vaccinated, getting Covid. A Covid positive vaccinated teacher is much less likely to infect students regardless of their testing status than an unvaccinated one.  I completely disagree. If we use the Edmonton example again, the number of residents that were double vaccinated that were infected by a double vaccinated staff member is significant. If we put unvaccinated students in to a classroom with a double vaccinated covid positive teacher every single one of those children is at risk and will likely catch the virus.   I care more for the teacher actually being negative for covid than I do for them being vaccinated - in my view, if you can catch and pass it on while fully vaccinated (however less likely it is) I'd rather see a negative test than a vaccine certificate. Because regardless of your certificate, you can pass covid to my child if you have covid.   &gt;When vaccines are available for under 12 year olds becomes available will you have your children vaccinated?  Depends, I only have 1 in the 5-11 category, 3 much younger. And it will depend on what my sons GP and Pediatricic specialist advise us is best for him.

Hipkins: Uh, it's an option, so we're just working through what the options are, to ensure that we don't end up, you know, spending days sitting in their cars, and have all of Auckland grind to a halt.   Reporter: So how will you get that slot, then ? Will it be a lottery system for the slot ?  Hipkins: Look, like I said, we have not worked our way through any of that yet, uh, I'm just, what I'm foreshadowing is that we are considering whether, there are... *whether* and we haven't made decisions on it, whether there are practical ways of helping to manage that   Reporter: When do you reckon that you will be able to give people some assurity of this system. Can you give us the date that you will reveal the conditions and the means by which you can leave Auckland ?

172,2,1635975195,"2: 26 do not have sufficient information for a conclusion.   When people die there are two main pathways for how things proceed. If the death is unexpected for any reason, or suspicious in any way then the death is referred to the coroner. The police act on their behalf, gather information pertaining to the death and the coroner collates this information and reports on it. In the cases where the death is particularly notable or there are lessons to be learned (or mistakes made) which contributed to it this is where coroners inquiries or court comes into play.   For some people their deaths are expected. They could be old or have terminal conditions or just comorbidities which mean that if they die from certain events it is not a surprise.  In these cases their GP can sign their death certificate and the deceased goes straight to the funeral home for whatever practices their families culture or religion embraces from there.  Deaths in this second group are less likely to have extensive examinations conducted and therefore their reports could lack sufficient information from which any form or confident analysis could be made. The timeline between getting vaccinated and passing from an expected condition is variable and understandably many of these vulnerable patients choose to be vaccinated probably assuming that COVID would be extremely likely to kill them if they got it.   3a: Of the 6.5 million doses, 70% of those are second dose.  3b: Natural death rates were not applied to the scenario of 50,000 people.   I’m not sure about the first point (3a) with regards to 70% being second dose. To get second you must have had first. I would think that would create a lower limit of 50% for first dosing assuming everyone also followed it up with a second. I’m a math moron so very happy to have this one pulled apart.   When I did my initial sums I treated every vaccine administration as a potential harm event. Anaphylaxis for example usually comes from a strong reaction to first exposure then a potentially lethal overreaction to subsequent exposures. This is because the immune system is improperly primed to respond to the stimuli after the first experience. No response to first dose lowers the risk of an anaphylactic response to the second but I wanted to ensure the possibility was captured in the calculation.  I agree that there is probably better modelling that could be applied here when considering the risk of first vs second dose administration, though I think it would likely favour safety versus more adverse events.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/qdq7az/im_trying_to_convince_my_friend_to_get_vaccinated/hj7bkum/

208,3,1635570548,"So your entire argument boils down to ""better things aren't possible""?  Perhaps it's not my ignorance, but yours to think that there's no reasonable expectation of a better response to the pandemic. It's been proven over the last 10 weeks that there was absolutely more the government could have done to prepare.  It essentially boils down to them being too incompetent/strung by bureaucracy to implement policy that could have put us in a much better position. Some examples include:  \-Developing a domestic vaccination certificate system [earlier,](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-passports-on-their-way-for-kiwis/DYUCLLBEI573KHFZOWXSCJKIHI/)   \-Establishing the [fund](https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/new-fund-accelerate-m%C4%81ori-vaccinations) to accelerate Māori vaccination rates [earlier,](https://journal.nzma.org.nz/journal-articles/will-access-to-covid-19-vaccine-in-aotearoa-be-equitable-for-priority-populations-open-access)   \-Prioritising (instead of *rejecting*) health workers [for MIQ spaces,](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/126608859/miqueue-health-sector-mystified-over-struggle-to-get-staff-into-nz)   \-Preparing plans for a delta outbreak [earlier.](https://www.newsroom.co.nz/pro/documents-reveal-real-lack-of-preparedness-for-delta)    You then go on to say that people shouldn't ""request perfection"" because the government will be scared to make decisions if they fail or change course. That is just bonkers rhetoric. In that case we may as well abolish the opposition and stop demanding anything of the government.   They are elected to *make decisions*. The current government has an absolute majority. If they're scared to make decisions because of some backlash if they fail, then that in itself is a damning indictment on their ability to govern the country during a crisis.  A pandemic is hard to predict and difficult to respond to event. That does not automatically mean that the government has done all it can to the best of it's abilities.

210,5,1635590717,"The way I'm understanding it is this -   If your company chooses to randomly drug test you, they inform you of this at the time of an interview or it's written in to your contact. You consent to it and you've given informed consent. Also, under our employment laws, if you are found to have a positive test, the company has an obligation to help you get clean- rehab/counseling etc and readminiter a test in a certain time frame. If those actions fail or you decline, only then can you be terminated. And being impaired on the job is a massive risk to your immediate safety and the immediate safety of others. (Not saying covid isn't, this is just part of my understanding, I'm still going)   A lot of people I know, are feeling like with this vaccine, they're not informed enough for them to feel comfortable giving consent. Consent obtained by pressure, coersion, force or threat is *not* consent. And we actually have legal frame work for that (albeit in sexual assault cases, the same arguments can be made here)   There's also the waning efficacy argument and the fact that vaccinated people can still spread the virus - yes, I know its at a lower rate and that it mostly prevents people from serious illness etc, that's ab argument for another time - so just being vaccinated isn't going to be enough at some point. The vast majority of people who I know that don't want the vaccine would rather have an alternative such as rapid testing. It gives them, the employer and the customer base a lot more confidence than a vaccine certificate could because if the test is accurate enough, they're proven to be ""clean"" without having to undergo a medical procedure they don't want and don't feel capable of giving informed consent for.  And if the test comes back positive before the work day starts, they go home. Sick leave/ annual leave/ unpaid leave until they can produce a negative test.   The $120 million that's been spent trying to convince those who are adamant they don't want it could have been spent partly subsidizing rapid tests like the ones being used at middlemore hospital. If they don't want the vaccine which is free the alternative is that they can purchase their own tests (possibly partly subsidized as this would likely come under a health directive)   I honestly am concerned that the Vax certificate is flawed in that people may overlook mild symptoms because they're double jabbed and that increases the risk of the virus spreading. Those who are unvaccinated but willing to take a test every day, willing to purchase their tests don't deserve to be treated as second class citizens. They want to be a part of the community, want to work, to do the right thing but are uncomfortable with a forced medical procedure. I cant blame them for that.

216,4,1635465015,"&gt; You might believe the fiction that politicians are in charge but — to cite the Harold Macmillan cliché — the greatest influence on policy is events.  &gt;On that basis, ignore the details of what the Government says on any given day and plan for the new normal to arrive in weeks rather than months. You should be able to safely book your summer holiday, whether camping in Northland or skiing in St Moritz.  &gt;And while the weeks ahead will be tough — especially if you work at Middlemore Hospital — retailers can look forward to an excellent Christmas shopping season, and all other businesspeople to a 2022 undisturbed by lockdowns or other material restrictions.  &gt;Since Jacinda Ardern abandoned elimination on October 4 by announcing Auckland's move to level 3 the next day, a remorseless logic has been driving her decisions.  &gt;To her credit, Ardern is boldly going with the flow: abandoning her levels and steps in favour of the new traffic lights; introducing domestic vaccine passports; expanding compulsory vaccination to at least 40 per cent and perhaps the whole workforce; expanding the types of vaccines New Zealand recognises; planning to open all schools in two weeks; fast-tracking the approval and purchase of Pfizer's paediatric and booster vaccines plus Merck's new antiviral pill; moving yesterday towards abolishing managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ); and on track to abandon her own vaccination targets and internal borders by Christmas if that doesn't happen automatically under current policy.  &gt;The Prime Minister has no real choice. The conceit that we alone would beat Delta was just another manifestation of our naive national myth of Kiwi exceptionalism. Our Covid journey will ultimately follow roughly the same path as everywhere else.  &gt;Ardern was right to pursue elimination for as long as she did. It delivered fewer hospital admissions and deaths, and some near-normal times between the two big lockdowns while we waited for the vaccine.  &gt;**But when the new normal arrives, a million or so of us will get Covid each year, and everyone before too long. The only choice is whether you are vaccinated or unvaccinated, which in turn strongly influences whether you spend a few days in bed or less, or end up in hospital or worse.**  &gt;Whether she admits it or not, Ardern's failure to order vaccines in line with the rest of the developed world, and her decision to move to level 3 before near-universal vaccination, ensured hospital wards and MIQ facilities would be overwhelmed.  &gt;So it has transpired, with over 300 people with Covid already unable to be accommodated and living at home, hopefully with some medical care or at least a pulse oximeter. Soon it will be many more.  &gt;The forced shift to home-based care in turn made yesterday's MIQ decision unavoidable. It was impossible to justify sending home hundreds of non-vaccinated sick people, while forcing double-vaccinated Kiwis who had Covid months ago and are now testing negative into two weeks in MIQ.  &gt;Covid Minister Chris Hipkins said yesterday he plans for double-vaccinated healthy Kiwis to be allowed to avoid MIQ altogether in the first quarter of 2022, but political pressure will bring that forward to before Christmas. There will be no MIQ for double-vaxxed healthy Kiwis returning home from holidays abroad this January.  &gt;Expect the double-jabbed, negative-test rule to be extended to tourists and overseas students well ahead of the current timeline. Already, the Ministry of Education says the Government will allow 1000 foreign students into New Zealand next year, 400 of them pilot trainees as well as 300 university and 300 polytechnic students. Who knew that private flight schools had better lobbyists than the state tertiary institutions? Expect universities, polytechnics and secondary schools to redouble their advocacy in the next few weeks.  &gt;Led by the University of Auckland, all tertiary institutions will soon require all staff and students to be double-jabbed to step on campus. Even as the Government radically expands compulsory vaccination in the workforce, it will soon not be possible for young people to get any job requiring so much as a polytechnic certificate without first being double-jabbed.  &gt;Beehive strategists say the intention is that the legislation to be passed next month allowing employers to make vaccination a condition of employment will be written permissively so that, in practice, it covers almost everyone.  &gt;As Education Minister, Hipkins has already allowed senior secondary students back to school, and announced a target of November 15 for primary and intermediate schools.  &gt;Presumably year 9 and 10 students will be also be allowed back. While teachers are not legally required to be vaccinated by November 15, they can be given notice if they aren't in time for term 1.  &gt;For their younger students, MedSafe will formally decide when children under 12 can be vaccinated. But it is not unknown for senior Beehive staffers to explain to independent decision-makers what prime ministers think, just as a courtesy you understand.  &gt;With the politicians and bureaucrats having learned their lesson from their original failure to order vaccines, expect children aged 5 to 11 to start being jabbed in a few weeks.  &gt;Meanwhile, vaccination rates, including among Māori, continue to rise, especially now Wellington bureaucrats and District Health Boards (DHBs) are out of the way of local providers. Auckland is on track to meet the 90 per cent target around December 1, the date Ardern's opponents have nominated for Freedom Day. Expect her to adopt a Freedom Day by another name, whatever vaccination rates are in late November. The shops, bars and restaurants will re-open for the December peak.  &gt;Ardern also knows internal borders are unsustainable for much longer, and certainly unthinkable by mid-December. Even if vaccination rates in the Northland DHB haven't reached 90 per cent by Christmas, Ardern knows she cannot create economic misery in the poorest part of the country by preventing its tourism sector from operating through the summer.  &gt;The same applies to Coromandel, the Bay of Plenty, Taupō and other regions highly reliant on tourism. In any case, Aucklanders won't stand for not having a summer holiday after nearly four months of lockdown. The border between Auckland and Northland, including by sea, would become impossible to police.  &gt;Yes, Ardern's decisions mean the hospitals will be stretched and there will be Covid deaths, almost exclusively among the unvaxxed. But the path is now basically set. And much better we embrace the new normal before summer than delaying the inevitable transition until autumn or the winter.  Posted for the read.

266,3,1634938782,"&gt;A month ago, when Grant Robertson first confirmed the Government was planning to use certificates, he said they'd aim to introduce them at the start of November.        Two weeks later, Dr Ashley Bloomfield had a different date in mind. The vaccine certificates, he said, should be ready in ""late November"".   &gt;   &gt;Yesterday, the timeline appeared to change again.        ""From mid-December, everyone in New Zealand should be able to access a digital vaccination certificate,"" said the official Covid-19 website.        After the discrepancy in dates was questioned, the wording on the Covid-19 website was promptly changed.   &gt;   &gt;""From later this year, everyone in New Zealand should be able to access a digital vaccination certificate,"" it said.        Then, late last night the website changed again, this time to ""the end of November"".        So is it mid-November, late-November, or mid-December that vaccine certificates in New Zealand will be downloadable and fully functional, where an individual's QR code can be scanned and cross-checked against a national database while protecting their private medical information?   &gt;   &gt;I might be accused of splitting hairs except for a couple of reasons.        If we take the latest of those different dates and vaccine certificates aren't fully functional until mid-December, there's a chance Auckland's DHBs will reach the golden 90 per cent vaccination threshold before the certificates are ready to go.        But fundamentally, if you think I shouldn't be quibbling over four or six weeks, you're right!        It's astonishing New Zealand doesn't have a fully functional vaccine passport system already developed and tested. Almost every developed country has a system in place. Israel launched its vaccine passport system in February. New York introduced vaccine passports in March. As National's Chris Bishop pointed out yesterday, Cuba has a vaccine passport system. Burkina Faso has a vaccine passport system!        But as recently as the start of August, in an interview with the Herald's Claire Trevett, Jacinda Ardern ruled out using vaccine passports in New Zealand. This was at a time when New South Wales was already recording hundreds of new infections a day.        Naivety or hubris? Why wouldn't New Zealand need vaccine passports when everyone else did? What makes us so special?        At the very least, the delay points to complacency. The development of a domestic vaccine passport system should have been a priority from the moment we placed our order with Pfizer, even if it later proved New Zealand never needed to use it.        That vaccine certificates aren't already functional tells us officials did not sufficiently prepare for a scenario in which New Zealand couldn't eliminate the virus.        We've been caught flat-footed with vaccine certificates because we thought we were different to everyone else. We thought we were better.

Ignore anything about pilot group/trusted witness/unique code, it's not applicable right now.  My Covid Record is a work in progress. Right now it doesn't do much yet, but in the future it will provide an QR code (ie the vaccine passport), which will comply with European Union standards so it can be used locally and overseas.

My observations:  * Smart to tie MHA to this. Since a lot of people will want a vaccine certificate, this will encourage the uptake of MHA. Next service seems to be End of Life Choice. Would be interesting to see what other new digital health services this will enable. * Why do I have to make another login when I already have RealMe?  * Only available for 16+, will mean vaccine passports can't be enforced on the youth * Sign up documents include NZ Driver Licence or Citizenship Certificate or NZ/AU Passport or Birth Certificate. This will be problematic to certain sections of the population eg youth and elderly, people who can't drive, poor, new immigrants, etc. * RealMe Verified takes a few days to set up, and unless you have a NZ Passport or NZ Citizenship Certificate you'll need to go to an AA office which is not possible during Level 3-Step 1 * Each person needs their own email (important to know if you're helping family and neighbours to set up) * Site works well on desktop and mobile * Quite detailed vaccine records including site (left arm) and method (injection into muscle).

339,0,1632887802,"&gt;New Zealand’s vaccination rate has fallen off a cliff.   &gt;   &gt;Just 12,641 people got a first dose on Monday, the lowest weekday total since mid-July, when most people under the age of 65 were not yet eligible for a shot.   &gt;   &gt;This isn’t a blip: the average daily rate has dropped to about 20,000 a day in the last week, less than half the lockdown-fuelled rate of 55,000 managed earlier this month.   &gt;   &gt;And it looks to be getting worse, too. The number of people booked in for a vaccine has barely moved in the last week, growing by just 50,000.   &gt;   &gt;The spike in people getting their second dose will mask how bad this situation is over the next few weeks, but those people were locked-in six weeks ago – if New Zealand wants to grow its vaccinated population to the kind of levels where it can safely lift restrictions, it will need to get far more people without a single jab signing up for one.   &gt;   &gt;If bookings continue to grow at that kind of rate, it would take months to get vaccine coverage up to that 90 per cent of the eligible population the prime minister keeps talking about. Currently, just 75 per cent of the 12+ population has a jab, while 78 per cent are booked. If bookings keep growing by just 50,000 a week it would take another 13 weeks to even get 90 per cent booked in – that’s the end of December.   &gt;   &gt;Even if we ignore bookings and just assume the Government keeps giving our first doses at its current anaemic rate, which seems unlikely given the continued drop off through the last three weeks, then it would take until November 1 for 90 per cent of eligible Kiwis to get a first dose.   &gt;   &gt;This problem is not unique to New Zealand and was entirely foreseeable. About 64 per cent of the entire country has had a single jab or more. Many other countries are stuck around here in the 60s. The United States has been here for about a month. Germany and the United Kingdom stalled out a bit higher, but not much higher.   &gt;   &gt;That doesn’t mean it is impossible: Several other democratic countries have got rates far higher – notably Portugal, Denmark, and Uruguay. Our Government should be studying their approaches closely.   &gt;   &gt;Notably, Denmark and Portugal have set clear vaccine targets, rewarding citizens with loosened controls once they are reached. They have also been very comfortable restricting people without either a vaccination certificate or a recent negative test from attending bars and restaurants.   &gt;   &gt;These tools appear to be working far better than small-dollar incentives or large lotteries attempted by several US states, and suggested by former prime minister Sir John Key over the weekend.   &gt;   &gt;Down here in New Zealand, the Government has finally promised a digital vaccine certificate within a month. But it’s still somewhat wishy-washy on how much these could be used to restrict people from their workplaces or from venues.   &gt;   &gt;Ministers need to be much clearer and give private companies some certainty.   &gt;   &gt;Restaurants and employers will be understandably wary of getting too far ahead of the public or the legal sphere on this one. Most Kiwis agree that border workers should be forced into either getting a jab or being fired – but it’s unclear whether or not they would support such a policy being applied to all jobs that require close contact indoors.   &gt;   &gt;Similarly, there is a risk of going too far when barring people from certain venues. Sure, it seems reasonable to bar someone without a jab (or negative test) from a crowded concert venue: But what about a super-market? Or a church? People do have a right to both refuse medical treatment and participate in something like normal life.   &gt;   &gt;Epidemiologist Michael Baker’s suggestion that Air NZ bar the unvaccinated from domestic flights could cause a huge amount of drama with the vocally unvaccinated. It also assumes that those not getting the vaccine are flying around the country with regularity.   &gt;   &gt;This is the kind of problem only strong central leadership can fix. Some idea of light at the end of the tunnel might help.   &gt;   &gt;Even with clear targets and strong incentives to get vaccinated, some people will be hard to reach. This won’t be because they are dyed-in-the-wool anti-vaxxers, it will be because they are hard to reach with most things. About a million people don’t vote every election.   &gt;   &gt;They are counted on the census only because Statistics NZ makes painstaking efforts to knock on every door in the country. These people have every right to not really pay attention to public life – that’s the beauty of a stable democracy – but the Government should be mimicking the census and going door-to-door to reach them.   &gt;   &gt;None of these interventions will be silver bullets, and we may never reach the top of the tables for vaccinations. But New Zealand is a strongly-centralised rich country that manages to get close to 100 per cent of its babies inoculated. Trust in our institutions is generally high.   &gt;   &gt;The Government has political cover and all the money it needs to run a pretty-extensive catch-up plan for this last portion of the community, with carrots and sticks aplenty. It should get to it.  An important piece I feel. Especially off the back of todays case numbers. ""Living with covid"" as much as I hate that phrase, is something that we're going to have to seriously consider sooner than we thought. Yes the pandemic is dynamic, unpredictable, and rapidly evolving, and expecting a concrete long-term plan isn't realistic. But we need more certainty on what we know for sure. And we know for sure that we're going to be living with covid in the community.
