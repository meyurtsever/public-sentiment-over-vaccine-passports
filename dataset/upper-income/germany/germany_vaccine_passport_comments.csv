25,0,1638521289,"Officially the Janssen vaccine is not given in Germany any more because it barely works against the Delta variant (and probably not at all against the Omicron variant).

Which is totally legal, don't get me wrong, but the state of Germany, which procures all the vaccines in this situation, does not deliver new Janssen vaccines to pharmacies and doctors any more.

Get an mRNA vaccine that actually boosts your immunity and gives you protection.  And yes, as a German resident you are eligible to get vaccinated here.

Mind you, Germany is in the middle of the booster campaign right now so everyone is scrambling to get a booster shot, which means most places that offer vaccines are completely booked and you might need some luck to get a regular appointment.

I came to Frankfurt at the beginning of this month under this exception and had no problems (but they sure looked over the details before I got on the flight), however I had all the paperwork they mention and they can see by my passport that I was here a couple months ago (I'm honestly not sure if that was an important part of me getting in or if they didn't even check it).   Keep in mind that if she goes to visit you, she'll have to quarantine when she gets back, so that makes quick trips really difficult. For a 10 day trip she'd have to take at least 15 days off work, assuming she could quarantine for 5 days and take a test, and that's assuming you live in a US state that doesn't require quarantine.   What will things look like in August? That's anyone's guess. I'd say either buy a ticket that you can change or just wait. Hopefully there will be an exception for those who can prove they have the vaccine, I would guess it's likely, but I don't know that I'd go buying plane tickets based on that.  On the plus side I just bought my return ticket for August and flights are very reasonably priced right now.

I have had high hopes to be able to come to visit my family this summer but when I got the text from my German friends saying that the vaccine is suspended and that people can fly to  Majorca again - I lost my shit....  Who the hell is in charge here? What is worse - a few people with a blood cloth or a continuing lockdown that will harm everyone? And to be clear,,, I would take AZ right away despite the risk... And even if I get a broadcloth - yeah it would suck but I would also know that I helped a lot of other people by just taking it..  Rn, I am just happy to be abroad. COVID is being handled way better and multiple vaccines are available for people above 60.

Personally, as long as you trust the vaccine, I think it would be a mistake not to get it with how slow things are going here. Imo worst case, the EU doesn't recognize your vaccine and they do have some kind of vaccine passport so you get another one here once they actually get around to vaccinating everyone.

I don't remember all the details, but Iceland already introduced advantages for vaccinated people and tourism-dependent countries like Spain, Greece, Portugal are pushing hard for such document. ""Shitstorm"" is such an overexaggeration, maybe just ""discontent"" from some people/countries.  Note that a coordinated EU-wide vaccine passport won't come any time soon, rather starting from summer. And even then, people will have the chance to use negative test results instead but I don't know how that'll work out.  https://www.adac.de/news/corona-impfung-reise-urlaub/  https://www.merkur.de/reise/corona-impfpass-urlaub-2021-eu-reise-beschraenkungen-sommer-zr-90176223.html",germany,t5_2qi4z,/r/germany/comments/m42qfq/question_regarding_getting_vaccinated_from_outside/gqsfesh/
