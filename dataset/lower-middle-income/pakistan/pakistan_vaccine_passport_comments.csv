3,0,1628052275,"Your numbers don't make sense.   The UK was one of the worst hit. There were 5.9 million cases and 130k deaths.   Pakistan's population is at least three times higher than the UK, yet the confirmed cases were 1million and 23k confirmed deaths. The infection rate is 7 people per 100k.  Pakistan was able to control the spread due to sensible precautions taken. So much so, that it's ranked the third best in terms of control only after new Zealand - in the world. This was all achieved without a vaccine.  Enforced vaccinations, coupled with a passport to confirm you are vaccinated is unreasonable. So people who had other vaccinations such as polio or malaria have to carry a passport?   If you support the right for someone else to determine what is put into your body - and for it to determine if you're able to participate in society, what else are you in favour of? What else would you force upon the populace? What else would exclude them from?  We don't have to talk about my mother or anyone else's. Every person who died would likely have had someone who cared for them, it's beside the point.",pakistan,t5_2qh89,/r/pakistan/comments/owtwif/oh_no_the_tyranny/h7n4xdi/

I too called gerrys to ask for the pfizer vaccine but the thing is that they have a I must say a weird policy to only vaccinate those outsiders who are travelling to either the UK or US as students. Finally the moderna vaccine reached the expo center which is basically same as the pfizer vaccine(m-RNA based). There they just asked me for the copies of my visa, passport and the CNIC after which I was vaccinated by the moderna one. So yeah id say leave the pfizer vaccine and do try to get vaccinated by the moderna one.",pakistan,t5_2qh89,/r/pakistan/comments/oo7fxp/pzifer/h604kd3/

However, I don't have my acceptance yet since the schools that I'm interested in have yet to open their application portal for the spring intake. I have my passport ready would that be enough to show proof to be elgible for Moderna?   I am a bit skeptical about sinovac because its literally been banned everywhere. Even the middle east and EU are not allowing people who have gotten sinvoc into their countries. And since WHO has advised against getting two different vaccines, I think it would be much better to just get a vaccine thats accepted internationally.",pakistan,t5_2qh89,/r/pakistan/comments/oo7fxp/pzifer/h5wr1c6/
