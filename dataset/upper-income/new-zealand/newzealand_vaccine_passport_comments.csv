They should have pushed vaccines earlier to higher risk groups.  By your argument we can justify an inconvenience to another person if it saves their life. I agree. This is a reasonable cost, if it's minor and I also expect it to make sense and be voluntary. However, much more than a minor inconvenience is not a good idea. It's simply not clearly beneficial to use a coercive (i.e. harnessing the force of the state) method for enforcing this. A restaurant being fined 20k is in my view disproportionate to the risk, and heavy handed. No one wants people to die... (do I need to even say this?) but a vaccine passport is --not-- going to prevent that at this point... in a town with zero covid community cases it does not make sense to be using the current approach. To suggest that we hold off everyones lives so that people can live in a bubble is not realistic, and it's frankly pretty selfish.   If your dad wants to minimise his risk then he should get the vaccine (and booster), and should also avoid smoking, should exercise regularly and eat a plant based diet. Obesity is a key risk factor so I hope he's been exercising for the last 18 months so that he is less likely to end up in ICU... Do you catch my drift here? The current narrative is not focused on individual responsibility, but rather the sacrifices that every has to make for high risk people. Maybe I'm high risk, there's no point in including my own medical history here. It doesn't change my view point here. Protect the vulnerable and incompetent, reduce your own factors for severe disease where able, and proportionally to your own assessment of the risks from covid. Vaccination appears to be very effective against the more deadly strains but of less help against omicron (which is weak anyway). Effective social distancing helps. Signs and QR contact tracing are only as helpful as the rules and enforcement. The way we use them currently is stupid, and fining this restaurant is more of Jacinda's unnecessary bullshit.

Consider an unrepentant paedophile who is sexually attracted to children and refuses to participate in therapy to change this.  They were not convicted of a crime, however because it is known they are a higher risk of causing harm to children than the general public, there has been restrictions put on where they are allowed to go, and who they can interact with to decrease the chance of harm.  In this scenario, you are arguing that while you aren't attracted to children, you hate the thought that someone who is a greater risk of preying on children being kept apart and not being allowed to go to swimming pools and schools where they are near children.  The vaccine passport is meant to serve 2 purposes - to keep a physical separation for the purposes of protection, and by the fact people want to avoid that separation, to encourage them to get vaccinated and thus remove the increased risk which warrants that protection.  I understand the idea that from a moral standpoint it doesn't seem right that there are limitations being put on some people...but it's intended to protect people from legitimate medical risk.  We pretty much have to be around strangers, but we don't have to be around strangers who also have considerably-higher risk of being infected and infectious.  From a practical standpoint, so long as we can't vaccinate all children against the virus (and children can expose adults and higher-risk people to the virus) we are no-where near the requirements for herd immunity where it would be acceptable from a standpoint of medical risk...to increase the risk for us all by removing the location restrictions from those who represent that higher risk.  There are probably more at-risk people in NZ who are immunosuppressed or have other reasons why Covid would cause them imminent danger who would feel the need to restrict themselves to protect themselves....than the number of anti-vaxxers who would benefit from being allowed to join them in closed, indoor, higher-risk locations.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/rhbsgx/covid19_milestone_90pc_of_new_zealanders_are_now/hoqcxuh/

The people without vaccine require more social distancing to reduce the spread thus different restrictions apply.   This is all the light system does.

201,0,1638063022,"&gt; So as I suspected, you're not looking at the whole picture. &gt;  &gt; Freedoms are defined by laws and such laws tend to be delicate. Adding something like a vaccine pass that allows organisations to block service to specific individuals needs to go through the proper checks and balances to make sure its limited to just what is required, doesn't over step and doesn't have loopholes that could be used for other purposes.   None of this happened though. In fact, you have the facts pretty much exactly opposite to what actually happened.   First factual error: The law had not even been drafted at the time the government commissioned the vaccine passport system. This is because it's not actually necessary to decide the *legal* details of the implementation at the time you make the app - you can develop the app first, and then decide when and where it must be used. Conclusion: The government waiting for long legal processes was not the cause of our slowness.    Secondly, when the legislation was eventually introduced - on 23rd November - it *bypassed* all the normal checks and balances. It passed less than 24 hours after it was first introduced. In the words of Dr Dean Knight (Assoc. Prof. Victoria University, member of NZ Centre for Public Law, co-chair of Australasian chapter of the International Society of Public Law, executive committee member of the Law and Society Association of Australia and New Zealand (LSAANZ), editorial committee of the NZ Journal of Public and International Law):  &gt;It is a constitutional disgrace that the legislation mandating this vaccination regime is being passed urgently this week, without provision for prior/adequate consultation on the legislative framework. Whether you support the new Covid protection framework (which I do) or not, legislative change seriously implicating rights like this needs much more time to breathe, to be interrogated and for its legitimacy to be built through dialogue. *From a quick look, also concerning is the framework is empowering only, leaving much of the detail of the protection framework/vaccination mandates to be settled in Covid-19 orders made by the minister. Again, quite concerning - esp given the novelty of the measures* ...That perhaps a suite of further judicial review applications challenging vax mandates in the new year... Joy. 🙄  He goes on to list a variety of other problems with the rushed process in [this 56 tweet long thread \(make sure you scroll all the way to the top\)](https://twitter.com/drdeanknight/status/1463200066592591878). I think an esteemed public law expert describing something as a ""constitution disgrace"" ought to trigger some alarm bells, and clearly indicates checks and balances have not been followed.    The part in italics is important and I'll return to that later, but first lets look at a non-comprehensive list of other public law experts who have critiqued the government in incredibly strong terms for *bypassing* all the checks and balances that they could have gone through if they had started things earlier:  * [NZ Human Rights Commission](https://www.hrc.co.nz/news/scrutiny-and-public-input-needed-urgently-new-covid-19-legislation-says-human-rights-commission/) * [New Zealand Law Society](https://www.lawsociety.org.nz/news/law-society-statements/law-society-raises-concerns-about-passage-of-covid-19-response-vaccinations-legislation-act-2021/) * [Trevor Mallard \(A Labour MP! and speaker of the house\)](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/127082246/speaker-trevor-mallard-lashes-government-for-urgently-passing-covid19-law?cid=app-iPhone) * [Geoff McLay \(Prof. Victoria University, Former Law Commissioner, Former Chair of the Legislation Design Advisory Committee, Editor of NZ Law Reports\)](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/127082246/speaker-trevor-mallard-lashes-government-for-urgently-passing-covid19-law?cid=app-iPhone) * Every party in parliament other than Labour * [Eddie Clark](https://twitter.com/Publicwrongs/status/1463230874695061506) (Senior Lecturer Victoria University)  Regarding the italics: One of the issues Dr Knight raises is that the legislation that passed is actually incredibly incomplete - the existing legislation doesn't actually contain most of the framework, but just gives the minister of covid-19 response sweeping powers to implement a whole bunch of orders that will eventually become the framework. To be clear, the parts of the law that mandate the use of the vaccine certificates cannot have gone through checks and balances, because those parts of the laws do not exist yet - they exist only when Chris Hipkins issues a public health order.   This is known as secondary legislation. According to the government's own legislation advisory committee, the framework would clearly be more appropriate for primary legislation:  &gt; As a general rule, matters of significant policy and principle should be included in an Act. Secondary legislation should generally deal with minor or technical matters of implementation and the operation of the Act ... The following matters should generally (or in some cases always) be addressed in primary legislation:  &gt;* matters of significant policy; * matters significantly affecting fundamental human rights; * the creation of significant public powers such as search and seizure or confiscation of property;    - http://www.ldac.org.nz/guidelines/legislation-guidelines-2021-edition/issues-particularly-relevant-to-empowering-secondary-legislation-2/chapter-14/  I'm sorry, but if you think the reason our response has been slow is because the government is going through all the checks and balances, you just haven't been paying attention.    &gt;There's also the fact that it's revealing medical information so that needs to be checked too.  That's a really, really good reason to sign the contract and get everything in motion *earlier*, so developers aren't rushed. More development time = more time can be allocated to testing to find and quash security issues.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/r34wd0/jacinda_ardern_says_new_zealand_is_prepared_for/hmcgrxx/

Many ordinary people believed this vaxxed or un vaxxed, many experts also acknowledged this possibility too. It is the media that has unnecessary delivered 'anti vaxxers' a complete victory on these topics throught their reckless coverage.   As for vaccine passports not being 'new', I do disagree there.  A vaccine passport on this scale and with this wide of a reach with consequences as sever as they are under this new framework, there really is no historical equivalent in my view and certainly in theirs too.   The way I see it, there are two factors at play with these Covid-19 restrictions and either side of the argument is choosing to deny the existence of one of them. 1 is public health and 2, is about government controll. Most of the 'anti vax' or 'anti Covid vax' groups see all of this purely as an attempt by governments to gain more power and use said power to fundamentally change society, many believe that this has nothing to do with public health because they they think Covid is either fake, or a slightly bad flu season.   For the staunchly pro vax groups (yes they exist and they're arguably just as bad as anti vaxxers with regards to misinformation and constant moaning), they believe this is all about public health, and that there are no opportunistic power grabs going on, no abuse going on, no sinister underlying motives. It's all rather naive in my view to see governmentsas this benevolent organization that will always has our best intentions at heart. They have a level of trust in their government that anti vaxxers don't share, so while they're willing to giver government the benefit of the doubt  anti vaxxers aren't.

The fact they invented some local vaccine passport system, which is now reduced to security theatre is embarassing for the government.

363,0,1636481362,"I'm in a similar boat to you.   Vaccinated myself but disagree with mandates for a few reasons:  1. I'm not convinced that the ""social tensions"" that arise from locking \~10% of the adult population out of employment, recreational opportunities etc are worth it for the extra percentage of vaccine uptake. There will be collateral damage here that is hard to quantify and make take some time to fully make its effects felt. For example mum and dad are anti-vax so lose their jobs ... the kids - through no fault of their own - experience a substantial decline in standard of living, opportunities etc. No doubt this also risks fuelling extreme behaviour from some (take away people's ability to feed themselves and see how they can start to behave) It may feel cathartic now to see anti-vaxxers be punished, locked out of society and so on, but I believe in time we will see that as having been a bad idea as the ""long tail"" of effects from this is felt.  2. Looking at health expert insight from European countries like Germany, there seems evidence the Covid passport system is potentially worsening Covid's spread. This is because the vaccinated believe they are ""invincible"" (or at least 'the average Joe' does because he/she has been sold the idea that Covid vaccines are infallible) so they drop all other protective measures e.g. frequent hand washing, mask wearing, social distancing etc. The layperson still believes that Covid vaccines work like the ones you had has a kid - i.e. you take the vaccine and then you cannot really get infected or transmit the disease. However, Covid vaccines seem to work more like 'symptom mitigators' (at least after a short while) so you can still get spread amongst the vaccinated. Look at Waterford County in Ireland for example - around 99.5% of adults are fully-vaccinated there, but they have some of the worst case growth in all of Ireland. At the same time the unvaccinated will be driven underground to meet in private, where there is far more chance that Covid spreads aggressively through that community. 3. There are a number of promising treatment products (e.g. new Pfizer pill) coming down the pipeline. These should help to keep hospitalisations lower, and ultimately may prove more effective than vaccination.  4. The implementation here seems arse about face. Isn't the point that once we hit 90%, modelling has projected that we won't see the health system overrun? Therefore, once we hit 90% (which is when the traffic light system is meant to kick in with the Covid passport) why do we need the restrictions in the first place?",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/qq82bl/important_update_daily_covid19_discussion_thread/hjyp95d/

In both cases I can't blame them. When the system uses the carrot and the stick at the same time making the default choice of being un vaccinated the wrong choice I can see why they get upset.

So once the population immunity gets to 90%, I as a business owner, must interrogate the vaccination status of my patrons, or I will be unable to operate effectively.

But that wouldn't necessarily have helped with ICU capacity, as it takes years of experience to get someone ready to be an ICU nurse.  Yes, they could have started on that, and they did begin an overhaul of the health care system, but they still have problem with horribly low wages and understaffing, which could certainly have been better.

There are numerous issues with this approach.  The passport (to be released next month) will be a separate QR code that contains a digital signature that is cryptographically signed by MoH. The validators will scan the signature and use public/private key encryption to validate that the certificate was created specifically by the MoH. That is all that would be needed to verify a person's status.

The vaccine has been properly tested through all the same steps that any other vaccine would have to go through but its been done quickly because large resources have been thrown at it. That does not mean its been rushed.  But mainly, there’s been around a billion doses administered across the vaccine groups and the adverse reactions have put it 100 times safer than getting Covid across the board. It’s not new any more.  It’s not sane to think that Covid without the vaccine is a better option than Covid with the vaccine, both on an individual or society wide view.  You trust that people on the road most likely have some sort of training and licence to show they probably wont kill or main you or your loved ones.

584,12,1635066062,"Happy to engage in a conversation on this, as I have been really struggling to find people who wish to discuss actual facts and how they are arrived at. As opposed to the rhetoric which seems to be really derisive among so many these days.  Because I certainly don’t claim to have any sort of medical training, you will have to bear with me on some of my questions. - 31 were unlikely to be caused by Covid. How was this conclusion arrived at, and who came to this conclusion . What is the basis or parameters that the MoH uses to define this? - 26 do not have sufficient information for a conclusion. Who arrived at that decision, and based on what? It seems strange that in this current Covid aware environment, that anyone who passed away, within a short time of receiving medical treatment, that the information required about these situations is unavailable. Our hospital aren’t currently so stretched, that basic and important reporting isn’t being performed. - the 6.5 million doses given out , 70% of those its a second dose, so your maths needs to be changed to reflect that, your maths is based on people and then you base it on doses. You also havent allowed for the number of people in that 50 000 who dispite being vaccinated will still die. It needs to be in there for accuracy.  However even when you account for that I agree that the numbers still stack up for vaccinating over unvaxxed. Across the vast majority of the age groups. But i still believe all we can do is put the information in front of people, so that informed choices can be made by all of the hesitating ones, rather than the current course of continued, them and us policy’s.  You very obviously have an interest or strong knowledge on this subject, so I would also be interested in your thoughts around the vaccine itself.  From what information I have managed to gather and read (some of it I am still having to reread to make sure I have understood things correctly) the Pfizer vaccine seems to be the pick of the bunch for results available at this point. It seems to have performed the best in both reducing the likely hood of vaccinated people catching Covid and also when vaccinated people do catch it, the Pfizer vaccinated people seem to have the least amount of hospital admissions and severe symptoms. So from what i can see our government has made the right choice on which vaccine to go with.  Once I started looking at the vaccine itself (so far I have had a couple of discussions with Doctors I know, who both work in ICU units in Chch and Wellington, and then since those discussions I have used a couple of different sources to try and research the chemistry behind the vaccine, mainly the British medical journal and then links to different studies from this source. If any of the questions i am about to ask you dont sound right or you think i have got it wrong let me know and i will find the links i used to get this info). I would also add that i fully understand a lot of the work around this particular vaccine has had to be forced and rushed to allow whats effectively the pick of the bunch to be out there and being used.  The part of the vaccine I am struggling to fully understand is the PEG2000. I understand its the delivery system for the spike, that activates our immune system, to combat the virus. If i understand things correctly, the issue they have is the spike only has a very short life span, once its in our blood, and generally will be dead (i presume killed by our existing antibodies, but i am only guessing at that) with in a very short time of entering our system, it needs to survive for 2 to 3 weeks to do its job properly. The PEG2000 coats the spike in a protective coating to allow it to survive for the required time before breaking down naturally in our body. PEG2000 is polyethylene glycol . Polyethylene glycol is manufactured from polypropelene glycol. It’s manufactured by adding ethylene oxide with the polypropelene glycol. The byproduct of this chemical reaction is a number of extremely carcinogenic components. These are then removed and you are left with the polyethylene glycol. This has a number of uses in the medical industry, but has been predominantly used as a laxative, taken in oral form.  The main use it has had (prior to being used in the current Pfizer vaccine) in a intravenous use, has been used as a delivery system for some very strong chemotherapy drugs. When the British medical journal decided to run some trials on the effects of PEG2000 when used in a intravenous form, the only use was for delivery of chemo drugs. The conclusion they came to (released in June 2019 you can find it on their web site) was that it worked very effectively in allowing the clinicians to deliver the correct drugs to the intended target in the body. However they also put a rather significant disclaimer with it. They also found that due to the large amount of damage done to the patient by the chemo drug itself, it was impossible to tell if any of the issues were caused by the PEG2000 or the chemo drug. They concluded that while it looked promising a lot more work was required to ascertain what the medium and long term effects of this chemical will be on our bodies. They also mentioned that Quality control in the manufacturing process was going to be critical, as even trace amounts of the carcinogenic byproducts from manufacturing would be deadly with a number of different cancers particularly lymphatic cancers.  By necesity there hasn’t been time to complete any of these trials. So effectively we are Guinea pigs for this delivery system, rather than it going through the standard medical trial system.  Pfizers have been forced to ramp up their manufacturing enormously to allow them to try and supply world wide demand. What has been done to ensure a private company that is profit focused, is also totally committed to a QC system to ensure that during this enormous and no doubt challenging manufacturing ramp up process that QC isn’t suffering, as obviously the long term down sides could be very significant.  Again I am not saying that the current vaccine has these carcinogenic by products or that the PEG2000 is going to cause us issues. However i also cant get any powers to be or people in control of our response to engage on these issues either. It’s always either ignored, or i am given the answer that these are things that are at a higher level and i dont need to know about it, we must just trust the powers to be.  I am sure you can understand that answering questions that people have, with those type of responses, only makes most people want to find out more information.  For the record I am vaccinated for the following - Hepatitis A and B - Cholera - TB - Polio - yellow fever - Tetanus I spent 10 years living in different parts of Africa, and had to be vaccinated for all of these items, I still have my international vaccine passport. I experienced two Cholera outbreaks in the place i lived and saw the devastation this created on the unvaccinated. We also had to constantly be aware of hepatitis outbreaks in the water. So I believe myself to be far from a anti vaxxer (most of the ones I have ever met, are mad). My concerns are around the speed this has been brought to being considered safe. I totally understand we needed something to combat what has been sweeping the world, but it worries me that these basic questions I have, I am really struggling to get straight answers on.

594,6,1634948562,"A LETTER TO OUR PRIME MINISTER...   Dear Jacinda,   I am a New Zealander...a mother and a grandmother.   The closest i have been to you was when we jigged side by side in the VIP area of a U2 concert a couple of years ago.  I remember thinking how tiny and pretty you were.   I am a sensitive empath, and watching the pain in your eyes as you comforted the bereaved and traumatised after the mosque massacre, and White Island...i thought i recognised the same in you.   I know your Misinformation Officer will quickly find this post and hopefully share it with you...   I am taking it upon myself to share a grassroots snapshot in time, of the immense suffering so many of your people are enduring right now.   I host a community of nearly 35,000 New Zealanders whose lives have been changed by the Covid 19 vaccine.   Many who gather here are living with the daily legacy of suffering serious adverse reactions to our ""safe and effective"" covid solution.   Some are paralysed or have lost their health and vitality as a result of a stroke, heart attack, blood clot or myocarditis after their jab.   Others are dealing with a paralysed face, or ongoing extreme exhaustion, crippling pain or daily headaches that see them confined to bed for weeks on end.  When they try to share their story (as many thousands tried to on your recent face book post), they are smashed with angry vitriol...cries of ""misinformation"" and ""antivaxer""...even though they were ""pro vax"" enough to roll up their sleeve for the needle.   Having unexpectedly created a safe place for these marginalised and injured to gather, gives me daily insight into a New Zealand story the likes of which most unwitting Kiwi's have no awareness of.  All they hear every day is ""safe and effective....and they trust you and believe it.   The personal interactions i have with these families will leave a permanent heavy record in my heart.    I often think of the family whose beautiful brilliant medical specialist daughter is left permanently crippled by her post jab stroke.    Or the 22 year old woman who had to learn to walk and talk again after her stroke, following the jab she didnt want to have, but gave in to, in order to keep her job.   The family just 3 weeks ago who are wracked with trauma and grief after their precious 14 year old son collapsed dead in their garden, 3 days after his jab.    I have literally hundreds of such stories to share with you....as do the many who tried, unsuccessfully, to do so on your recent face book post.   You wont see a single one of them on the 6 o'clock news, the 1 o'clock update or the front page of the Herald.    Of course i realise that the vast majority of Kiwis will have their jab and have nothing more than a sore arm...but for many others life is changed and these broken Kiwis (who did the right thing!!) deserve our compassionate acknowledgement and care, not our scorn and disbelief.   And now there is a new tsunami of grief and suffering growing....the thousands of New Zealanders who are now faced with a choice they believed would never be forced upon them.    Do they take a jab, that for a myriad of reasons they have chosen not to have....or do they lose their job, vocation, career of decades?   While some will find the fear of unemployment and financial destitution enough to drag them, kicking and screaming to the vaccine tent...   For others, no amount of pressure, coercion or personal cost will be enough to wrestle a consent from their arm.  I have received hundreds of messages from these soon to be unemployed experts.    We are set to loose literally thousands of years of vocational experience from the New Zealand work force.  Doctors, nurses, teachers, psychiatrists, midwives and more.  Yes even an Orthopedic Surgeon and a Forensic Psychiatrist will be walking.  Some who are new to their careers and still paying off student loans....others with 20 or 30 years of valuable experience.   To those who have already had their jab, this might seem pure insanity.  Why would a professional with everything to lose, not just simply call in to the vax centre at the end of a work shift, and be done with the turmoil, pressure and angst?   I'll share just a tiny few of the myriad reasons these incredible people have shared with me.   The reasons can be grouped, and the first group hinges on TRUST.   Try as they might, some just cannot rationalise their way into a place of trusting either Pfizer,  or you and our Government.   They struggle to believe that the largest corporate and pharmaceutical felons in history can just be ""trusted"" with a rapidly developed, novel technology, medical product with absolutely ZERO long term safety data.    They also struggle with knowing that the contract our Government signed with Pfizer is confidential, and includes (this much we know) 100% liability protection for Pfizer.    These injured Kiwi's I've spoken about...if they are lucky their financial care will come from ACC (its not a given though).  That's us.  The tax payers.  An ""all care, no responsibility"" contract with a pharmaceutical company with a track record like Pfizer, simply does not inspire confidence in those who do their due diligence.   Others of these smart and educated professionals (including many medics) have spent many hours reading the clinical trial papers, following the government adverse reaction (and efficacy) databases around the world.   They are deeply concerned by what they see. Unprecedented serious injury and death, the likes of which have never been witnessed with a vaccine before.  With the exception of the many times inflated risk of heart inflammation in young males, the other serious injuries (or worse) seem to be randomly meted out as a form of medical Russian Roulette.   There is another group of soon to be unemployed, who have health issues that in any ""ordinary"" times, would see them exempted or even contraindicated from receiving this vaccine.  Long histories of blood clots, heart attacks, neurodegeneration conditions, and yes even previous severe and life threatening allergic reactions.   Instead they find themselves mandated, terrorised and terrified....including those who nearly died from their first dose, and are simply told they MUST have their second dose in a hospital with a crash cart and a resuscitation team at hand.   Then comes the group, often also encompassing the first two groups, who will walk away from their career as a stand for medical freedom.    These people believe that capitulating against their will to take a medical intervention, with unprecedented evidence of damage from around the world, is the greater of two evils.   Those with intelligence have so many unanswered questions...   Why do they not have the option of presenting a negative saliva test twice a week to ensure they are safe in the work place? (firstly....why do we not have $20 saliva tests available like the rest of the world?)   Why is an ""immunity passport"" based on evidence of covid antibodies from previous infection, not enough to safely keep their job?   Why has our Government put no effort into providing us with an effective Early Treatment Outpatient program such as that used with overwhelming success by Dr Peter McCullough or Dr Zelenko?  Instead those in MIQ are offered panadol while they wait to see if their infection will lead them to ICU.   Why are we not checking the vitamin D status of every man woman and child in the land, and providing them with safe and effective doses of vitamin D...now that we know so clearly that low vitamin D makes us a sitting target for both infection and a poor outcome (and we have endemic vitamin D deficiency in NZ with our ""sun smart"" messaging).   Why have we not used the last 20 months to educate, empower and lead our nation into a better state of health....starting with sharing the brutal truth that obesity greatly increases your risk of ICU and death.   Why have you done everything in your power to block our access to Ivermectin when the evidence of both the safety and efficacy for prevention and treatment of Covid is overwhelmingly positive?  Why are we not having any national debate and discussion around the risk/benefit analysis of vaccinating our children? New Zealanders have simply not been informed that their children face virtually no risk of a poor outcome from covid (unless their child is already severely health compromised).  They are similarly unaware that their children face very real risks from taking the vaccine, including up to 25 times the usual risk of heart inflammation (young males), along with its potentially life shortening consequences.   Why do most New Zealanders not understand that as double vaccinated they can still both contract and transmit covid, get seriously ill from covid and die of covid.    We just have to look at the heavily vaccinated countries like Singapore, Israel and UK, to see that it will take much more than this ""leaky"" vaccine to put an end to our misery.   Why have New Zealanders not been told that the vaccine passport they covet, will likely disappear into thin air if they refuse to consent to a booster every six months in order to be considered ""fully vaccinated""...along with the repeated re exposure to serious health risks.   I think enough has been said.    Your people are hurting....the vaccine injured or bereaved; the mandated and disillusioned, frightened and no longer trusting; and all those who have chosen (for a myriad of rational reasons) to decline the jab, and are now vilified, attacked, belittled second rate citizens in their own country.   Right now our nation has never felt more divided.    Mental health has never felt more thread bare.  And never before have more questions been left unanswered.   Jacinda...   Its not too late for you to show the same compassion we witnessed as you embraced the traumatised Muslims at the mosque.

631,23,1634938782,"&gt;A month ago, when Grant Robertson first confirmed the Government was planning to use certificates, he said they'd aim to introduce them at the start of November.        Two weeks later, Dr Ashley Bloomfield had a different date in mind. The vaccine certificates, he said, should be ready in ""late November"".   &gt;   &gt;Yesterday, the timeline appeared to change again.        ""From mid-December, everyone in New Zealand should be able to access a digital vaccination certificate,"" said the official Covid-19 website.        After the discrepancy in dates was questioned, the wording on the Covid-19 website was promptly changed.   &gt;   &gt;""From later this year, everyone in New Zealand should be able to access a digital vaccination certificate,"" it said.        Then, late last night the website changed again, this time to ""the end of November"".        So is it mid-November, late-November, or mid-December that vaccine certificates in New Zealand will be downloadable and fully functional, where an individual's QR code can be scanned and cross-checked against a national database while protecting their private medical information?   &gt;   &gt;I might be accused of splitting hairs except for a couple of reasons.        If we take the latest of those different dates and vaccine certificates aren't fully functional until mid-December, there's a chance Auckland's DHBs will reach the golden 90 per cent vaccination threshold before the certificates are ready to go.        But fundamentally, if you think I shouldn't be quibbling over four or six weeks, you're right!        It's astonishing New Zealand doesn't have a fully functional vaccine passport system already developed and tested. Almost every developed country has a system in place. Israel launched its vaccine passport system in February. New York introduced vaccine passports in March. As National's Chris Bishop pointed out yesterday, Cuba has a vaccine passport system. Burkina Faso has a vaccine passport system!        But as recently as the start of August, in an interview with the Herald's Claire Trevett, Jacinda Ardern ruled out using vaccine passports in New Zealand. This was at a time when New South Wales was already recording hundreds of new infections a day.        Naivety or hubris? Why wouldn't New Zealand need vaccine passports when everyone else did? What makes us so special?        At the very least, the delay points to complacency. The development of a domestic vaccine passport system should have been a priority from the moment we placed our order with Pfizer, even if it later proved New Zealand never needed to use it.        That vaccine certificates aren't already functional tells us officials did not sufficiently prepare for a scenario in which New Zealand couldn't eliminate the virus.        We've been caught flat-footed with vaccine certificates because we thought we were different to everyone else. We thought we were better.        We were wrong.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/qdqw85/jack_tame_vaccine_certificates_should_have_been/hho7qx4/

662,6,1634623978,"&gt;&gt; Yes, and we are proposing we reduce deaths by increasing vaccination rates, which can be done by offering incentives to get vaccinated. &gt;  &gt; That's already happening by many groups all around the country. What more do they need, free hand jobs?  We know more is needed because our vaccination rates aren't high enough. I don't know exactly what's needed but luckily the smart people in the government are (finally) looking into that.   &gt;&gt;This comment chain is people explicitly calling to do exactly what the government is planning to do, we just think it was a bad idea to wait until 63 days into lockdown to start thinking about those plans.  &gt;Ah yes so instead if should be they come up with a plan on day 1 when they have no idea how it's spreading, before they get international evidence on what works and what doesn't and before they can evaluate costs, resources etc. of any response required.  You actually don't require active COVID spread to have vaccines incentives. You can push vaccines while knowing nothing about spread, because the effectiveness of vaccines doesn't depend on an outbreak happening. For example, the government could have started developing the vaccine passport app several months ago, instead of waiting until now. Do you agree that it would be possible to develop a vaccine passport app not just on day 1 of the outbreak, but 100 days before the outbreak? None of the government's vaccine plans need to rely on an outbreak! The international evidence is already out there - it didn't all appear a week ago.   &gt;You will find out on Friday, like everyone else.  Yes, but it would be great if we found out several Fridays ago, because then more people would have been vaccinated in the mean time and the outbreak would be smaller.   We both agree its good that the government is pushing vaccines - but for some insane reason you think it's good to wait 66 days before doing so. That's 66 days in which spread is greater than it otherwise would have been.     &gt;&gt;Good to see your commitment to high quality discourse didn't end at spreading antivax propaganda.  &gt;By all means prove this strawman.  /u/Golgavar said: ""When though?

663,7,1634633998,"&gt;But what action do you think would have helped?  Pretty much a lot of what they're doing now, but done with more urgency when we had months of zero Covid.  Our vaccine passport system should be ready by now. Yes they take time to develop, but there is no way that late November is acceptable. Our ability to reduce restrictions safely now also depends on how long this takes to be completed.  Expanding health capacity. While extremely difficult, the govt has done less than the bare minimum. Allowing healthcare workers residencies to expire, not prioritising new health worker visa's or MIQ spots. [This is damning.](https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/126608859/miqueue-health-sector-mystified-over-struggle-to-get-staff-into-nz)  Our ICU ""surge capacity"" is dire. It's a joke - a last minute scramble to attempt to look like they've prepared. Nurses for this surge capacity have been given a total 8 hours training, half of it via an online module. Compared to around 230 hours of orientation training for normal ICU nurses.  Low Māori vaccination rates are an issue people have seen coming since the start.  The govt can't fix deep intergenerational mistrust in a racist institution, but it could do *something.* Maybe trusting Māori healthcare providers with funds just half as much as they trusted businesses with the $13 billion dollar wage subsidy? Rolling out innovative solutions for isolated communities early? Instead we've got a community [having to fund their mobile vax clinic via Givealittle.](https://www.stuff.co.nz/pou-tiaki/300433491/tairwhiti-dhb-boss-embraces-rural-vax-fundraiser)  A lot of this isn't directly the fault of cabinet ministers, rather the result of general public-sector inertia. But there is a clearly established disconnect between policies implemented by ministers and what actually gets put in place by their ministries. The administrations inability to cut through ministry red tape and actually get shit done is an *abject failure.*  The plan isn't and shouldn't have been as simple as locking down until we vaccinate.

Allow restaurants, bars, cafes etc to open, but only to people who are fully vaccinated.  People who aren't vaccinated must continue to follow Level 3 rules (including people who only have the first dose - they likely only have 1-2 more weeks before 2nd dose anyway). If they are found to be breaking it in some way, instant fine.  This rewards the Aucklanders who have done the right thing, plus allows businesses to actually start getting back on track again.

Both of acting too cautiously and without reference to the conditions. And the condition that I fixate on is ""what to do in the face of persistent and stable numbers of unlinked cases"".  In terms of the present outbreak:  * put the whole country back in level four * in exchange, we just straight up bribe the electorate... if possible everyone over the age of 15 gets $500 a week for level four, $350 in level three and $125 in level two; otherwise, just give everyone $500/wk for six weeks  * it's expensive, yes... but just locking down isn't going to be enough, it's not just more lockdown and good weather people are being bribed for  * naturally, lockdown breakers forfeit their payments * say that everywhere other than Auckland &amp; Hamilton will remain in level four for sixteen days, after which lowering the level will be considered on a geographical basis * Auckland &amp; Hamilton will remain in level four for a minimum of four weeks and a minimum of level three for at least the following three weeks after that, in order to conduct **door to door testing**  * households are given $50 per test as an additional incentive (on top of the bribe)  * for the first two weeks, a refusal to take a test would result in the name of the refusal and the address being recorded  * during this first fortnight, people will be offered nasal swabs while essential workers, symptomatic people and those who've been at LOIs will also get salva testing    * (this is to help verify the accuracy of the saliva contract we have... which appears to be in some doubt even though accurate saliva testing is known to exist; [if someone has more up to date info on this matter than the 3rd of September, that'd be great](https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/opinion-analysis/126192384/covid19-the-issues-with-saliva-tests-and-why-nzs-rollout-has-been-so-slow))  * in the third week, the government will authorise a mandate to accept a saliva test being that a saliva test is non-invasive, but testing continues  * the people who refused to be tested initially are priority tested on days 22, 23, 24 and 25... and then again five and fourteen days after the test they do have  * once all the day 39 tests have results back (hopefully, before 1pm day 42), a decision on the level for Auckland and Hamilton is made  * it may be necessary to ask authorities in Chinese cities that have tried this for advice on how to practically do this  In terms of the longer term credibility of the above approach and reducing the need to do it again (for any sort of disease):  * give people $50 for each vaccine shot they've had or are in the middle of getting  * again, it's expensive, but it's time to bite the bullet * return GST to 12.5%, adjust the PAYE bands upwards, add more PAYE bands to increase taxation on higher income; announce a land tax that will be associated with a dramatic cut in GST   * (it won't be revenue neutral... the idea is to shift the burden for paying for the bribes on to the wealthy, whilst also addressing concerns about the prices of consumer goods) * overhaul the alert system so that it has more levels allowing for greater nuance and a built in ""2019 gearing"" Level 0 setting * establish a vaccine &amp; antibiotic &amp; antibiotic alternative (e.g. [bacteriophages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phage_therapy)) research institute in Palmerston North... leverage our reputation garnered from taking appropriate action against Covid to attract notable researchers  * naturally the immediate priority would be anti-delta vaccine work but the idea is to be thinking bigger than just Covid * helping to vaccinate the vaccine excluded world, before pursuing a booster policy from the second half of 2022  * which is to prioritise essential and border workers and *then* at risk groups * passing a law that explicitly allows employers to take ""no jab, no job"" stances and putting a national vaccine mandate to referendum * developing a vaccine passport * a pandemic response agency in Auckland (e.g. as proposed by National) also seems like a good idea  * I want the agency to be in Auckland so that the government, the institute, the dedicated MIQ and the agency are all in different places; but, also, I attribute some of the complications we've had with Covid policy to Auckland's being exposed to wildly different conditions to those experienced by decision makers and their advisers * more money and staffing in the healthcare sector... again, another reason why the tax changes can't be revenue neutral * investment in active modes infrastructure to   * encourage healthier lifestyles (reducing demand on the healthcare sector from new public health challenges and freeing that capacity up for other uses, e.g. old public health challenges like contagious and infectious disease)   * make more free commuting options available (helping make living in NZ more affordable),   * whilst also providing space to socially distance (if need be) while exercising  * and bringing these possibilities to communities that are most starved of these possibilities (where it is also cheaper to do a lot quickly, i.e. outlying suburbs) * improving the ventilation in public buildings, in particular, schools * improved communications strategies... I have heard that the ""contact"" lingo we've been using is unhelpful so perhaps:  * same dwelling cases  * same workplace cases  * customers of workplace cases  * priority link type unclear (for if they can't tell if the link is a dwelling, workplace or customer scenario but are sure it is one of those options)  * other epidemiologically linked cases  * suspected link cases  * no established link cases  * and reporting two week and four week numbers (in particular for the above); though, of course, the press conferences can focus on the linked, unlinked and suspected link numbers, just so long as c  Thoughts on the border situation:  * get really into vaccine aid * require travellers to NZ to be either fully vaccinated or medically exempted to the satisfaction of a NZ based body  * I guess if they make it to NZ and can't satisfy either of these requirements they can be chucked in MIQ at their expense (below, I propose a dedicated MIQ be built) * continue with the present MIQ system for four weeks during which a trial ""in home"" isolation procedure is conducted  * trial results permitting, at the six week stage (15 Nov.) transition to ""in home"" isolation for vaccinated citizens and permanent residents, whilst simultaneously opening up MIQ to fully vaccinated non-NZers from countries with greater than 50% vaccination rates (I would prioritise international students and healthcare workers, personally)  * have **an eye to something more like an open border by 1 January** * expand the contact tracing system &amp; increase research into epidemiology in this country * build a dedicated MIQ in a location where  *  (a) leaks won't lead to whatever contagious disease running rampant in a major city and   * (b) there is a large enough population that if this facility had its own attached ICU/disease geared mini-hospital, valuable use of those facilities outside an outbreak footing would be possible...   * I'm thinking the best fit for these conditions is probably somewhere in Northland would be best (not too far from Auckland Airport, relatively easy to isolate the region in the event of a leak... National's Airport vicinity proposal still has the risk of having people who live in and work in Auckland being employed there)  * I'm sure Northland's businesses will be happy to have the economic activity that comes from the employees of such a site when they're not at work  * in the absence of a pandemic, I'm sure such a site could be used for expanding refugee settlement or even as a hotel * try and create some kind of Asia Pacific Public Health Forum with economies like Queensland, Vietnam, Taiwan and so forth to advocate for pro-elimination policies... larger economies to be invited to join once an institutional bias towards being good neighbours is established  * we can headquarter this in the MIQ facility, say * just straight up giving permanent residences (subject to a security check, I suppose) to people in country during a border closure",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/q0u3o4/29_new_community_cases_28_in_auckland_1_in/hfaqfn1/

I ask this because, if the passport did extend to most things, you may not technically be forcing the vaccine upon people, but you're essentially forcing them nonetheless.

Everybody is being presented with a choice - take the vaccine or not?    Antivaxxers retain their bodily autonomy - they remain unvaccinated! - and will continue to be unvaccinated until they choose vaccination.

Vaccination status is not a protected class like age, gender, sexual orientation, illness or disability. Denying unvaccinated people service or access to premises is no more discrimination than a ban from from bar, trespass, particularly if vaccination status requirements are the law of the land - we enforce age limits for age restricted content even where age is a protected class.     Any 'harm' antivaxxers feel is purely self-inflicted as a result of their inaction or decision and they can easily remedy it themselves.

There are stupid conspiracy theories Iike the microchip stuff but there are also ones worth paying attention to imo.   It's well known people (and especially older people) with multiple comorbidities are the majority of people affected adversely with covid so why is there no focus on obesity, on diet, on supplementation (vit D and C), on getting daily exercise?

Look for a reduction to more normal Level 2 in Mid-November and the border around Auckland being dropped in early December when the rest of the country catches up to Auckland for vaccination levels.

846,4,1632935631,"As a half kiwi living in Calgary, I'll toss on some of Alberta's information for reference/comparison... We are definitely further ""right"" politically than BC, but the urban centers are closer to the center for that perspective.  As a province, Alberta has hit ~70% of total population fully vaxxed (like 80% eligible). Issue is we're not really moving quickly towards 80% of total, so the 1200+ cases we get a day are just normal now. We have, I think, the highest per capita deaths in Canada as well (2663 with a population of 4.4 million or so). Our ICU capacity is pretty maxed out as is, surgeries are delayed, other provinces are on standby to help us out, etc...so the numbers could escalate quickly.  Calgary has hit about 80% eligible, and Edmonton is about the same. We've potentially started to plateau finally (fingers crossed the data holds), but the issue is the rural areas. They haven't even come close to those vaccination rates, and continue to spiral out of control (High Level for example in the North region, which is the lowest rate in the province ~22%). The North region has hit 100% ICU capacity, and some of the other rural ones are in the 90s. Edmonton and Calgary are both mid 80s last I checked, but the situation is clearly bad. 92% of ICU patients are unvaccinated. The government is still loathe to place restrictions back in, so we're to basically get through this as best we can.   The only saving grace is businesses and other organizations have started to push vaccine mandates, so it has helped to potentially drive the vaccination number up, but again it's centered in urban centers.

864,13,1632872598,"tl;dr -- most of the problems I have with the list are explained away in the PDF.  ----  &gt;Supercharge the vaccine rollout;  How?  Key's ideas for doing this were (1) stupid and offensive and (2) weirdly obsessed with vouchers but they were mechanisms not aspirations.  Just mandate all vaccines... it's the best solution and you know it.  **What does a more detailed plan reveal?** Mechanisms, basically. They seem okay... good even (though I doubt they'll work... as they tacitly appear to acknowledge in saying mandates are required for healthcare workers: if their ideas are good enough why aren't they good enough for healthcare workers?).  &gt;Order vaccine boosters;  I'm inclined to agree that boosters are required. However, I also think that vaccinating people globally needs to be prioritised.  **What does a more detailed plan reveal?** Not much, frankly. You would hope that they at least address these concerns but they do not.  &gt;Upgrade our contact tracing capability;  This is also pointlessly aspirational but we've seen that they can do good mechanisms once already...  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** Vastly more than in the previous case. It looks like common sense things that should already have been done in, say, January this year.  &gt;Roll out saliva testing at the border and in the community  The only thing I can say straight up about this is something I'm not sure I actually read so I won't say it.  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** Basically, (1) saliva testing is just as effective, (2) it's far less invasive and, though this is only implicit, therefore (3) mandate daily testing for border workers, MIQ residents (on top of the current nasal tests) and hospital staff.  &gt;Roll out rapid tests for essential workers and in the community;  There are, again (see above), some ambiguities about what this means that might be readily resolved (is this daily, also?).  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** No it's intolerably, and unusually given the others, vague.   They seem to be suggesting a rapid test will just become a routine part of going to a GP or A&amp;E but that's not clear (it may even mean healthcare more generally). I'm pretty sure they're suggesting a rapid test on arrival in country but after that I'm a bit lost at what they want. They mention making rapid testing available to people to buy (how does this mesh with the contact tracing proposal? I don't know) and they suggest doing something for essential workers and customer facing, high volume roles (e.g. education workers, retail). What, however, that latter plan is I cannot say.  &gt;Create a dedicated agency, Te Korowai Kōkiri, to manage our Covid-19 response based in Manukau not Wellington;  I have often wondered if the larger part of the decision making around Covid settings in Auckland has been driven by people completely removed from life here in South Auckland, e.g. because they're in Wellington. However, I hate Wellington so #biased.  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** Basically, they say a Pandemic Response Agency is required... no argument from me... but they do not justify the location even though they're really specific about it. I should be clear that while Papakura's electoral borders are (a) huge and (b) enormously unstable [seriously, look at the maps, it's about as big as the rest of Auckland altogether], Manukau is not in Judith Collins' electorate so it's unlikely to be ""pork barrel"" politics. It's quite inexplicable though I do have a theory.  &gt;Build purpose-built quarantine;  Where? And why not state exactly where? Please don't be in Manukau...  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** Auckland Airport-ish. So... Manukau or Mangere (depending which direction you approach the Airport from, really).   I guess there's not too much difference between being a little isolated from Auckland as a whole and being a lot isolated from it. However, I would also say there isn't too much difference between being right in the middle of the CBD and drawing staff from all over Auckland, and being anywhere else in Auckland and drawing staff from all over Auckland. You have fewer avenues for a disease to escape quarantine but if it does (via staff), it's still loose and running in Auckland.  It's a tricky situation since you need to be somewhere that you can get people to and which already has some kind of proximity to a good location to have knowledge workers live. There is, I argue, a solution that mostly works. Connecting flights to Palmerston North. Not ideal, I admit, and a raw deal for Palmerston North if there is an outbreak... but it's got a university, which means there's a natural use for these units if there's no pandemic.  &gt;Launch a digital app for vaccination authentication;  I guess it's the best approach to a vaccine passport?  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** I guess that's their thinking also. Actually come to think of it... just create a vaccine ID number and use a registry.   &gt;Invest in next-generation Covid treatments  Again, with the needless aspirationism. I get that you can't necessarily embrace everything you want to do in a snappy phrase but why not ""Build and Operate a Contagious Disease Research Institute"", say?  **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** Their problem is more or less to do with how Pharmac works. They could have just said that. It does appear that the standard operating model is too inflexible to deal with ""novel"" problems, but I prefer my idea (which isn't mutually exclusive, of course).  &gt;Prepare our hospitals and expand ICU capacity.  Unpopular opinion but I have generally found the ICU capacity arguments to lack the ""there's not enough capacity"" argument.   **What does the more detailed plan reveal?** I find the same problem here. However, the major purpose seems to be ""steal doctors and nurses from overseas"" but there's also stuff in there about ""let's not be dicks to the ones we've already acquired"" and ""let's make some more homegrown ones for the future"".  At this point, I return to the idea of Palmerston North. You see, there's a university there, as I said, so it just makes sense to me to try and make it a natural hub for all things contagious in country. If that requires another medical school, so be it. I imagine that would also have the effect of requiring building more ICU beds.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/pxg2jo/opening_up_national_announces_10_steps_to_prepare/henqkbc/

868,17,1632882066,"But we’ll never a jump between 80 and 90%. If OP is correct that we’ll plateau at 80%, the effort that will take to halve the remaining number of unvaccinated will become increasingly difficult and therefore increasingly the wrong thing to do.   It seems that in every country around the world so far increasingly strict vaccine mandates result in increasing unrest. Whether or not you disagree with the unrest doesn’t change the fact that it is damaging to society. Be it protests, riots, or truckers blocking highways, society will be disrupted and it will cause harm. Never mind the fact that logic tells us those protesting against vaccine mandates are not going to work or have resigned/been fired from work because they are unvaccinated.   The amount of money, effort, and time that I believe other countries have spent to not only create and decided upon mandates, but to implement and enforce them, is probably so extraordinary as to be more than what it would have cost to seriously increase icu capacity and support the healthcare system in other ways. Let alone those healthcare workers themselves who volunteered to continue to work all through last year without a vaccine and back when we really had no idea how dangerous this virus was. Yet they still trooped on. If the vaccine rate of healthcare works to the normal population is roughly the same then that is not an insignificant number of works who would be fired or resign.   So the incredibly steep and expensive uphill battle to try and raise the vaccine rate clearly comes with a huge amount of issues, but another thing worth considering is that it also represents diminishing returns. A vaccine passport for overseas travel seems obvious, and should be implemented, but anything more than that domestically will prove itself an expensive waste of time.  In any case it doesn’t appear as though the government has put any effort into bolstering the health care system since our first outbreak, so it doesn’t seem as though they would do it now. And if we open up the borders then obviously (like the rest of the world) covid will be 100* endemic. Because that’s only a matter of time, covid is already practically endemic.

Thankfully we are at a stage where it seems to be plateauing and hospitals aren’t yet overrun. Almost every death is an unvaccinated person, go figure 🤔  Lots of employers and other entities are requiring vaccines like universities, airlines and so on. Even many jobs at requiring it. We have also been using a passport system for non-essential places like restaurants and gyms for two weeks, and prior to its implementation there was a new surge in vaccine appointments.   I think what you guys have against you is that Covid hasn’t hit you hard. You haven’t seen a lot of deaths, dealt with restrictions and have been living mostly normally through this time. Personally I think this may make NZ more hesitant at first, but of course people will just need to accept the inevitable and get vaxxed.   In a weird way even though we haven’t handled things as well over here I think dealing with all the shit of the past year really made people see the value in the vaccine.

The case of some English guy in the 1950s springs to mind who was prosecuted for not showing his ID when requested by a policeman. He refused the request because the law was introduced during the war as a security measure to catch spies and since the war was long over, he questioned the relevance of the law since the war had ended some time ago.

We are also accepting that the rights of our citizens to return to NZ, as guaranteed on their passports, has been curtailed on the order of a government department functionary.  Also using the state of emergency to rush unrelated laws through parliament without the proper processes. More limitations of free speech to come. Anti terrorism legislation to come, sounds rushed through parliament, not much support from other parties. They've taken everyone's automatic and semi-automatic firearms from them which would have been required to mount any reasonable uprising/revolution against an authoritarian government.  Covid is going to be around for a while now, with new variants creating problems. It definitely seems like the government and Ministry of Health have given up on proper elimination i.e. 0 cases in the community. They're not interested in investing in proper quarantine facilities, they like to use leaky hotels so outbreaks keep happening, in our largest city even. They seem almost entirely clueless about efficacy of certain masks i.e. bandana 0%, cloth 0-30%, surgical 11%, double masking 60-90%, N95 respirator 95%, N99 respirator 99% etc. If they really wanted to eliminate community transmission they would mandate double masking or N95+ in public places to stop onward spread and stop more people being infected.  So since elimination is now impossible (because they let it in repeatedly and we're doing a half-arsed job of controlling it) I'm thinking they'll say we'll now be required to live with the emergency settings indefinitely, i.e. no level 1, permanent level 2+/3/4, scanning in everywhere you go, paying electronically (fully trackable), having Bluetooth tracing on so they know who you're in contact with, refusal to pass a law that will stop the tracing data being used by Police, SIS, GCSB etc, papers and negative testing to cross the border or leave Auckland.  Now they're talking about vaccine passports for local community use (not even international travel). I have a vaccination booklet with Yellow Fever in it which was required for a long time for international travel in some countries. Never have I heard before about a vaccine required to dine in a restaurant or visit the cinema etc. I am fully vaccinated but I know for a fact that the vaccine doesn't provide sterilising immunity. One vaccinated person with a breakthrough infection can go to the cinema, restaurant etc and spread it around via the air conditioning and give delta to many people there seeing that the vaccine is only 40% effective against getting infected. The viral load is the same so they'll then pass it on and so on. Having them vaccinated dampens the spread a little, but not a lot. The local vaccine passport requirements is almost useless in that regard. Better to have a rapid spit test before entry. This is another thing the government has no interest in doing, because they prefer the police state policies of scanning in and showing papers.  At the end of the day, once the freedoms are gone it will be almost impossible to get them back.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/pug772/is_anyone_else_getting_really_sick_of_the/he4wej6/

882,2,1632528304,"Is it even based in science?  - Current vaccines only provide ""good"" protection against hospitalisation and death (not perfect). We actually need more tailored vaccines against delta and newer variants. The vaccines were developed for the original wild virus.  - A double vaccinated person has a ~61% chance of a breakthrough infection (vaccine is 39% effective against delta).  - A vaccinated person with breakthrough Covid can still spread the virus just like an unvaccinated and they have similar viral load. The vaccines don't prevent transmission here.  - Herd immunity with level 1 measures alone and relying on vaccines is looking almost impossible.  Basic numbers, even with some kind of vaccine passport for cinemas/indoor restaurants/nightclubs and 100 people in the cinema/restaurant/nightclub:  - Nobody is masked because the government tells them it's ""safe"" because everyone is vaccinated.  - A vaccinated person with a breakthrough infection enters and is breathing out virus into the same shared air environment over a period of 1-3 hours.  - You could expect 61 vaccinated people will get an infection, a bunch might be asymptomatic but some will have symptoms, 5 might get severe illness and need hospitalisation, then maybe a few die depending on healthcare availablity.

For anything other than vaccines, this kind of restriction would be too totalitarian, but vaccines are there to protect society as much as the individual.   Given the number of people who can't get vaccinated, antivaxers make it hard to achieve effective heard immunity for covid. But from my experience (I've run into a few and had conversations, and have 2nd hand accounts of some), most antivaxers are sceptics, not crazies, and the social pressure from vaccine (or tests) to enter bars seems to swing most of them towards getting jabbed. Having something so obvious that has real effects on their life and widespread acceptance seems to enough to quash their doubt.  And even with a lot of bars not checking it at the door, when you go to events here the organisers will often check separately (eg: meetups), and just having people offering to show them when there's no checks seems to be enough.  For the record, we can sit outside at bars/cafes/whatever with no restrictions (still with contact tracing), but if we want to go inside we have to be vaccinated.

My idea for medium risk arrivals is this:   They need a vaccine passport and negative rapid tests before the flight and on arrival, then special quarantine taxis/ubers with the driver totally separated from passengers, to deliver them to self-isolation at home if they can be alone, or at quarantine airbnbs if they have family/flatmates at home. Then a PCR test on day 3-5.  Once clear they can leave quarantine, but agree to avoid any social gatherings over say 10 people, so no church or pub, and always wear a mask outside the house until they have another negative test on day 12 and clear day 14.

Still, that is not relevant to what rights we have under existing laws to have a covid passport. 2. It doesn't need to. Again, have you been vaccinated or not.

You need to get whatever country they are coming from to link their version on the NHI number in a way that respects privacy with a NZ passport. And you have to do that per country.  That is a huge undertaking. not to mention every country has laws around the sharing, storage and use of personal medical information. What you're describing is a 6-8 month piece of work per country and will cost hundreds not millions of not billions. And I'm not even getting into all the work needed to get other countries on board with the idea in the first place.  &gt; It is a false assumption to say that it would take years to develop when the system is already there. All it would take is the political will to link the two systems so that they share the data.  It really isn't, if anything I'm under estimating the amount of work involved.   A far better solution is one that isn't linked to a person's health information at all, and only contains the vaccine information or lack there of. And even that is not easy to implement because you need to get a near global consensus on how it will work before you implement anything.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/phg8hx/government_not_recording_vaccination_status_of/hbjosqj/

1001,1,1630586982,"&gt;What purpose do you see for a vaccine passport to enter a supermarket when a vaccinated person is perfectly capable of spreading the virus as well?  They are capable, but much, much less likely to spread it.  A fully vaccinated person is still 50-75% less likely to be infected.  Then even when infected their infectious period is much shorter and their milder symptoms make them less likely to infect others.  So their risk in far from zero, but still greatly, greatly reduced.    We can't take risks with vaccinated people now while we have a zero covid approach, because one case is too many.  But in a future mitigation or suppression environment vaccinated people can be treated as much less risky.    Secondly the purpose is specifically to make life inconvenient for the unvaccinated, to encourage them to get vaccinated.   &gt;You think preventing kids from 'antivax' homes from getting a normal education is a net win for society?  I think the number of truly antivax nuts who will actually go to the trouble of home schooling their children to avoid it is very, very small.  The number of vaccine hesitant or mildly antivax who will give in and get their kids vaxxed if that is the price of sending them to school is much higher.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/pggqca/new_caledonia_ponders_compulsory_covid19/hbb5tv6/

Mike's Minute: Could this lockdown have been avoided?   ON AIR   MIKE HOSKING BREAKFAST   AuthorMike Hosking, Publish DateWed, 18 Aug 2021, 9:54AM   So, let's be honest, as we said last week, this was always a race.    Did we get jabbed before the next case arrived or did Covid win? Well, Covid won.     We are not only where we don’t want to be, most importantly, we are where we don't need to be. Australia, and we have watched them increasingly nervously were, in the same boat.     Not enough vaccine and too much smugness.    The critical error was Scott Morrison saying it's not a race, when it was. Our lot made the same mistake based on the same level of arrogance and complacency. We don’t have Covid, so we can take all year to roll out a vaccine programme.    No, we can't.    Once Australia fell apart you knew the Government here was starting to panic. They had seen the Morrison sheen fall away, the blame game had started, the polls were sinking, and with it has come a massive economic bombshell as yet again billions get wiped off the bottom line.    We are where we are this morning because we have no other choice. But the critical part is we have no other choice because we dropped the ball, we failed to act in a way we needed to. Leadership was lacking. Urgency was lacking.    The answer was the answer so much of the world has got on with. Vaccines.    Vaccines are the passport to freedom. No, they are not a magic bullet, but they are the best we have. They are effective, they avoid the sort of lockdown and economic damage this country has favoured too many times now. They are better than where we are this morning.    And we could have been where others are.    Vaccination rates at a high and successful level allow cases in the community because vaccines mean you don’t die or end up on a ventilator. Vaccines aren't quite complete freedom, but they are more freedom than we have.    They provide more choice than we have. We shouldn’t be where we are.    But yet here we are again, 18 months on, same clumsy result. All of this in an era where we have better options.    Why don't we have better options? Because yet again the Government has failed to move, failed to fix, and failed to deliver.

Israel has just reported that after 6 months even the Pfizer vaccine is only 39% effective at preventing symptomatic infection with Delta and the US CDC has reported those fully vaccinated with Delta carry the same viral load and are just as contagious as unvaccinated and now mask mandates are being restored for the vaccinated too.    A July 4th celebration in Provincetown has now resulted in nearly 900 cases of Covid, of which 74% were fully vaccinated.  And Pfizer and Israel have said a 3rd booster will be needed at 6 months.    That means a vaccine passport will likely soon be irrelevant.  Vaccinated people will be just as risky as the unvaccinated for spreading the virus here.  It will still give them better protection against severe illness an death, but it won't protect the community.

We are miles behind and that isn't going to change fast enough to get the border open earlier.    &gt;Furthermore, as it'd be the anti-vaxxers who would be primarily responsible for Covid spreading, it seems fundamentally unfair to require everyone to distance and mask to protect the healthcare system.   It is fundamentally unfair and would be infuriating.  But it would also be necessary.  Vaccinated people would die too, of other causes like car accidents and cancer, when they couldn't get hospital care.   &gt;I would much prefer a vaccine passport system.  I'd prefer that too, but it would be unworkable in NZ.  We can't even enforce the masks on public transport rule now.  So who would enforce a vaccine passport system? The govt refuses to put that kind of burden onto bus drivers for masking rules now.

Although I agree in the sense that it probably won't happen, but I don't think it's ""unworkable"" as so much as the government likely can't be bothered trying, and instead would prefer to keep a hard border up much longer than necessary, partially because it's the easy option and partially because they probably won't suffer politically for it.",newzealand,t5_2qhma,/r/newzealand/comments/olpfgg/no_return_to_normal_expected_in_postpandemic_new/h5h6cjq/

I guess I'd agree with you in that there definitely isn't certainty one way or the other - this relates to my original comment that media commentators flippantly inferring everything will be 'one way' (ie ""back to normal"") as being poor form when there is a large amount of uncertainty and evidence that it might not be.    Also to clarify, what I've seen/heard is not that borders will be necessarily ""closed"" in 2023 (I mean they aren't even closed now) but that neither will they be ""open"".  Its far more nuanced than that eg a robust/recognized global vaccine passport is likely a couple of years away,  there are a lot of countries that wont have vaccinated their populations,  a lot of airlines/tourism operators/routes etc are simply gone, things that were 'feasible' before wont be anymore in the post-covid world due to numbers, all kinds of insurances including personal (travel/health) and corporate (event, health &amp; safety etc) have changed which is huge, health and safety considerations themselves have changed, appetites for and perceptions around risk have changed.

Currently you have countries duking it out in a bidding war over half a dozen different vaccines with a bunch more companies doing the actual manufacturing. Adding in extra variables like production supply chain, storage conditions, and multiple doses makes traceability very difficult. If you have a digital vaccine passport, that would need to be hosted on a central server by a central entity containing vaccine records for billions of people globally (and would need constant updating for boosters in the years to come). So who does that - the WHO, the IATA? Do they create different versions that are accepted in some parts of the world but not others? The cost to run such a system would be immense. The most feasible way to do it is using blockchain tech, but that's not at the mass adoption level yet where it would be quick or easy to develop.

1050,0,1619976447,"Continued: Back to Fauci, his wife is on the board of directors of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, who is being sued by the African nation Kenya, because the tetanus vaccines distributed there in 2014 through GAVI (gates created and controlled) rendered all of the women infertile because of the presence of HCG antigen.  Now it has come to light that 97% of people admitted to the ICU with COVID are simply vitamin D deficient. Gates proposed to block out the sun with atmospheric aerosols to combat global warming. Gates father was a renowned Eugenicist, a signatory to the Eugenic society. Klaus Schwab, Gates, the Rockefellers, Kissinger and other .01% economic ""elite"" meet every year in Davos, Switzerland at the World Economic Forum. You know what the problem is? Human overpopulation. What better way to get in front of both the global economic collapse that was to occur in 2020 due to fiscal stimulus / money printing and a collapsing dollar and the human population bottleneck than with a fake pandemic.  Exactly zero of the information here is infactual. You have been thoroughly, completely bamboozled.  The crux of the matter is that this entire ""pandemic"" is based on the PCR test at 50 amplification cycles, and scientists, epidemiologists the world over were calling this out very early on. Anything above 25-30 cycles results in a huge false positive rate (97% @ 50 cycles!). The day of Biden's inauguration (I voted for Jill Stein last time around, Corporate Left = Corporate Right, I don't like Trump nor Biden, but they managed to politicize it so that if you call out the Fake Pandemic youre a ""Trump supporter"") the WHO announced that 50 cycles was too high and, and I'm not kidding here, ""all of the tests from 2020 need to be ""redone"". Yes that's correct. The justification for the lockdowns, the ""pandemic"" was all based on PCR test at 50 amplification cycles and now the day of Biden's inauguration the WHO comes out and announces that the tests need to be redone. Can you fucking undo the lockdowns? Does anyone know that more people committed suicide in Japan in the month of November 2020 than died from COVID 19 for the entire year, direct consequence of the lockdowns? Do you understand that childhood suicide is on the rise? Youre going to tell kids to stay at home and their only form of interaction with other children and the world at large is through a fucking ipad? We are DESTROYING these children for something with a 99.97% rate of survival! In fact under 50 the IFR for seasonal flu is higher than SARS-CoV-2! 6 feet? Why not 7 or 8? It's an arbitrary figure that has no backing from ANY science! You can enter a restaurant ""you must wear your mask to enter"" and then when you sit down you take the fucking mask off and no-one questions the logic or rationale for the masks? Bacterial pneumonia is on the rise because not only do these fabric masks not keep out 7nm virus but paper is a medium for bacterial growth. Sweden never did the lockdown, the social distancing nor the mask mandate, want to guess how many people died in Oct 2020 from COVID out of a population of 10 million? 55. Texas lifts the lockdown and cases plummet (sunlight, vitamin D and exercise best medicine against influenza virus family). ""Stay at home out of sunlight with your mask on"" they are driving sickness with these policies, on top of the emotional distress and negative social interaction. ""Deaths are up year over year"". Mortality from all causes goes up big time during economic recession.   There is ZERO science supporting the masks, social distancing, nor the lockdowns and these aren't vaccines. They have an agenda. Again, global economy was going to collapse and we do have a human overpopulation problem (not simply overpopulation, more so overconsumption, with China and India poised to attain the level of consumption of a 1st worlder, the planet cannot support this, at present, with only the Anglosphere consuming the energy equivalent of 23 Bangladeshi's, not to mention water (1 pint of Almond Milk = 1600 gallons of embodied water) we need 5 planet Earth's of resources to sustain this level of consumption. The 1 billion that they will keep around after the ""Great Pandemic"" via mRNA vaccines will only be because biological robots are a higher level of robot that can go into the Tesla Truck factory and change a fuse now and then. The 1 billion remaining will be chipped and heavily monitored via 5G + implant interface. If they need to reduce a certain demographic, say there are too many Hispanic people, they will custom taylor the ""top up"" annual vaccines (Pfizer has already announced that a 3rd shot is necessary and that you will need a new one every year, ""kaching kaching"" cash register sound) to delete a number of ""excess"" certain ethnicity or sex or age or whatever.   Here's how they will depopulate, what we see with these mRNA vaccines is a phenomenon called ADE (Antibody Dependent Enhancement) / Pathogenic Priming. A study done on ferrets and then reproduced on non-human primates showed 100% rate of mortality when specimens were given these biologics / gene therapy (they aren't vaccines, they are calling them that so they can remain indemnified under 1986 Childhood Vaccine Injury Act) they all died when exposed to the actual wild variant of the virus later on. Given the difference in body mass and metabolism, as Dr. Schmidt points out, this may take more than one flu season, or maybe not.  Here's my prediction, vulnerable people who blindly rolled up their sleeves for these ""vaccines"" will be dying this or the next upcoming flu season en masse, they will call it ""The Dark Winter"" and Big Pharma owned media and politicians (Cuomo, Newsom) will spin it and claim that the reason why we are having a Dark Winter is because we didn't attain ""herd immunity"" because of vaccine hesitancy. At that point in time they will introduce legislation mandating compulsory vaccination for all adults because of the ""emergency"". They will not come to your doorstep. They will ensure compliance by way of a vaccine passport, at first app based, but then they will introduce implantable RFID chips (more advanced, can communicate with body endocrinology, via 5G, which no-one wants, nor needs (5G is 2.4 GHz millimeter wave EMF, the same freq as U.S. Army active denial system, same tech the Russians were working on in the 1980's, ""psychotronic"" weaponry. 5G @ 100m distance is EMF equivalent of holding a phone directly to your head but about your entire body, 24/7, and they want to put a 5G antenna on every street corner, literally. FCC has been captured by the telecoms just as the FDA and CDC have been captured by Big Pharma and you cannot refuse the installation of this technology, nor are any health and safety studies required).  Anyhow, youre being lied to, we have a problem here on planet earth of too many stupid people, as evidenced by the morons upvoting nonsense ""it's FDA approved!"" here in this thread, and the elites, who can and will replace you with automation systems, intend to bring your numbers down to under 1 billion by 2030 by way of ADE / Pathogenic Priming via 100% vaccination.  They are calling it The Great Reset / Agenda 2030.  Nothing, I repeat, NOTHING stated here is infactual, but you won't ever ascertain that for yourselves because youre so fucking brainwashed.
