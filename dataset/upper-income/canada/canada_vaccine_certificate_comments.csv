However, from the [same site](https://covid-19.ontario.ca/data), 84% of the population is vaccinated and 11% are not. Why are 44% of those in the ICU unvaccinated, while making up 11% of the population?  I would advocate for limiting hospital saturation to a proportion of the population, but using vaccine status as a factor in this decision is currently unethical, it's a [hot subject](https://globalnews.ca/news/8286334/covid-19-can-doctors-deny-medical-care-to-unvaccinateded-patients/) in the medical field because of how blown out of proportion the cost of dealing with such a small number of unvaccinated are.   &gt; If you look at the number of available ICU beds, it's basically been flat for the past 90 days, with only a slight uptick from Omicron.  Are we looking at [the same data](https://i.imgur.com/jLEouhu.png)? I see a quadrupling in number of adults in the ICU between 90 days ago and today, peaking at almost quintupling a week ago.

4,0,1643113643,"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1  &gt; **Methods:**  &gt; We conducted a retrospective observational study comparing three groups: (1)SARS-CoV-2-naïve individuals who received a two-dose regimen of the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine, (2)previously infected individuals who have not been vaccinated, and (3)previously infected and single dose vaccinated individuals. Three multivariate logistic regression models were applied. In all models we evaluated four outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic disease, COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. The follow-up period of June 1 to August 14, 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant in Israel.  &gt; **Results:**  &gt; SARS-CoV-2-naïve vaccinees had a 13.06-fold (95% CI, 8.08 to 21.11) increased risk for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant compared to those previously infected, when the first event (infection or vaccination) occurred during January and February of 2021. The increased risk was significant (P&lt;0.001) for symptomatic disease as well. When allowing the infection to occur at any time before vaccination (from March 2020 to February 2021), evidence of waning natural immunity was demonstrated, though SARS-CoV-2 naïve vaccinees had a 5.96-fold (95% CI, 4.85 to 7.33) increased risk for breakthrough infection and a 7.13-fold (95% CI, 5.51 to 9.21) increased risk for symptomatic disease. SARS-CoV-2-naïve vaccinees were also at a greater risk for COVID-19-related-hospitalizations compared to those that were previously infected.  &gt; **Conclusions:**  &gt; This study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity. Individuals who were both previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and given a single dose of the vaccine gained additional protection against the Delta variant.

5,0,1642883565,"As a Chinese-Canadian (I hold a Canadian passport and have been banned from entering China indefinitely due to COVID-19), I have heard of news pieces where Chinese government officials threaten and coerce immigrants to return. This is generally not a good strategy though. If I am in Canada and I know I am a wanted person in China to the point that the Chinese police are harassing me by phone or in person, I would never return. It is better for me to get murdered by Chinese police in Canada, let the local police and RCMP investigate the murder, than for me to return to China and be disappeared forever, even though the murderer will never be brought to justice.  I have been joking with my mother about the opposite problem that she may face: being banned from entering China due to COVID-19. Full disclosure: my mother has 3 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and has a QR code to prove it.  You see, my mother entered Canada on a ""parent and grandparent super visa"" (introduced way back in 2012 to allow parents and grandparents of Canadian citizens and permanent residents to visit Canada long term). At the time, she was approved for a 2 year stay (she needed to buy her own health insurance but that is it). At the time, she already had an immigration application pending.  Shortly after she landed under the super visa scheme, her immigration application was approved and she ""soft crossed"" the US-Canada border with just her Chinese passport with a newly issued immigration visa on foot (by soft crossing, I mean you leave the Canadian side but never try to enter the US and since she did not have a US visa, she would not have been allowed to go to the US anyway). Once she did that, she became a permanent resident and has had this status ever since. Her passport expired in 2021 though, and something weird is happening. Let me explain.  Back in July of 2021, right around the time that her passport expired, the National Immigration Administration of China issued an order to severely limit who is allowed to apply for Chinese passports. Only those with an Offer of Admission to a foreign school or a job offer from a foreign employer is allowed. Since this order, very ridiculous stories have surfaced:  1. Middle-aged woman in China tries to apply for a passport to go to America because her daughter gave birth to a baby there and she wants to visit. The Chinese authorities refused her passport application citing COVID-19 restrictions. 2. Chinese man who frequently flew between Shanghai and Los Angeles pre-pandemic because his wife and son both live in America got stopped by Chinese Customs officials despite having a valid passport and US Visa. They make him show his wife's ID and even his child's birth certificate, and was questioned extensively on why he needed to go. Once he landed at LAX, he (a foreign national by definition) was not scrutinized by American officials at all, in sharp contrast to when he was exiting China (a country where he is a citizen). 3. Chinese person immigrated to Singapore and has permanent residence status there. Due to the pandemic, the person's passport cannot be renewed at the embassy and as a result, they risked losing permanent residence status and face deportation to China (granted, that in Canada, if you are a permanent resident, it is not mandatory for you to have a passport from your country of origin, nor is it mandatory to possess a permanent resident card, as long as you remain in Canada, so this story applies to only certain countries). The person in question owns a condo in Singapore and may be forced to sell it if permanent residence status is lost.  So, going back to my mother, her passport expired 6 months ago. Since she is not a Canadian citizen, she is not able to get a Canadian passport. But when I went onto the app (Chinese Consulate) that is used to apply for Chinese passports, I realized the required documents are ridiculous. Not only do you need your expired passport and photos for the new passport, you also need to go through facial recognition, submit a document (like a health card, driver's license or bank statement) to prove which province in Canada you live in). In addition, there is a requirement for a photo of the applicant holding up a copy of a recent mainstream newspaper (by recent, they mean within 3 days of taking the photo). They also have this warning: due to COVID-19, in person applications for passports are not accepted, and as a result, your passport will not contain your fingerprint and therefore, you will not be able to use the self serve kiosk when entering China.  Given how hard it is to get a passport these days, I have doubts on whether my mother will even be allowed to get a passport. If she cannot get one, she becomes *de facto* stateless and will have no choice but to apply for Canadian citizenship.  I know this story seems to be irrelevant to this discussion, but it serves to show that in China, citizens can be treated in extreme ways (some are coerced to return or outright kidnapped from other places and transported to China, while others are refused passports or permits). Hong Kong politician Leung Kwok-Hung (the man with really long hair) was one of the most famous Chinese citizens who are banned from entering China due to his anti-CCP views.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/sa8av1/chinas_efforts_to_force_return_of_citizens_whove/htscry8/
6,0,1642788109,"\&gt; There’s the selfish reasoning again  You want to strip people of their right to bodily autonomy or shame them into compliance to get a vaccine that they DO NOT NEED. There is a great deal of irony in your statement. If they are not at risk of hospitalization, then they are not someone who will overrun our hospitals. So the need for personal protection isn't there. If the vaccines do not reduce transmission as they currently aren't, there is no argument for forcing people to get it for communal protection either.  Nada, zip, no reason. I can not in good conscience force a 20 year old athlete to get the jab.  \&gt; It’s not mild at all   Well the WHO disagrees with you as well.  https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/who-sees-more-evidence-that-omicron-affects-upper-respiratory-tract-2022-01-04/  For the overwhelming majority, it is.      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UHvwWWcjYw  Here's a great video I encourage everyone to watch that came out yesterday. It covers a Freedom of Information Act request published in the UK by the Office for National Statistics. It lists the total number of fatalities from COVID with no other underlying causes.  ""Deaths with COVID-19 on the death certificate"" - 174,233    ""Deals from COVID-19 with no other underlying causes"" - 17,371     The average age of death of those of the 17,000 is 81.5. We can already do basic math based on case numbers and fatalities based on age group, but this just solidifies the notion that COVID is only dangerous for the exceptionally ill or the very old. For everyone else, it's not a risk. Yes, protect them, get them vaccinated and safe, but the shots don't reduce transmission in their current iteration and we need to stop locking down 99% of the populace over this.  \&gt; We can’t live the rest of our lives with hospitals filled to the top     Well good thing we're not right now, either.  [https://covid-19.ontario.ca/data/hospitalizations](https://covid-19.ontario.ca/data/hospitalizations)  We have 500 beds currently free with nobody occupying them. We have 2300 beds and non-COVID related cases are occupying 1300 of them. Plus, this chart doesn't even distinguish between hospitalizations FROM COVID vs WITH COVID, so the real number of COVID-exclusive ICU cases is even lower.  My point is, you need to take a step back. The numbers are looking better and better every day and you have an opportunity breathe a sigh of relief.  Those countries are opening up, even the U.S. is to a degree, and many other countries like Sweden moved on a long time ago because of this.

Here are some summary points from a very fresh review of peer reviewed articles:  - Encouragingly, authors of a study conducted among recovered individuals who had experienced mild SARS-CoV-2 infection reported that mild infection induced a robust antigen-specific, long-lived humoral immune memory in humans. - It is known that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces specific and durable T-cell immunity, which has multiple SARS-CoV-2 spike protein targets (or epitopes) as well as other SARS-CoV-2 protein targets. The broad diversity of T-cell viral recognition serves to enhance protection to SARS-CoV-2 variants,15 with recognition of at least the alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), and gamma (P.1) variants of SARS-CoV-2. - Some people who have recovered from COVID-19 might not benefit from COVID-19 vaccination.6 ,  19 In fact, one study found that previous COVID-19 was associated with increased adverse events following vaccination with the Comirnaty BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine (Pfizer–BioNTech) - Although longer follow-up studies are needed, clinicians should remain optimistic regarding the protective effect of recovery from previous infection.

For you it's just a few extra seconds, but for a business it's something they have to do for every customer, including those that will take a lot more than a few seconds.  Your mistake is assuming every customer is calm, reasonable, moderately intelligent, and decently understanding.

62,3,1631824609,"If you’re still reeling from recent anti-vaxxer protests outside downtown hospitals maybe this will lift your spirits: On Monday, the day that dozens of anti-vaxxers spewed their bile on hospital row, roughly 4,500 Torontonians were vaccinated at clinics all over the city. And of those Torontonians, it’s likely that 40-50 per cent received their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, according to Joe Cressy, chair of Toronto’s Board of Health.  Dozens of jerks vs. 4,500 vaccinated Torontonians.  Anti-vaxxers may appear in outraged headline after outraged headline, and don’t get me wrong, they deserve the derision. But we shouldn’t let their reckless racket distract us from the quiet vaccination victories being won consistently at mobile clinics across Toronto, outside transit stations, apartment complexes and shopping centres.  “The city push is going really well,” says Phil Anthony, the manager of vaccination strategy at Michael Garron Hospital in Toronto’s east end. “We’re seeing an increase in first doses on a daily basis and it is driven by hyperlocal clinics.”  This week, the city will push further. Ever fond of embarrassing catch phrases, Mayor John Tory on Wednesday announced the launch of “#DaysofVaxtion,” a four-day pop-up clinic campaign (Thursday-Sunday) aimed at getting shots into the arms of the roughly 314,000 eligible Torontonians who aren’t fully vaccinated (of which, according to Tory, 158,000 have not received a first dose).  Toronto Public Health and hospital staff will set up shop outside various high-density locations, such as TTC stations, schools, parks and malls: a “mega-event” composed of “micro-clinics” according to Tory. “Gone are the days of the world record-breaking clinic at Scotiabank arena,” says Cressy. “Now we’re moving to dozens of hyperlocal clinics.”  Clinics — if you can believe it — where people actually change their minds. It may be utterly pointless trying to convince an anti-vaxxer steeped in conspiracy theory to get immunized. But the success of Toronto’s mobile clinics proves that non-ideologues (a.k.a. people of good faith) can see reason where they once saw fear. Or convenience where they once saw a hassle.  “Last week I was at a clinic in East York outside a series of apartment buildings,” says Cressy. “The first three people in line were all getting their first dose. The first person was a guy about 50 years old and he wanted a vaccine for a couple of months but just didn’t know where to get one. We brought the clinic to him.  “The second person was a woman who was 32 weeks pregnant. She had questions about taking the vaccine while pregnant. She spoke to her OB to a point where she felt comfortable. She came out of her apartment and got the shot while her parents took care of her older kid.”  And the third person in line, Cressy says, was a guy in his thirties who wasn’t staunchly opposed to the vaccine, but who had no plans to be vaccinated until news of the province’s proof of immunization certificate was announced. He “wanted to go to bars,” Cressy says.  The city councillor described the encounters as “a fascinating case study. Three different people all getting their first dose, all with three very different reasons.”  Good for them. Good for us.  If you’re fully vaccinated and you’re frustrated with those who aren’t, it’s easy to forget that the world isn’t divided cleanly into two camps: the fully vaxxed and the never-gonna-get-vaxxed. There are still thousands of people in this city who are on the fence about the shot, leaning toward yes. And helping to nudge them over that fence into the land of protection-from-COVID-19 are health-care workers patiently answering questions and refusing to judge. Their work is invaluable and unending.  “The real story is how well we’ve come together to do this,” adds Michael Garron’s Anthony. “How rewarding it to see so many different sectors come together to vaccinate Toronto: hospitals, Toronto Public Health, community health centres.”  Despite what the anti-vaxxers want you to believe, and what the breathless coverage of their lost cause may suggest, it’s not all doom and gloom in the city.

I've been using it to enter bars and restaurants for several weeks now, however it isn't required here at most other places.  It's important to make a distinction between old-fashioned vaccine cards and a machine-readable document like what we're looking at here.  In the past someone looking to participate in some public activities would just show their card, the person looking at would nod, and we'd be on our way.  The system we have now uses an app to (at a minimum) verify the digital signature of the QR code, ensuring it isn't a fake.  So far, so good - nothing too nefarious here.  However, will these systems be storing your identity and location for contact tracing?  If so, how long will the data be stored?  Who will have access to this data?  This is important, since overlaps in proximity and time between people can be used to determine relationships between people, in the same way that phone and email metadata have been used in the past - imagine an auto-generated list of Facebook friends.  Presuming this data is stored, there's always the risk of a data breach, but beyond that, which government agencies will have access to it?  Would law enforcement be able to access it to aid in investigations?  How about immigration enforcement?  The weakest link in the whole system may be the phones that are used out in the wild to scan these things.  Let's assume the most secure scenario - that no contact tracing is done (unlikely), the identity of scanned codes are not sent over the internet, all the app does is verify the digital signature.  From what I've seen here, the devices used to scan this info aren't dedicated devices, they're the personal phones of whichever employee is working the door.  If their phone is compromised, your personal information could also be compromised.  *Edit -* I should also mention that in practice, a lot of establishments here don't bother to scan my certificate, they just glance at it.

78,0,1630689763,"One problem is that you're basically looking for a hail Mary in the form of a vaccine that offers *sterilizing* immunity.

Breakthrough infections will always be a thing when all we have are vaccines that offer *protective* immunity. You could be in for a long wait before that kind of COVID vaccine would be available (if ever).  Another problem is that Canada is an outlier by still insisting on pre-departure  testing of all *fully* vaccinated people planning to enter Canada in defiance of Hajdu's own advisory panel [which did not recommend such testing of fully-vaccinated travellers before trying to cross a Canadian border checkpoint](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/medical-devices/testing-screening-advisory-panel/reports-summaries/priority-strategies-quarantine-borders.html#a6).

It's either you get tested or your get fully vaccinated. Satisfying just one of these conditions precludes you from needing to shell out for a negative PCR test before boarding your flight and/or automatic quarantine upon arrival. There are some countries like Czech Republic and Portugal which allow incoming Canadians only if they show a negative PCR test result. This is because Canada still lacks a *federally*\-backed vaccine certificate like the EU, Israel and Serbia, and so prospective Canadian incomers must provide a negative test result. The .pdfs issued by the home province/territory mean jack shit to Czech and Portuguese border guards.  In practice, this means that I'm currently free to go to Germany or Poland without a pre-takeoff test since they recognize fully vaccinated Canadians like me as ""safe"", not needing automatic quarantine or post-arrival testing.

This is why Canadians (and Americans) make do with such a mickey-mouse hodgepodge of ""proof"" for COVID-19 vaccination that's backed only by a province or territory (or state for some Americans) compared to Europeans and Israelis. The latter's certificates are nationally or supra-nationally backed. The idea that Germans, for example, get a vaccine ""certificate"" backed by their home *Bundesland* (e.g. Bavaria, Hesse, Thuringia) instead of the German government or EU does not compute. This is also related to why the Czech Republic does **not** consider any Canadian to be fully vaccinated [because it recognizes only nationally-backed vaccination certificates rather than sub-national ones](https://www.mzv.cz/ottawa/en/news_and_events/the_conditions_for_entry_of_persons_to.html). Provincial and territorial documents typically mean sweet fuck all to the rest of world.  The same logic guides the use of domestic vaccine passports.

A Chicago physician wrote in 1901 that “Vaccination should be the seal on the passport of entrance to the public schools, to the voters’ booth, to the box of the juryman, and to every position of duty, privilege, profit or honor in the gift of either the State or the Nation.”  &gt; Employers across the country acted to make smallpox immunity a condition of employment. Factories, mines, railroads and other industrial workplaces with tight quarters were particularly forceful in demanding proof of vaccination. In 1903, Maine’s government decreed that “no person be allowed to enter the employ of, or work in, a lumber camp who can not show a good vaccination scar. Though workers sometimes resisted, corporations and governments usually ensured that they took the vaccine in the end.  &gt; Social gatherings and clubs, too, sometimes required proof of vaccination in order to attend. When smallpox swept through Kansas City in 1921, one newspaper reported that “‘Show a scar’ has been officially adopted as the passwords to lodges and other meetings.” Public school leaders across the country also required students to present a “plain scar, the records of a school or a certificate by a reputable physician” in order to enter their institutions. Among others, the superintendent of the Savannah, Ga., school system in 1897 arranged for students to be provided with “admission cards” to their school once they provided proof of vaccination.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/pa7s0k/bc_becomes_second_province_to_require_proof_of/ha2spfl/

This plan is based on advice from our public health officials with priority placed on the safety and security of all Canadians.   &gt;   &gt;For Canadians who decide to travel, using a proof of vaccination will provide foreign border officials with the vaccination history needed to assess whether a traveller meets their public health requirements and provide a trusted and verifiable credential for when they return home.   &gt;   &gt;Travellers will be able to submit their proof of vaccination in ArriveCAN (mobile app or Canada.ca/ArriveCAN) when coming back to Canada.

136,0,1626211425,"It makes sense politically because of the high chance of it going sideways and is in line with the deflecting attitude intrinsic in the political class. For the sake of the country it will cause problems since each province is bound to have different rules on their use (if they come about at all). In Ontario, we're used to Quebec setting the minimum age for legally buying alcohol at 18 years rather than 19 years. It was pretty common for us to drunkenly celebrate our 18th birthdays in Montreal. If the difference in the use of domestic vaccine passports varies enough from one province/territory to the next, then there could be some problems with people jumping borders or even grassroots protests to set up a ""level playing field"" since these will go beyond the mere age for legally buying booze.  However, he and the rest of the Feds **need** to get their asses in gear about vaccine passports for international travel. No excuses or deflecting to the provinces and territories. The explanation for this follows.  ===  Because of the current lack of an international standard for vaccination, we have a lot less mobility than our full vaccination status would suggest. For example, the Czech Republic does not currently deem *any* Canadian to be fully vaccinated. The only way for us to have a chance at entering right now hassle-free (if at all) is to fill in a registration form and give proof of a negative PCR test that's no more than 72 hours old before take-off time OR proof of a negative PCR test result within 5 days of arriving in the country.  This is all because the Czech government will **not** accept anything other than certain nationally-backed certificates of vaccination. The default .pdf for vaccination issued by the province means *absolutely zero* to the Czechs. This should make you realize that Canada is a real oddball by explicitly setting up healthcare as a regional/provincial responsibility rather than putting it under federal/national control as is typical in Europe and Asia.  From the [Czech embassy's webpage](https://www.mzv.cz/ottawa/en/news_and_events/the_conditions_for_entry_of_persons_to.html) right now:  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;As from July 12, 2021, Canada is considered as a country with a low risk of COVID-19 transmission (green country). Canadian citizens may enter the Czech Republic for any reason (return to home, tourism, travel to work or for study, family visit, etc.)   &gt;   &gt;...   &gt;   &gt;The provincial vaccination certificates from Canada are not recognisedby the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic. Here you can find a list of recognised certificates.  Recognized vaccination certificates so far are those from other EU members, Israel, Serbia and the UK. Note that these are all nationally-backed certifications. It's not as if someone from Wales would get a Welsh vaccination certificate instead of one from the NHS and backed by the UK.  [The list](https://koronavirus.mzcr.cz/certifikaty/) of acceptable certificates is unfortunately in Czech only (but I do understand it as a speaker of Slovak) and Canada isn't on the list. The Czech government does note that the European Commission is currently working out details with at least 30 other countries on how those other citizens can prove their full vaccination status to an acceptable standard for hassle-free entry to the Czech Republic. Who knows when this will actually be sorted out with Canada. I interpret this acknowledgement based on the following statement in Czech.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Evropská komise momentálně jedná s více jak 30 zeměmi o vzájemné kompatibilitě certifikátů prokazujících prodělané očkování.

163,0,1621597315,"Opinion piece advocating for adoption of framework similar to EU for border re-opening, with some sort of vaccine passport until the pandemic has passed.  Article notes that given the higher percentage of Americans fully vaccinated, the opening of the border will initially mean a one-way flow of Americans into Canada.  The authors observed this will give a much needed boost in the arm to Canadian businesses in the hospitality sector.   Paywall,  excerpts from article  &gt;... the next item on the agenda is the border.   &gt;   &gt;When can it reopen? To whom? And under what conditions?   &gt;   &gt;When the pandemic hit in March, 2020, the sort-of closing of the U.S.-Canada border was one of the jolts that registered the severity of the crisis. It was announced as an agreement to “temporarily restrict all non-essential travel.” While the two countries have started talking about how to ease the vise, the closure will last until at least June 21.   &gt;   &gt;Canada’s borders have been an endless source of pandemic consternation. The rules against non-essential travel eviscerated the tourism sector, yet for 14 months large numbers of people have continued to arrive from  the United States and elsewhere, many exploiting the multitude of  loopholes in the Liberal government’s hotel quarantine rules, themselves  only brought in half-heartedly, in response to public pressure.   &gt;   &gt;At the same time, Ottawa has insisted on imposing quarantine on fully  vaccinated travellers, and on Thursday said it would do the same with  Canadians who, for the sake of getting vaccinated, step even one metre across the U.S. border.   &gt;   &gt;...   &gt;   &gt;On Wednesday, the European Union laid out its framework. The 27 EU states will reopen their borders as soon as next week to  visitors from countries with very low virus counts, and other travellers  who are fully vaccinated. The fully vaccinated will not have to    quarantine.   &gt;   &gt;Individual European states may impose tighter restrictions, and the EU  further stands ready to pull an emergency brake on travel from any place  with a sudden outbreak. Europe is also working to create a “digital green certificate” – a vaccine passport.   &gt;   &gt;...   &gt;   &gt;Canadian and American officials have started talks to figure out what the arrangements should be for screening people who cross the world’s longest international border.   &gt;   &gt;A key question is whether the fully vaccinated should be allowed to  bypass quarantine obligations. Knowledge of the virus is evolving but,  from what is known so far, allowing the fully vaccinated to travel,  without the need to spend two weeks in isolation, makes sense.   &gt;   &gt;...   &gt;   &gt;Some worry that vaccine passports, or any requirement to prove  vaccination in order to travel, is an invasion of privacy. The debate  often blurs the line between requiring them domestically – such as to  attend a concert – versus at a border.   &gt;   &gt;...   &gt;   &gt;In the long run, proof of vaccination for travellers will hopefully  become unnecessary, thanks to the pandemic being stamped out. But that’s  a question for 2022 and beyond. As a bridge between now and then, and  to allow travel to safely restart, Canada needs to be able to verify the  vaccination status of anyone crossing the border.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/nhq5l5/globe_editorial_what_canada_and_canadians_need_to/gyxl4o9/

If they are not going to open it now when the USA and Canada have 50% of the population with 1st doses, why can't they tell us the vaccination rate, case numbers, etc required to re-open and give us a plan?  Also it's pretty simple to set up a vaccine certificate that Canada accept from Americans. Give the Canadian Border Agency a system to access the CDC vaccinated database, and cross check it at the land border with the American's license/passport name using the ArriveCAN app.  I'm tired of not being able to see my family when I'm fully vaccinated and there isn't even a plan to safely re-open.

So how come all Canadian citizens are allowed to fly into the USA on a plane and all they require is a negative PCR test? Meanwhile us fully vaccinated Americans can’t see our loved ones, family, friends, or tend to our property in Canada.   The length of the trip is definitely relevant because it shows the incompetency and inexistent leadership of both governments. The USA and Europe have already agreed to create a travel corridor for vaccinated citizens using a digital vaccine certificate.  Meanwhile there is ZERO official statements or even a re-opening plan from Canada, our closest ally who we share the biggest land border with and are inextricably linked together as 2 countries. It’s pretty easy to lift the travel ban an open the border to allow fully vaccinated Americans to go to Canada and just require them to wear masks. It can easily be done with the ArriveCAN app.   No more blanket border shutdowns for 1 year and 4 months. No more mental health crisis of separating loved ones.
