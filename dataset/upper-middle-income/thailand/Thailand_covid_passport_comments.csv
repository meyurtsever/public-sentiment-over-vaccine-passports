At one point, they started turning away people who's visas expired in February, telling them to ""come back next week"" and reassuring them that it's all good even though the scheme ended on the 25th. That's when I knew that they got word that it was going to be extended.  People with visas expiring in January were told to ""come back tomorrow"".  Mine expired in Feb but I'd booked online which saved me from being kicked out.  Here's the link for that: [https://www.immigration.go.th/?page\_id=20131](https://www.immigration.go.th/?page_id=20131)  Queue online and arrive early so as to not cause issues. You should be able to bypass the queue of people, go directly to the desk, and show them the e-mail that you get after you make a booking. That'll save you a lot of time.  I've been here for 23 months extending every time and I used to write ""flights cancelled due to covid"" in my form. I was questioned on 4 occasions. One lady accused me of working here. The same one also questioned my ability to return home another time. Another (the angry one) questioned how I support myself and another time accused me of providing a false address. Asides from causing issues over nothing and being angry power trippers in general, that's about as serious as it ever got with the immigration ladies at MTT.  Here's how it all went down originally. I arrived at the start of March 2020. Before it was time to go, I went to MTT to get my extension. It was chaos, highly confusing, and it took forever. They had it in the big multi-storey car park next to the skyscraper, not in that little office building that hosts them now. The process took all day. You could get there, be sent to the 5th floor, and then they'd send row by row lower as people got processed. Eventually as the tourist numbers died down, they stopped hosting it there and moved it to the little building.   Initially it was a monthly stamp thing, then they changed it to 2 months, but they'd only give you a 2-week stamp after you'd paid and had your paperwork processed. After the 2 weeks you'd go back with just your passport and they'd stamp another 6 weeks onto it. This eventually changed to giving you the full 2 months on the first visit.  For some months, depending on the time you went, you could walk into the building and you'd be the only person there, or there'd be a few other people max. I think the fastest I've been in and out is about 10 minutes. It helped that I had a stamp that wasn't on the 1st of the month as that's when it was busiest. You may be able to push your stamp out by overstaying a day but I'm not sure any more.  It's been a wild ride of worrying that I'll be rejected of the scheme won't be renewed. I'm going to be changing to a marriage visa this time round to avoid any possible issues as it sounds like they're getting serious about it all. Strange that they want tourism to return, but don't want tourists staying in the country spending money.  I know that 23 months is extreme in my case, I'm not complaining.",Thailand,t5_2qjw5,/r/Thailand/comments/sejpil/updated_info_for_60_day_covid_extensions_anyone/huojlvw/
2,0,1643203714,"So much wrong and idiotic in your sour grapes response, but I think it will be educational to others if I respond point by point. I must say that I don't think I have ever seen a post in which every enumerated point was flatly wrong.  First off, I am not trading anything. I don't have to give up my US citizenship. Look up dual citizenship. India doesn't allow it, but they do allow citizens who obtain foreign citizenship to obtain a status that is pretty much the same. About the only important thing they cannot do is own agricultural land. I know, because I just spoke to an Indian who obtained Thai citizenship and he went through that process. You might want to check that out so you are more informed in the future.   a. PR is expensive, time consuming, and takes years. In any case, not necessary if you are married. Process averages 3-4 years start to finish.  b. It is not always easy to start a company under the US treaty, and many things are still prohibited. And it costs money and time. And reams of documentation.  c. Sure you have the right to stay under an O visa, which you need to apply for each year, and report every 90 days, etc. No more need for me to do that. At all. BTW, I can now enter Burma, Cambodia, Laos and some other countries visa free, which I could not do before. I can still use my US passport when overseas as that is perfectly legal and acceptable. Enter and leave Thailand with your Thai passport, and you can use whichever one you want overseas.   d. No need for me to negotiate for a higher pay package as I am mostly self employed. My part time Thai employer could care less. They pay me for the skill they need, not because I am a foreigner or Thai.  e. There is no requirement to renounce my US citizenship. The US government isn't accepting that anyway for the last several years, ostensibly because of COVID.  f. My kids are US citizens. My citizenship status doesn't affect their ability to immigrate to the US in any way whatsoever.   **Reread this until you understand this:**  Why would Thais see me as anything other than a farang? Citizenship doesn't change your ethnicity. I am a Thai citizen, with all the rights and responsibilities that entails. I am not ethnically Thai. What a nonsensical argument. I am sorry your experience here has evidently not been as pleasant a one as mine. You seem bitter than you are ethnically Indian. Why is that I wonder?  Throughout my time here, and throughout this process, I have never met a single Thai who had an issue with my living here or becoming a Thai citizenship. Not one. Every, and I mean EVERY, Thai official I dealt with during this process were extremely encouraging. And throughout the years I could not count the number of Thais who asked me why I hadn't changed my citizenship.  There are just too many benefits of my holding Thai citizenship to list here.",Thailand,t5_2qjw5,/r/Thailand/comments/sd1jjq/has_anyone_actually_succeed_at_becoming_a/huahj2e/

If you have to prove your income, you will need to have the status of a regular employee living abroad for the company in your home country.  For me, a digital nomad is a person who has broken all the official connections with his home country and needs nothing back. They pay no taxes and don't demand support from the home country in social security.  They work for companies organizations, but there is no official contract.   Most of the (European/Belgian/Netherlands digital nomads I know:  - the ask for a new international passport  - inform their home country that they leave  - and stay under the radar for 6 1/2 years. (They have to renew their passport after 7 years)  Most countries have a law that you need to inform the government that you leave, but you are not forced to tell them where you go or stay.  After 6 1/2 years, they inform the local embassy that they are in their jurisdiction, and if needed, register at the embassy and ask for a new passport. Or they go, for a short time, back to their home country for a new passport.  They work but are paid in Bitcoin or Monero. There is no official registration of their income.  To stay in Thailand, they follow the official ""rules."" Long-term based on education, or married with a Thai partner, or before covid, the border runs.   For me, this is entirely different than a person who works officially for a (European) company and has his salary on a European bank account.  Most people who use a European bank have to inform the bank of their official address outside Europe. (And several banks in the Netherlands and Belgium start to close the accounts if you live outside the European Monetary Union)  Or they have to inform their government where they live because they have to pay taxes on their income.  For them, it will be easy to prove the Thai government their official income, but are you still a digital nomad?

Only jpeg and png are accepted.

After submitting my application I immediately received an email confirmation that my application had been received, and 30 seconds (!) later received a second email saying I have been approved, with my Thailand Pass and QR attached as a PDF.

My situation:   I am South African and we only have around 200 covid cases a day atm but still we are considered a medium risk zone even though some European countries are at 25 000+ a day and low risk... don't understand that logic. Anyway so we needed to apply for the sandbox setup.  You can imagine how stressed we were about our vaccine certificate QR code not being recognised because South Africa is usually behind on everything or not even thought about before the richer countries so there was very little faith it would go through smoothly.  We uploaded through: - Gmail,  - Used ordinary passport - South African vaccine certificate + separate pic of vaccine QR code. Our vaccine certificate showed our ID numbers but not passport numbers (so I wouldn't worry about editing that in like some people have)  - For accomadation we just used our SHABA certificate which we requested from sha+ hotel and entered the SHABA number provided  into the booking ID part. - AXA insurance certificate showed specifically that covid is covered.   I was honestly the most stressed and strung out I have ever been, I registered a few times on different emails, because I was so scared I had done something wrong. I called my countries Thai embassy who could not help, I tried calling that helpline they provided but noone answered, couldnt sleep or eat.. But my girlfriend remained calm and only made one application without reapplying 50 times like me and at the end of the day we both got the approvals and she got hers 1 hour before me!!  That being said, the best advice I can offer is; STAY CALM. I have not seen many cases of anyone being out right denied yet, we are all rightfully stressing because we are in the first few weeks of the system operating and are essentially guinea pigs! I know it sucks but it had to start somewhere and I truly believe that as long as you made your application with at least 3 full working days to go I am pretty certain they will approve you!   One thing that I noticed did go through is the email to support@tp.consular.go.th they only answered me straight after I had been approved and said that I am already approved - lol-  but it was confirmation that the email line does indeed work! You must just make sure to give your full name, passport number and arrival date at the start if your email.

Technically, regardless of location you can only do one 30 day extension, this is stamped into your passport and takes up almost half a page. Depending on how things line up you may be able to get the 60 day COVID extension but it’s not as much of a sure thing as the standard 30 day extension.  Keep in mind that you still need a 4x6 cm passport style photo, photocopies of both your information page, and any Thai stamps in your passport related to your current stay, in addition to 1900 baht exactly.  3.

46,1,1635698575,"First, when you go to immigration, be sure you understand that what you likely have is a visa exempt entry, not a visa on arrival. Visa Exempt is when they just stamp your passport for 30 days when you arrive. Visa on Arrival is a separate scheme that is required for passport-holders from about 20 countries that don't qualify for Visa Exempt, like India and China, and requires that you apply and pay for a visa at the special kiosk at the airport when you land.   Second, as others have pointed out, visa exempt, tourist visas, and visa on arrival can only be extended one time for 30 days. The covid extension is a special program that is set to expire on 26 November currently unless they extend it further. It grants 60 days and is renewable repeatedly as long as the covid extension program continues. However, immigration only grants the 60 day covid extension after you get your normal 30 day extension. So, given that you haven't gotten the 30 day extension yet, the covid extension program is currently set to expire before your 30 day extension would end, so you likely won't be able to get that extension.   As far as immigration office, you will have to go to Samui and there are plenty of ferries between the islands.

HOWEVER, option B may cause some issues as airline staff are sometimes not trained well to handle this situation and it may delay her check-in or cause her to miss her flight if they have to keep checking with supervisors to try to understand what to do.

The first time i was out in around 45 minutes or so.  Second shot, i was there for 2 hours.  To get to the 9th floor you wait for really slow elevators as people gather all around you. Then everyone crams into the elevator up to the 9th floor.  The entire process is indoors in a narrow L shaped corridor.  There were 9 stops.  9. No reason it couldn't have been 2 or 3. Besides the around 150 or so numbers I heard called while i was there, there were dozens of workers (no wonder all these health workers keep testing positive).  Most of them were unnecessary and shouldn't have been there.  There were no accommodations for covid, it was just the usual snap the ""system"" into place and it hopefully fits what you're trying to do.  The number of people up there and the time spent there should have been limited at every chance.  Nothing was cut out and it could have just as easily been a pre-covid event.  And I don't think the spacing between chairs was sufficient at all.  But it doesn't even matter as much when you are in an enclosed space like that, worsened by the crowds.  The 30 mns waiting time should have been cut out for safety concerns. If someone feels unwell, they can return.  People should have been let go and allowed to remain in the area or not far away.  I've never had more than a cup of orange juice and sent away when vaccinated in the past.   Then i get handed a pathetic little piece if paper that says ""Thailand certificate "" for covid vaccine.  It's useless.  Then i was told I had to go to one of only three places to get a vaccine ""passport"". So i had to travel to nonthaburi arrived at 6AM and spent another 3 hours indoors with more people not really respecting social distancing.  One lady checks the papers, then you hand them to a lady at a window at 6.30. At 8 am she calls your name and hands them back to you, telling you to go upstairs where you start again.
