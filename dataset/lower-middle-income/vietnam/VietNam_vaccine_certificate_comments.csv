6,0,1632231547,Thanks for the info. I’m not sure if that just relates to people who have been vaccinated in Vietnam and have missing vaccine data. I’ve submitted my UK vaccine certificate via the link below but I’m doubtful it will work:  https://tiemchungcovid19.gov.vn/portal/portal-report  Understand the government will be focused on Vietnamese citizens and Vietnamese vaccine records but just wondered if anyone had heard anything specific to foreigners vaccinated abroad.,VietNam,t5_2qkcr,/r/VietNam/comments/psibzx/has_anyone_vaccinated_abroad_managed_to_get_a/hdpsyjq/

9,1,1631414145,"Here's a google translation:  &gt;Dear compatriots,  The government of Ho Chi Minh City intends from today to all foreigners who live in Ho Chi Minh City (this means all 21 districts and rural districts of Ho Chi Minh City as well as the city of Thu Duc)  to submit a vaccination offer.  The responsible authorities at the place of residence will carry out the vaccination.  Please register by September 15, 2021 at the latest using the web form provided by the Vietnamese authorities1.  You will then receive an invitation to the vaccination appointment by e-mail or SMS, stating the time and place of the vaccination.  This invitation serves as a pass to get to the vaccination center.  So please have them available for possible controls at checkpoints.  We have not received any further information on the documents to be submitted, but we recommend that you carry your passport with you.  If you have a yellow vaccination certificate (WHO sample), bring it with you and ask expressly to register the vaccination.  Please note: One registration per person is sufficient.  Since the vaccination campaign is organized and carried out by the Vietnamese authorities, the Consulate General cannot provide you with any further information beyond what was communicated in this message, nor can it have any influence on the timing or the type of vaccine used.  On the following page we are again sending you the offer for free telemedical advice for foreigners in English and French.  Sincerely, Your Consulate General",VietNam,t5_2qkcr,/r/VietNam/comments/pmkgfr/vaccination_registration_for_foreigners_until/hcijg9r/

16,0,1630832237,"Photo 1 is taken at around 2:10pm. According to the group chat of my apartment, we expected a mass testing at 2pm. However, as you guys can see: there is no testing team yet.  Photo 2 is taken from the intersection within Photo 1. Same time ish. The street running horizontally here would be the place where the mass testing takes place.  Photo 3 is my ""testing card"" (of sort), taken at 2:45pm (when the testers finally arrive). I would fill in the details (name, year of birth, gender...) and then hand back to the tester team. A bit miffed that it is not electronic-based (and conversation, when I was taking Photo 1 and 2, showed that the electronic certificate for vaccine fro some people is ""late""), but there are quite a number of elders in my khu phố.  Photo 4 is when I am standing in line. Personally: I'm quite impressed with the degree of self-organise here. Two (moderately straight) lines, for two testing stations. Each station has 3 to 4 testers (1 writing, 1 doing the test, and 1 supporter). No hunkering together. Everyone with masks (and proper wearing), 2m (ish) from each other. Elders were prioritized for testing first.. Just cost me about 30s to do the actual testing and about 5 min for queuing.   And for reference: The testers apply liberal amount of alcohol to clean their gloves (and it looks like they change the gloves after 10 testee or so). It is ""mass testing"", so each has their own sample stick, but 5 to 10 people would share the same tube (for actual analysing in the lab)  Expected result time: 3 days (as I overheard). And if someone knocks on my door, it means I'm positive. And if no one knocks? I'm negative, and I should keep up the usual safety measures.",VietNam,t5_2qkcr,/r/VietNam/comments/pi9ixg/mass_testing_in_my_khu_phố_more_details_in_my/hbo1xx7/

18,0,1630044189,"A few other comments  * I register for the vaccine via the 1st website, then via my company, then via my local authorities (ward level). It takes me about... 1 month (maybe less, it's hard to judge the time when you stay indoors 24/7) to finally get the vaccine via my company. A week later,my ward also announce the vaccine stuff  * I download the app after my vaccine. So I don't know for sure if it can help you registering for the vaccine faster. However, it WILL give you the certificate for vaccine faster (the day after compared to the website's the week after)  Vaccination for foreigners is guaranteed by the gov. But down to the site, there may be some miscommunication (at least, as of 2 weeks ago, before the current full lockdown in HCMC) on this regards. A member in this sub has also suffered from it, but it was cleared out quickly (he has the ward level official) and he got the vaccine afterwards.

I have seen many migrants get the shot but all were teachers so I don’t know where a non teacher migrant can apply. Would have preferred pfizer or moderna but Happy I got my vaccine as the risks outweigh the very small risk. The place I went to was in district 2 and was very well done. A school with a lot of open places. They set up chairs with good distance, everybody had to bring their own pen prevent sharing of materials. Covid nose swab test first, wait for 30 min, get blood and temp checked, get shot, get certificate and proceed to a different exit without crossing people who are still waiting.
