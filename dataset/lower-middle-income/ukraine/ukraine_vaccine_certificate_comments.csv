2,0,1637491811,"Wasn't aiming my comment at you, but at the general state of ""what if russia invades"" IT DID, in 2014. But foreign news tried to make it seem like it's some Martians from outer space just backed by russia or something.   &gt;the numbers of fatalities throughout this conflict are much much lower than potential ones in hypothetical open all out war  That's the CEASEFIRE casualties. Cease fire. Has them bomb us dozen of times every day. And then Germany or France whines if Ukraine fires back.  Another problem is that it's hybrid war. They found a very effective weapon that kills much more than russian artillery could dream off: antivaxxers. Russians use insane amounts of money on disinformation campaign and since pandemic started they've been working full time on providing COVID disinformation. Actually several statements by investigators and tons of research backing it up.  It also explains a statistical anomaly: why the hell is Ukraine the lowest-vaccinated country in Europe? It's SIGNIFICANTLY behind others, probably the only state where there's so many idiots paying money to get a fake certificate instead of getting a free vaccine and spend whole 20 seconds in a mobile app to get certified. Here you go, SBU apprehended antivaxxers working for Kremlin: https://imi.org.ua/en/news/charges-pressed-against-russia-handled-anti-vaxxers-who-aimed-to-seize-power-ukrinform-i42393  A typical anti-vax group leader passport: https://www.jpost.com/international/ukraine-says-it-thwarted-plan-by-anti-vaxxers-to-destabilize-country-685309 P.S. REALLY hate their narrative overall, they're the worst kind of news, the ""happy pretender"" ones, not only apprehending some of many disinformation networks doesn't thwart the entire plan, just throws a spanner there, but also their attitude of a ""possible"", ""future"" invasion instead of ongoing war that might be escalated. If people actually used the right words, i.e. a ""full scale offensive campaign"" instead of ""starting an invasion"", it would be less confusing to people who don't follow Ukrainian news for yeats.  Another article on the overall shebang, citing real good sources: https://www.codastory.com/disinformation/ukraine-vaccine-hesitancy/  On bright side, russians do get hoisted by their own petard too: https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/covid-19-disinformation-backfires-russian-deaths-climb-eu-says-2021-10-21/   So yes, they can kill way more people if they use aircraft and/or lead another full scale offensive like in 2014 or 15, but the most effective weapon is the ""vaccine skepticism,"" with way higher mortality rate than any war. Literally daily deaths from COVID are higher than yearly death toll from the war.   UKRAINE IS SECOND BY DAILY CORONA DEATHS IN THE WORLD, only behind russia: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ (click ""yesterday"" tab for full statistics). And since our population is less than half of their, per capita, we're actually leading... Their disinformation WORKS. Yeah our army needs to reinforce borders and go over several plans of defense, get equipped and ready for any scenario - that goes without given, it's their job... but #1 priority is not fucking dying out from a preventable illness.

I also heard about the part of neurological side effects (canâ€˜t move leg or arm) but I donâ€˜t know anyone who is affected.  Yesterday we were in Globus Mall and in every shop they asked us if we can show them a certificate.

4,0,1633905497,"Zero trust in government and medicine, that's what. I always said that for real *reforms*, we need to give Uliana Suprun a ***large chainsaw***.  Yesterday got my 2nd dose of vaccine, and *medpersonnel at reception were wearing masks below the nose.* Despite processing many people by mid-day, they still somehow pointed me the wrong way (you need doctor to sign the pamphlet before getting the jab, and people who give said pamphlet literally told me to go ""behind the curtain"" first, from where the nurse quickly directed me back to doctor who was too busy chatting and had to call for another random doctor to sign the paperwork).   Then, after getting my second dose of Pfizer, nobody in the vaccination center knew where to input the data so it would get into my documents, or Diya app. It appears, the doctors who aren't chatting simply don't know how to use computers... Odessa, urban European city with million population, 2021. We live in bureaucratic hell that digitized records without having devices to access said records, the clinic I went to before that literally couldn't access everything because there was a blackout at their ISP for a week. Need surgery? Wait till they fix the internet.  The amount of doctors who defend use of placebo to fool patients ""because they will not understand anyway and want more medicine"" is astounding. Fake diagnoses (literally not existing outside of ex-USSR) are rampant and antibiotics prescribed against viral illnesses at random is the norm.  One time I had to get an ultrasound scan, after visiting two clinics that were out of personnel, in a central regional hospital, avoiding the breaking chairs that a guy with both legs broken had to stand near. I got what I wanted after waiting for doctor who randomly locked herself in room for an hour with no clients, but since reception didn't ask from people to wear masks (unlike McDonalds, who know better medicine than doctors, apparently) as they were coughing, my scan cost me a week of respiratory illness (I already went through long COVID by that point from a heavy coughing maskless delivery driver who was bragging he didn't stop working when sick â€“ irony is I ordered online to avoid people's sneezes and coughs during pandemic).  So, by this point, most people learned that if you want to stay healthy, you avoid doctors and especially hospitals where you're basically guaranteed to catch something extra on top of what you had already. My friend almost died from coronavirus and 42 C fever for weeks, but stayed at home, self-isolating. He refuses to get vaccinated after seeing Ukrainian BBC and other news report on one guy who died following vaccination (corellation/causation be damned). So international media is actively sabotaging vaccination as well, and add shitty healthcare system and you get less than 15% cleared.  Some extra special idiots pay exorbitant amounts of money to get a vaccine certificate (vaccination is free) without getting a jab, and guess who helps them sign and register them... (yup, doctors).  **WE NEED A VERY BIG CHAINSAW.**",ukraine,t5_2qqcn,/r/ukraine/comments/q5cdlx/15_whats_wrong_with_these_people/hg5rsdk/
