I flew out of JFK airport in New York, and was asked to provide proof of my negative PCR test when I checked in for my flight. I had gotten my test at CVS and there was no problem with it, but my wife had gotten hers at the hospital, and it didn't specifically say it was PCR. So she paid extra and got a PCR test preemtively at the airport. We had our results on our phones, and she said we had to email them to her, so we could get them printed. The check-in person from Aeroflot said we should keep our negative PCR printouts because we would be asked to hand them over see the end of the flight. When we got past passport control in Moscow there was a folding table with a couple of guys at it. They were stacking up the papers as people went by, but not paying much attention to if they caught everybody.  As far as the flight from Moscow to the US is concerned, we got our PCR tests at СМД. The woman there asked if the test was for a flight, and we said yes, so she got the results emailed to us both in Russian and English. We printed then at our friends' apartment before we went to the airport. At Sheremetevo, the Aeroflot check-in person asked for them, and she also asked to see our cards from when we got the coronavirus vaccine in the US. Then we got on the plane and nobody asked to see anything about the PCR test on the other end when we arrived in New York.",russia,t5_2qh75,/r/russia/comments/r6i892/any_tourist_to_russia_lately_have_experiences/hpdpaor/

2,0,1638380913,"Okay so native Russian friend got back to me, that place requires a passport with either work permission or temporary living permission, which I don't think tourist visa's count as. They are closed for tonight but I'll write them an email and have a friend try and contact them tomorrow. Special living permission is apparently a different document that tourists do not receive.      So far its seeming as I feared: there is basically no way for a foreign tourist to get a QR code without PCR tests. I'm happy to have my mind changed, however.

3,0,1635704247,"As a person from NA who’s currently here in Russia, the simple answer is that you can’t.  Only way to get it is by getting shot of the vaccine in Russia (Sputnik, not sure about the other 2).  I got Pfizer, the best you can do is to have the proof of vaccination of Pfizer, along with your passport.  Some places may allow you to enter, some will refuse. All depends on the mood of the workers at the establishment.  For foreigners, you’d have better chance entering somewhere by doing PCR Test, which is probably the best option, besides actually getting covid vaccine again.",russia,t5_2qh75,/r/russia/comments/qju6ll/im_an_american_traveling_to_russia_for_the_first/hisi2zv/
