I'm starting over from scratch myself at 36, lost my life savings in the collapse and banks bankruptcy and my gym failed through 2 years of covid and economic meltdown.  I wasn't in the explosion vicinity. I had moved back to my hometown in zahle just a month before it because I couldn't afford beirut anymore. Like you my long term relationship fell apart after that because I'm not emotionally nor mentally available to anything or anyone nowadays.  I have no foreign passport to fall back on though, but managed to squeeze through a position in my old career outside lebanon, so we'll see if that works out.

3,3,0,1629276230,"&gt; Is it even possible to find a job in any European country, while living and applying from Lebanon? For example I have 3 years experience as a developer, but I only have the Lebanese passport..   This is very hard to do from here, especially now when there is an economic crisis everywhere in the world. Most go study there and then apply for jobs. The reason is that to get you there they have to both justify that they can't hire someone local that can do the same job, and they have to pay something like 2k€ to get your paperwork ready.  I have some friends who were lucky and moved there but it was before the crisis, even before covid...   Still, if you keep digging and applying non-stop you might get ""lucky""  and get a job if you tell them you'd work for peanuts.
