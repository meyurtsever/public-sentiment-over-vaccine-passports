Then using a paper clip attach a photocopy of front and bank of the CANDIDATE'S Pakistani ID card.

6,6,0,1631366612,"I understand your frustration but not everything is a conspiracy theory against Pakistan. Yes, there’s practically no travel between India and Pakistan but I was in Dubai back at end of April when things were getting out of hand in India, When I was flying back to Pakistan via the Fly Dubai terminal, hundreds of Indians and Pakistanis were seated together awaiting their respective flights and interacting with each other. If people aren’t taking our COVID numbers seriously, it’s because our government lacks credibility around the world not because it’s some ploy to ostracize us.   Ukraine is notorious for treating Pakistanis with a lot of contempt upon arrival because several Pakistanis who travel there only do so they can flee in to one of the bordering countries.   I was supposed to visit Russia this summer to attend a Euro cup game. Had my ticket and everything lined up. Was super excited. Guess what ? I didn’t end up going because a lot of people flying in from Pakistan ended up getting detained and being sent back. Among these were 18 or 19 year olds who had shown up with a mere hundred dollars on them not thinking they’d be vetted by immigration. What was their real purpose of travel ? The airline I was traveling with announce they weren’t to going to fly people to Russia traveling on the basis of Fan ID.

7,7,1,1631388408,"1) I'm so confused about the prestige of an Estonian medical degree, aren't their universities not even in the top 100? I know multiple Pakistani lecturers (with degrees from Pakistan) teaching at top 100 institutions, I personally studied from one. Don't stress about ""prestige,"" it's not Oxbridge or Ivy (which aren't special anyway, I have multiple colleagues from there and it didn't help them any more than me!)  2) Research point is fairly valid, however, you can always apply to do research after undergrad (and research degrees generally pay you to do them). I can personally confirm that I've seen multiple researchers from no-name universities, everywhere.  3) I don't have ADHD but I've lived in Europe and the medical care is quite good, albeit, most countries are similar (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, etc.) This is important when making a decision on where to study because all these places offer those benefits too.  4) True, you can provide a comfortable living for them doing just about anything abroad though. Medicine is expensive and takes quite a long time (you'll need to fund yourself until the $$$ rolls in).  5) A Pakistani passport isn't a burden, I've actively tried to keep mine because this passport is a part of my identity. You bite the hand that feeds you?  6) While it's good to be ambitious, Pakistan doesn't particularly need doctors more than, let's say, water security or agriculture workers.  My point being, you weren't born in South Sudan, we have fantastic universities in Pakistan that offer a wide range of degrees (many of which, lead people abroad anyway).
