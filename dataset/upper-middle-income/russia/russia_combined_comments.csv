From what I know, there is not usually an increased time for processing at the consular office, unless there are questions.  Your visa processing company will have the best answers for you.

Various processing companies will charge you for expedited visa service, but your passport (and completed application) still has to physically get to a Russian consular office.     And it's not just the time for the Russian consular office to process the application, it is also the shipping time from you to your processing company, and then back to you.  You might get it done by throwing money at it, but it's gonna be close and likely spendy.  Christmas and Covid are just gonna make mail and shipping slower.

I brought my passport, a printed out and digital version of negative Covid test,  the Rospotrebnadzor application, my Russian Visa and my insurance info (was not checked but is listed on the application form).  When entering this last time, they checked my passport, verified my visa, checked electronically to see that I had return tickets, took the application form, checked the Covid test and checked that I had a hotel listed as my place of stay on the application form.  Perhaps 5-8 minutes in total.  You get the migration card at that point and you are through.  A few things to highlight.  Be aware of the 6 month passport expiration rule.    You can download the application form from tourism.gov.ru and pre fill it out.  Otherwise you will be filling it out on the airplane as you descend into Russia.  If you have never seen one, the migration card is a little slip of paper, a bit smaller than your passport.  It is not a receipt or piece of random paper.

This can take between a few days and several weeks, assuming your application is approved.  There are services that will do that step for you (and help with completing the application) or you can travel to a suitable location and wait for the visa yourself.

It’s because relations are so bad that each country dismissed most of the other’s diplomatic staff (very stupid, but it is what it is). There may be other options, like going to a different country to get the visa, but if you want to go in the fall it might be too late.   The Covid situation adds an extra layer of complexity because you need a negative test 72 hours before takeoff to get on the plane and then TWO tests 24 hours apart when you arrive. The first you can take at the airport, but for the second you need to find a local clinic unless you plan to go to the airport two days in a row.   Knowing Russian would help immensely, especially since there aren’t a lot of tourists there right now.   There are no special dangers to Americans compared with other people. You may end up paying more for museums and such (last time I went they have the “normal” rate and the “discount” rate if you’re from one of the former Soviet republics).   The rest is basic travel safety - stay in a good area, protect your passport (though many places ask for ID, so you may need to carry it; make sure you have copies just in case). Have money in more than one place. Be aware of your surroundings and don’t look like an “easy target.” Have a contingency plan in case you lose your phone, wallet or documents. Not trying to scare you and this is not specific to Russia. All major cities of the world have their small share of unsavory individuals that look for opportunities to exploit others or steal things when you’re not paying attention to your surroundings.

I was in a bordering province recently and the people there told me that only commercial vehicles (e.g., shipments of goods) are being let through.   If normal border travel resumes between Russia and Belarus but entry for US passport holders into Russia does not, it would be illegal to go through the border. In normal times it is possible to cross the border without having your passport checked, but not guaranteed. If you were somehow to make it through, you would not have passed through Russian border security and would be in the country illegally. You would not have a Russian migration card or a stamp on your passport.
