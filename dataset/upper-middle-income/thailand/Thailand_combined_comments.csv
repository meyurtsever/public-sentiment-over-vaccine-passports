1,1,0,1643430818,"I went to Muang Thong Thani (Bangkok) on the 24th and it was Chaos. At one point, they started turning away people who's visas expired in February, telling them to ""come back next week"" and reassuring them that it's all good even though the scheme ended on the 25th. That's when I knew that they got word that it was going to be extended.  People with visas expiring in January were told to ""come back tomorrow"".  Mine expired in Feb but I'd booked online which saved me from being kicked out.  Here's the link for that: [https://www.immigration.go.th/?page\_id=20131](https://www.immigration.go.th/?page_id=20131)  Queue online and arrive early so as to not cause issues. You should be able to bypass the queue of people, go directly to the desk, and show them the e-mail that you get after you make a booking. That'll save you a lot of time.  I've been here for 23 months extending every time and I used to write ""flights cancelled due to covid"" in my form. I was questioned on 4 occasions. One lady accused me of working here. The same one also questioned my ability to return home another time. Another (the angry one) questioned how I support myself and another time accused me of providing a false address. Asides from causing issues over nothing and being angry power trippers in general, that's about as serious as it ever got with the immigration ladies at MTT.  Here's how it all went down originally. I arrived at the start of March 2020. Before it was time to go, I went to MTT to get my extension. It was chaos, highly confusing, and it took forever. They had it in the big multi-storey car park next to the skyscraper, not in that little office building that hosts them now. The process took all day. You could get there, be sent to the 5th floor, and then they'd send row by row lower as people got processed. Eventually as the tourist numbers died down, they stopped hosting it there and moved it to the little building.   Initially it was a monthly stamp thing, then they changed it to 2 months, but they'd only give you a 2-week stamp after you'd paid and had your paperwork processed. After the 2 weeks you'd go back with just your passport and they'd stamp another 6 weeks onto it. This eventually changed to giving you the full 2 months on the first visit.  For some months, depending on the time you went, you could walk into the building and you'd be the only person there, or there'd be a few other people max. I think the fastest I've been in and out is about 10 minutes. It helped that I had a stamp that wasn't on the 1st of the month as that's when it was busiest. You may be able to push your stamp out by overstaying a day but I'm not sure any more.  It's been a wild ride of worrying that I'll be rejected of the scheme won't be renewed. I'm going to be changing to a marriage visa this time round to avoid any possible issues as it sounds like they're getting serious about it all. Strange that they want tourism to return, but don't want tourists staying in the country spending money.

2,2,0,1643203714,"So much wrong and idiotic in your sour grapes response, but I think it will be educational to others if I respond point by point. I must say that I don't think I have ever seen a post in which every enumerated point was flatly wrong.  First off, I am not trading anything. I don't have to give up my US citizenship. Look up dual citizenship. India doesn't allow it, but they do allow citizens who obtain foreign citizenship to obtain a status that is pretty much the same. About the only important thing they cannot do is own agricultural land. I know, because I just spoke to an Indian who obtained Thai citizenship and he went through that process. You might want to check that out so you are more informed in the future.   a. PR is expensive, time consuming, and takes years. In any case, not necessary if you are married. Process averages 3-4 years start to finish.  b. It is not always easy to start a company under the US treaty, and many things are still prohibited. And it costs money and time. And reams of documentation.  c. Sure you have the right to stay under an O visa, which you need to apply for each year, and report every 90 days, etc. No more need for me to do that. At all. BTW, I can now enter Burma, Cambodia, Laos and some other countries visa free, which I could not do before. I can still use my US passport when overseas as that is perfectly legal and acceptable. Enter and leave Thailand with your Thai passport, and you can use whichever one you want overseas.   d. No need for me to negotiate for a higher pay package as I am mostly self employed. My part time Thai employer could care less. They pay me for the skill they need, not because I am a foreigner or Thai.  e. There is no requirement to renounce my US citizenship. The US government isn't accepting that anyway for the last several years, ostensibly because of COVID.  f. My kids are US citizens. My citizenship status doesn't affect their ability to immigrate to the US in any way whatsoever.   **Reread this until you understand this:**  Why would Thais see me as anything other than a farang? Citizenship doesn't change your ethnicity. I am a Thai citizen, with all the rights and responsibilities that entails. I am not ethnically Thai. What a nonsensical argument. I am sorry your experience here has evidently not been as pleasant a one as mine. You seem bitter than you are ethnically Indian. Why is that I wonder?  Throughout my time here, and throughout this process, I have never met a single Thai who had an issue with my living here or becoming a Thai citizenship. Not one. Every, and I mean EVERY, Thai official I dealt with during this process were extremely encouraging. And throughout the years I could not count the number of Thais who asked me why I hadn't changed my citizenship.  There are just too many benefits of my holding Thai citizenship to list here.",Thailand,t5_2qjw5,/r/Thailand/comments/sd1jjq/has_anyone_actually_succeed_at_becoming_a/huahj2e/

Photocopies can be done at immigration for pocket change but you may be stuck in a long line depending on the office and time of day.

If you have to prove your income, you will need to have the status of a regular employee living abroad for the company in your home country.  For me, a digital nomad is a person who has broken all the official connections with his home country and needs nothing back. They pay no taxes and don't demand support from the home country in social security.  They work for companies organizations, but there is no official contract.   Most of the (European/Belgian/Netherlands digital nomads I know:  - the ask for a new international passport  - inform their home country that they leave  - and stay under the radar for 6 1/2 years. (They have to renew their passport after 7 years)  Most countries have a law that you need to inform the government that you leave, but you are not forced to tell them where you go or stay.  After 6 1/2 years, they inform the local embassy that they are in their jurisdiction, and if needed, register at the embassy and ask for a new passport. Or they go, for a short time, back to their home country for a new passport.  They work but are paid in Bitcoin or Monero. There is no official registration of their income.  To stay in Thailand, they follow the official ""rules."" Long-term based on education, or married with a Thai partner, or before covid, the border runs.   For me, this is entirely different than a person who works officially for a (European) company and has his salary on a European bank account.  Most people who use a European bank have to inform the bank of their official address outside Europe. (And several banks in the Netherlands and Belgium start to close the accounts if you live outside the European Monetary Union)  Or they have to inform their government where they live because they have to pay taxes on their income.  For them, it will be easy to prove the Thai government their official income, but are you still a digital nomad?

After submitting my application I immediately received an email confirmation that my application had been received, and 30 seconds (!) later received a second email saying I have been approved, with my Thailand Pass and QR attached as a PDF.

My situation:   I am South African and we only have around 200 covid cases a day atm but still we are considered a medium risk zone even though some European countries are at 25 000+ a day and low risk... don't understand that logic. Anyway so we needed to apply for the sandbox setup.  You can imagine how stressed we were about our vaccine certificate QR code not being recognised because South Africa is usually behind on everything or not even thought about before the richer countries so there was very little faith it would go through smoothly.  We uploaded through: - Gmail,  - Used ordinary passport - South African vaccine certificate + separate pic of vaccine QR code. Our vaccine certificate showed our ID numbers but not passport numbers (so I wouldn't worry about editing that in like some people have)  - For accomadation we just used our SHABA certificate which we requested from sha+ hotel and entered the SHABA number provided  into the booking ID part. - AXA insurance certificate showed specifically that covid is covered.   I was honestly the most stressed and strung out I have ever been, I registered a few times on different emails, because I was so scared I had done something wrong. I called my countries Thai embassy who could not help, I tried calling that helpline they provided but noone answered, couldnt sleep or eat.. But my girlfriend remained calm and only made one application without reapplying 50 times like me and at the end of the day we both got the approvals and she got hers 1 hour before me!!  That being said, the best advice I can offer is; STAY CALM. I have not seen many cases of anyone being out right denied yet, we are all rightfully stressing because we are in the first few weeks of the system operating and are essentially guinea pigs! I know it sucks but it had to start somewhere and I truly believe that as long as you made your application with at least 3 full working days to go I am pretty certain they will approve you!   One thing that I noticed did go through is the email to support@tp.consular.go.th they only answered me straight after I had been approved and said that I am already approved - lol-  but it was confirmation that the email line does indeed work!

Depending on how things line up you may be able to get the 60 day COVID extension but it’s not as much of a sure thing as the standard 30 day extension.

46,46,1,1635698575,"First, when you go to immigration, be sure you understand that what you likely have is a visa exempt entry, not a visa on arrival. Visa Exempt is when they just stamp your passport for 30 days when you arrive. Visa on Arrival is a separate scheme that is required for passport-holders from about 20 countries that don't qualify for Visa Exempt, like India and China, and requires that you apply and pay for a visa at the special kiosk at the airport when you land.   Second, as others have pointed out, visa exempt, tourist visas, and visa on arrival can only be extended one time for 30 days. The covid extension is a special program that is set to expire on 26 November currently unless they extend it further. It grants 60 days and is renewable repeatedly as long as the covid extension program continues. However, immigration only grants the 60 day covid extension after you get your normal 30 day extension. So, given that you haven't gotten the 30 day extension yet, the covid extension program is currently set to expire before your 30 day extension would end, so you likely won't be able to get that extension.   As far as immigration office, you will have to go to Samui and there are plenty of ferries between the islands.

Then everyone crams into the elevator up to the 9th floor.  The entire process is indoors in a narrow L shaped corridor.  There were 9 stops.  9. No reason it couldn't have been 2 or 3. Besides the around 150 or so numbers I heard called while i was there, there were dozens of workers (no wonder all these health workers keep testing positive).  Most of them were unnecessary and shouldn't have been there.  There were no accommodations for covid, it was just the usual snap the ""system"" into place and it hopefully fits what you're trying to do.  The number of people up there and the time spent there should have been limited at every chance.  Nothing was cut out and it could have just as easily been a pre-covid event.  And I don't think the spacing between chairs was sufficient at all.  But it doesn't even matter as much when you are in an enclosed space like that, worsened by the crowds.  The 30 mns waiting time should have been cut out for safety concerns. If someone feels unwell, they can return.  People should have been let go and allowed to remain in the area or not far away.

My situation:   I am South African and we only have around 200 covid cases a day atm but still we are considered a medium risk zone even though some European countries are at 25 000+ a day and low risk... don't understand that logic. Anyway so we needed to apply for the sandbox setup.  You can imagine how stressed we were about our vaccine certificate QR code not being recognised because South Africa is usually behind on everything or not even thought about before the richer countries so there was very little faith it would go through smoothly.  We uploaded through: - Gmail,  - Used ordinary passport - South African vaccine certificate + separate pic of vaccine QR code. Our vaccine certificate showed our ID numbers but not passport numbers (so I wouldn't worry about editing that in like some people have)  - For accomadation we just used our SHABA certificate which we requested from sha+ hotel and entered the SHABA number provided  into the booking ID part. - AXA insurance certificate showed specifically that covid is covered.   I was honestly the most stressed and strung out I have ever been, I registered a few times on different emails, because I was so scared I had done something wrong. I called my countries Thai embassy who could not help, I tried calling that helpline they provided but noone answered, couldnt sleep or eat.. But my girlfriend remained calm and only made one application without reapplying 50 times like me and at the end of the day we both got the approvals and she got hers 1 hour before me!!  That being said, the best advice I can offer is; STAY CALM. I have not seen many cases of anyone being out right denied yet, we are all rightfully stressing because we are in the first few weeks of the system operating and are essentially guinea pigs! I know it sucks but it had to start somewhere and I truly believe that as long as you made your application with at least 3 full working days to go I am pretty certain they will approve you!   One thing that I noticed did go through is the email to support@tp.consular.go.th they only answered me straight after I had been approved and said that I am already approved - lol-  but it was confirmation that the email line does indeed work!

At BKK you exit the plane, walk a bit and sit in a chair. A attendant checks your documents and pulls the one you need going forward - Covid test, Thai pass qr code, boarding pass, and TM6. Then you carry those documents to the Thai pass checkpoint where they scan the qr and stamp the TM 6. After that, hike to immigration.

My situation:   I am South African and we only have around 200 covid cases a day atm but still we are considered a medium risk zone even though some European countries are at 25 000+ a day and low risk... don't understand that logic. Anyway so we needed to apply for the sandbox setup.  You can imagine how stressed we were about our vaccine certificate QR code not being recognised because South Africa is usually behind on everything or not even thought about before the richer countries so there was very little faith it would go through smoothly.  We uploaded through: - Gmail,  - Used ordinary passport - South African vaccine certificate + separate pic of vaccine QR code. Our vaccine certificate showed our ID numbers but not passport numbers (so I wouldn't worry about editing that in like some people have)  - For accomadation we just used our SHABA certificate which we requested from sha+ hotel and entered the SHABA number provided  into the booking ID part. - AXA insurance certificate showed specifically that covid is covered.   I was honestly the most stressed and strung out I have ever been, I registered a few times on different emails, because I was so scared I had done something wrong. I called my countries Thai embassy who could not help, I tried calling that helpline they provided but noone answered, couldnt sleep or eat.. But my girlfriend remained calm and only made one application without reapplying 50 times like me and at the end of the day we both got the approvals and she got hers 1 hour before me!!  That being said, the best advice I can offer is; STAY CALM. I have not seen many cases of anyone being out right denied yet, we are all rightfully stressing because we are in the first few weeks of the system operating and are essentially guinea pigs! I know it sucks but it had to start somewhere and I truly believe that as long as you made your application with at least 3 full working days to go I am pretty certain they will approve you!   One thing that I noticed did go through is the email to support@tp.consular.go.th they only answered me straight after I had been approved and said that I am already approved - lol-  but it was confirmation that the email line does indeed work! You must just make sure to give your full name, passport number and arrival date at the start if your email.

244,64,0,1633876908,"Can you give an example of 2000% markups in Thailand.  I honestly can’t think of any.    I’m not talking about dual pricing when some street vendor in a tourist part of town tries to scam you.  That kind of stuff goes on everywhere in the world.    I’m talking more about national parks and similar where there is a posted Thai National and Foreigner price displayed.    There, I’ve only seen maybe 100% or 200% maximum.    And that would be off a base price that is ridiculously low to begin with, like 100 baht for Thais and 200 baht for foreigners.     Also, many of those things I mentioned in my previous comment don’t require substantial paperwork.  You picked the most detailed one as an example.  If I go to Disneyland, all I have to show is my CA DL.    A student only needs to show an ID card.  Etc.   I would also add, that “look” is basically laziness.  They don’t ask for every ID because if the person looks Thai and speaks Thai, there’s a good chance they’re Thai.    BTW, it works against them too.  My wife is Thai but holds American citizenship.     When I went to get my vaccination, it was only open to foreigners.  I walked right through and they never even asked for a passport.    She asked, in Thai, if she could get vaccinated too and they told her she couldn’t.    When she told me, I told her to go back and show them her American passport and ask again.    She went back and they gave her a queue number for the vaccine.    They were going to deny her because she looks Thai and speaks Thai.    But, in 99.99% of cases, it’s a correct assumption.  Just like when they didn’t even ask to see my passport.   I could be a naturalized Thai citizen, couldn’t I?     Given the high success rate and the low penalty for being wrong, combined with the added time it would take and longer lines, it’s easier for them to just assume nationality based on appearance.     What’s the harm if one Asian tourist pays the Thai price compared to the long lines that would be involved in checking every ID at the Grand Palace?

Then everyone crams into the elevator up to the 9th floor.  The entire process is indoors in a narrow L shaped corridor.  There were 9 stops.  9. No reason it couldn't have been 2 or 3. Besides the around 150 or so numbers I heard called while i was there, there were dozens of workers (no wonder all these health workers keep testing positive).  Most of them were unnecessary and shouldn't have been there.  There were no accommodations for covid, it was just the usual snap the ""system"" into place and it hopefully fits what you're trying to do.  The number of people up there and the time spent there should have been limited at every chance.  Nothing was cut out and it could have just as easily been a pre-covid event.  And I don't think the spacing between chairs was sufficient at all.  But it doesn't even matter as much when you are in an enclosed space like that, worsened by the crowds.  The 30 mns waiting time should have been cut out for safety concerns. If someone feels unwell, they can return.  People should have been let go and allowed to remain in the area or not far away.  I've never had more than a cup of orange juice and sent away when vaccinated in the past.   Then i get handed a pathetic little piece if paper that says ""Thailand certificate "" for covid vaccine.

Villa was a madhouse just now too, it's ridiculous.",Thailand,t5_2qjw5,/r/Thailand/comments/ob9tve/covid_information_travel_tourism_and_general/h5i5frf/
283,103,1,1626526211,"I have only had my first shot but it wasn't 9 stops. Once up the elevator it was 1 stop to hand the passport, 1 to see them again (this one seemed pointless), one to give them your filled in form and take BP/temperature, then recieve the vaccine then go to observation. The purpose of observation is incase you go into anaphylactic shock I think, it'll probably happen pretty quick after vaccination but you wouldn't want to be far from medical care if it happened I guess.",Thailand,t5_2qjw5,/r/Thailand/comments/ob9tve/covid_information_travel_tourism_and_general/h5iekfm/
284,104,0,1622352158,"Thailand is not a communist country, as a Thai she has the right to use her privilege to fly NYC (first class) and get a vaccine there. As an expat, I will as well use my passport privilege, I am also preparing a trip with my family to get vaccinated in Europe and will not feel ashamed to come back Thailand fully vaccinated. I am enough of the politicians bashing on non-Thai people living in Thailand and theirs politics of « Thai people first » get vaccines. (I know that some expat here already got there vaccines in buriram or phuket but whatever…) If I have the ability to take action and get my family vaccinated ASAP, why not? My following comment may offend and this is not my intention as I am sharing my own opinion. To come back to the topic, from my point of view, Thailand is a narcissist society. -	make donation, take a group picture with the donation. -	go to the temple, take picture praying. -	go donate your blood, take a picture of your arms. -	feeling sick, take a picture on the bed hospital. -	Facebook account with 5000 people that you don’t know -	there is the same trend with restaurant/food but not only Thai people do it :) -	celebrities/idoles showing on theirs YouTube channel, Instagram, Facebook theirs life style and the privilege to get a covid19 test at home or complaining of the lockdown in theirs +300sqm property fully equipped.  In the article, Mint is showing off her life style during covid19 time, I don’t see any difference from my narcissistic list above. Yes people lost there love one during this crisis and I sincerely sympathize, but what is the difference with road accident, cancer etc…",Thailand,t5_2qjw5,/r/Thailand/comments/nnwdk0/opinion_the_good_thing_about_covid19_the_case_of/gzy4cpw/
285,105,0,1620285356,"&gt;I'd be interested to hear from people who are native to Southeast Asia (or  anywhere not in the US) and don't have residency in the US that did  something similiar how it worked.   I get the impression that vaccines are no longer in short supply in the US. That's definitely the case in Texas; I just checked, and the mass vaccination provider near where I live has over 1000 appointments available each day. And pharmacies and supermarkets have plenty of supply too.  I have some Mexican friends who flew to Texas to get vaccinated at a Walmart. No residency required, all the vaccine providers want to see is some photo ID with a birth date (Mexican passport works fine). Unfortunately, their trip was just after the US paused the J&amp;J vaccine, so they got Pfizer instead, and need to make a second trip for the second dose.",Thailand,t5_2qjw5,/r/Thailand/comments/n4obwa/thai_warned_about_vaccine_tourism_to_us/gx4iisd/

Dubai is vaccinating everyone with a government ID, so everyone here on a work permit can get jabbed for free  just like someone with an Emirati passport.  But as I am here on a tourist visa (US passport) I can not get a vaccine for free or by paying. So I will fly back to the US next month.
