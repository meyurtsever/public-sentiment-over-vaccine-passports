The UK is actually an outsider in terms of how quickly we've opened up, how until the very end we managed to avoid vaccine passports, and how we've not gone down the route of vaccine mandates or exclusion of unvaccinated people like is common in large swathes of Europe and the Anglosphere.

20,0,1640727773,"From my understanding a lot of it is to do with tests are managed (I’m no expert, this is just my understanding of the differences in Covid testing strategies between Denmark and the UK, from having followed both countries throughout the pandemic).  In Denmark, in order to get your Covid passport to be allowed in to public places such as restaurants, cinemas etc, you have to have taken a PCR or LFD test at a test centre within 48 hours before, rather than from having done and registered your own LFD test at home (or you have to be fully vaccinated). This clamp down on testing for the virus means that Denmark has, for the most part, a pretty accurate picture of the true prevalence of Covid in the country.  In comparison, in the UK, you can get your Covid passport for entering public places by doing an LFD test at home, without it being verified by a testing facility. This makes it more likely that some tests may be done incorrectly, and also allows people to falsify a negative result. Also, a lot of the people who test positive from at-home LFD tests take isolation requirements in to their own hands and do not then take a follow on PCR test. This means that the test and trace service are not aware of the positive case, and are not able to undertaking tracing of contacts etc. Further to this, testing requirements are generally also less stringent in the UK for entering public places, workplaces etc. These things collectively mean that the NHS test and trace service, as well as the government have a less accurately view of the actual prevalence of Covid in the UK. As such, actual daily positive case numbers are predicted to being far higher than actual reported daily figures.  Worth noting that both Denmark and the UK are amongst the best countries that proactively test for different variants as well, which goes a long way towards understanding what variants are where.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/rqlk9l/covid_live_england_recorded_highest_number_of/hqbv5gi/

Being told by your employer you have to have a medical procedure or you're fired is being compelled. It clearly violates the most basic of human and worker rights. Those being bodily integrity and medical privacy, respectively.  &gt;How the F does that have any relevance or bearing on anything?!?  Ask the tens of thousands of NHS staff unhappy with being compelled to have COVID vaccines. It's a lot easier to exploit a minority of people than it is a majority.   &gt;Why the hell should everyone be forced to expose their elderly relatives to some ignorant anti-vax moron who puts their lives at risk, when there's no need?  Correct, there is no need. Daily testing already happens. Which, as COVID passport advocates have already acknowledged, offers the same protection as a vaccine mandate. That's why they give the choice of proof of vaccine or a negative test result (a far less recent one).  Your fear doesn't give you the right to mandate medical procedures for other people. I don't know how else to put it. Particularly when the people demanding this aren't doing the most basic things to protect themselves from COVID. If you're this afraid of COVID, I can recommend a dozen things you can do to mitigate your risk. But you'll do none of them because you're a raging hypocrite who wants to stamp on other peoples' rights to protect you from your own irresponsibility.   &gt;Yes. Really. Go ask a lawyer.

34,0,1639566489,"&gt;Why against covid certification?  I'm against them first and foremostly because they have been proven, by [studies](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/229153/vaccine-passports-linked-covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy/), to *increase* vaccine hesitancy.   COVID-19 vaccines have little (and decreasing) ability to protect against transmission of the virus, but they are able to prevent severe disease and even death. It's extremely important that people get vaccinated, but COVID passports entrench the unvaccinated and may even turn people against getting their boosters. They create a sense that vaccines are being used to control people rather than help them. And even worse - the conduit for the backlash caused by that perception is usually the National Health Service. That, to my mind, is more dangerous than just letting an unvaccinated person into an establishment to spread the virus - something that, whether they're vaccinated or not, would be happening anyway.  [The Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Select Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Administration_and_Constitutional_Affairs_Select_Committee) also published [a report](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/327/public-administration-and-constitutional-affairs-committee/news/157355/covid-passport-policy-lacks-scientific-evidence-base/) in September 2021 noting that COVID passport policies ack a scientific evidence base. And since then, real world application in similar countries to England like Wales, Scotland, and France have shown that they have little to no effect on viral spread. France has possibly the strictest COVID passport policy in the world and yet they have similar daily case numbers to the UK right now and are in the midst of their second biggest wave - England is in the same position, and we have not had COVID passports until now.  On a personal note: my mum's family are Irish Catholics from Northern Ireland. I have an extreme aversion to segregation. Barring the unvaccinated from participating in society, [especially when so many of them are of an ethnic minority makeup](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(21)00157-5/fulltext), is a bit dodgy to me.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/rgn50a/jeremy_corbyn_votes_against_compulsory_jab_for/homqp79/
35,1,1639572475,"Im not sure we’re on the same page, I’m not arguing that the government shouldn’t know these things (not that I think they should but as you say, that horse has bolted). I’m saying on this particular issue I.e. you must undergo this medical procedure or your individual freedom to go the cinema, go to concerts, go to football games etc is revoked, is unjust. As we have said, the unvaccinated pose little to no more of a risk than the vaccinated in terms of transmission, so on what grounds do the government have the right to control people in this way?   It’s easy to compare it to needing a driving license to drive, for example, as many have, but it is very clear why someone without a driving license poses a danger to other road users or pedestrians; they either haven’t been or couldn’t be trained to a suitable standard, or they have previously driven to such a poor and unsafe degree that their license has been revoked. It is pretty black and white. Even then, all the government is saying is “You require a license to do X, otherwise you can’t do X”. Covid passports straight away rest on far more unsteady ground in terms of their justification.

40,1,1639507254,"As per a report that the cross-party parliamentary Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee published in September...  &gt;Covid passports are being introduced for entry to some venues, including nightclubs and live sporting events, to control the spread of the virus according to the Government. However, new analysis and a lack of evidence provided by the Government in its response to the Committee’s report casts doubt on whether this will work.   &gt;   &gt;\[...\] the latest analysis by Public Health England (PHE) found that although being fully vaccinated protects against infection and severe symptoms, it unlikely to do much to stop the spread of the virus if people become infected. Jabbed and unjabbed individuals carry similar amounts of the virus.   &gt;   &gt;Concerns over viral load of the Delta variant appeared in Sage meeting minutes from 22 July. Sage, the Government’s scientific advisory panel, warned that there is ‘limited vaccine effect against onward transmission’ of the variant. Given that this meeting was held before the Government responded to the Committee’s report, the Committee has severe concerns about the way in which this policy has been developed and kept under consideration.  “We have often heard throughout the pandemic that the Government will follow the science, but when afforded the opportunity to provide it on Covid passports, it has failed to do so. All we have is a flimsy claim that there is a public health case, but without any foundation for the claim to stand on.”  “With recent analysis suggesting that vaccinated people carry as much of the virus as the unvaccinated into any setting, the disappointing lack of any scientific basis for the Government’s decision to go ahead could reasonably lead people to conclude that there is in fact no such basis. If the real goal is to drive vaccine uptake, then it is a deeply cynical approach that will be counterproductive.”  “Following through on such a costly, discriminatory and, potentially, ineffective policy will have consequences for trust in and acceptance of the Government’s measures to tackle the pandemic. It’s surely either time to prove how this’ll work or to put an end to it.”  Or let's just take a look at France, who have a similarly sized population as the UK *and* an incredibly strict COVID passport programme, and currently have a 7 day case average of +48,000 - not dissimilar to the UK's +51,000 7 day case average.  They do not fucking work, and the Wikipedia article you linked is talking about quarantine certificates, not COVID passports.  &gt;the public health measures being mandated are neither oppressive nor authoritarian  I'm sure the people present at Sarah Everard's wake, the Kill The Bill protestors who got their faces fucking smashed in with riot shields because they were 'violating COVID-19 restrictions', the university students who had the police pin them into their accommodation blocks, etc. would agree with you.  You can harp on about how I'm on the wrong side of history if you want. We'll see what happens when the unvaccinated, who already map directly onto a map of people who hate authority, get to position medical agencies as an 'other' to fight because they're being threatened with social exclusion to get vaccines they don't trust, by a government they don't trust and don't believe are acting in their best interests, every six months.  &gt;Facts.   &gt;   &gt;Don't.   &gt;   &gt;Care.   &gt;   &gt;About.   &gt;   &gt;Your.   &gt;   &gt;Feelings.

Uh... look i think that guy is a prat, and I agree that the measures being proposed are good and necessary (and not going far enough: a lockdown would probably bankrupt me and is probably necessary) however there is a legitimate fear that these measures, created in a time of national emergency, might get extended or simply not leave at the end.

110,0,1632468179,"#BBC’s lack of Tory scrutiny is ‘failing’ viewers, research finds   *Laura Webster*  ---   THE BBC has been accused of “failing to deliver” on its editorial guidelines after it emerged that its flagship News at Six did not run a single negative news story about the UK Government last week.  From September 13-17 no stories on the UK-wide news programme featured negative framing of the Westminster Government, research by The National found.  During the same period, Reporting Scotland ran 10 stories about the Scottish Government with a negative framing.  The disparity was identified as political stories on both the News at Six and Reporting Scotland were recorded each evening and categorised based on whether they featured a positive, negative or neutral framing of each government. Negative framing typically includes someone being “accused” of something or forced to “defend” an action.   The News at Six mainly featured stories that were neutral towards the UK Government, with 17 of the total 24 political stories using this framing. There was also one positively framed story about the UK Government, one neutral package about the Scottish Government and one negatively framed segment on Holyrood.  Meanwhile Reporting Scotland featured just six neutrally framed stories about the SNP government, compared to 10 negative ones. Every UK Government story was framed in a neutral light, and there was just one positive Scottish Government piece.  It is the third time this year The National has carried out the research, and the third time Reporting Scotland has been noticeably more critical of Holyrood than the News at Six has been of Westminster.  Rona Mackay (below), SNP MSP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, criticised the BBC over the findings.  “The BBC is mandated to ‘due impartiality in all its output’ – but they are failing to deliver on their own editorial guidelines,” she told The National.  “It is hard to believe Reporting Scotland and its sensationalist reporting are from the same organisation as the too-often acquiescent BBC News at Six.  “BBC bosses needs to explain to audiences the gross disparity in their editorial treatment between north and south of the Border.”  Most stories with a negative framing of the Scottish Government focused on health last week, with stories covering high ambulance response times, increased Covid-19 deaths, hospitality groups’ criticism of vaccine passport plans and a technical issue preventing full reporting of daily coronavirus figures.  Health stories on the News at Six, however, were presented to viewers through a neutral lens despite touching on similar themes of Covid-19 and planning to see the NHS through a difficult winter.  The 17 neutral stories also included coverage of the Westminster debate on cutting Universal Credit, a move which could push 800,000 people into poverty, according to research from the Legatum Institute think tank.  A spokesperson for the BBC said: “Journalists across the BBC always strive for fairness, accuracy and impartiality in their reporting of news stories for our audiences across all our platforms.”  The new research has been revealed after the Scottish Government hit back at Scottish Tory claims that ministers had put up a “wall of silence” over problems facing the NHS and ambulance service.  At the weekend, BBC Scotland interviewed Tory MSP and GP Sandesh Gulhane – with presenter Martin Geissler saying Humza Yousaf and Jason Leitch had refused to appear on the Sunday Show.  A spokesperson for the Holyrood Government said the Conservatives’ claims were “false”.  “Government and ministers have been working around the clock and will continue doing so to keep the public informed and to support the NHS through the exceptional and unique pressures it is facing due to the global pandemic,” they said.  “Ministers and clinicians have spoken to the media almost every day last week – the Health Secretary was interviewed on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and today [Sunday], the First Minister addressed Parliament on Thursday and the national clinical director was interviewed on Thursday and Friday.”",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/puepr3/bbcs_lack_of_tory_scrutiny_is_failing_viewers/he2cp4g/

113,2,1631898798,"You don't seem to be getting the point. The passport is not made to prevent vaccinated people to get covid. It is made to prevent unvaccinated people from accessing large venues with other loads of people who can easily give them covid. Testing is an imperfect choice to accommodate those who can't get vaxxed, but at least you would know that anybody in a nightclub/large event is either vaccinated (1/2 to 1/5 of transmission probability wrt to unvaccinated, so lower probability of having covid overall) or tested negative. This would reduce spread to unvaccinated people and create more incentives to get vaccinated.  In turn, this would reduce the hospital burden. Which is the main and only point of the initiative.   Your considerations on the current passport make no sense, as it is not in widespread use. Also, the domestic pass does not show why you have it. It just shows you are ""ok"". So you are not sharing personal data (if you are vaccinated or not). You clearly don't know how they work.  The only legitimate reason against this initiative is ""I don't want a sort-of ID thing"". Let's not consider that you already have to present it to enter nightclubs, but it is legitimate. I would not agree, but it is legitimate. There is no logical reason, if you are open to IDs, to be against covid passports.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ppyd78/bbc_news_covid_vaccine_and_test_passes_to_be/hd89ja8/
114,3,1631902187,"&gt;It doesn’t create an incentive, it effectively mandates it if you need one to do anything to be involved with society  No, it doesn't. You can still test or avoid going to places. A mandate means that if you are not vaccinated, you get fined heavily if you don't vaccinate your children your parental rule can be overridden by public health officials, and so on.  For example, passports are not mandatory. However, if you don't have one you can't go to places. Blood tests are not mandatory, nor are condoms, but if you don't test and you have unprotected sex you can't donate blood. And so on. Vaccination won't be mandatory, but if you don't get vaccinated nor want to test with the free LFTs... well, you won't be able to go to places. Easy.  &gt;Like I’ve said, why do you need a passport if the majority of the population is vaccinated?  The ""majority"" of the population is vaccinated also in the US. However, you can see how several states are saturating their hospitals despite it being summer (so people spending more time outdoor). Is the 89% in the UK enough to prevent hospitals from getting full? In case of a strong wave, even without a new variation probably not. Full hospitals mean postponing other types of healthcare, putting other hospital patients at risk etc...  &gt;I work with complex data on a daily basis  Me too. So you should know that one of the things that can make such a system acceptable is a simple rule of not storing the data and not showing the reason of your pass. People will know you have the passport, but not why. It could be due to testing or vaccination. Or exemption. Or whatever other reason. You won't be able to tell novaxxers from vaxxed people, exempt from vaxxed, and exempt from novaxxers. The only thing you will get to know is that that person is either vaccinated or does not have covid, and thus is allowed to enter a venue (if they had covid and knew it, they should be barred anyway as by law).  &gt;The point you are missing is if this allowed to happen en-masse and becomes the norm, they will be able to mandate anything. Personal freedom and choice is something we should never ever ever take for granted because once it’s gone, it’s seriously fucking hard to get back.  Again, this is a legitimate argument. I may agree for the UK more than for other countries (due to the common law system and lack of a proper Constitution), but the other arguments do not make any sense. I have told you what is the point of passports (avoid clogging up hospitals), that they already exist and are based on a fully functional system (no need to spend money, just open your NHS app and you'll find your pass), and that this does not reveal any information regarding your health record (you have clearly never opened your NHS domestic covid pass, have't you?), nor your ""checks"" get stored.  Even the legitimate concern that mandatory vaccines may reduce uptake may be true under certain circumstances, but not in general. For example, a mandatory covid vaccine may reduce public confidence in the institutions for the future, but I would expect the covid vaccination rate to go up, and fast. It happened in France and Italy. Again, Italy recently had to introduce harsh vaccine mandates and strengthen their enforcement as a lot of people just stopped vaccinating their children against deadly diseases due to fake news and social media resonance chambers, with vaccination rates for some of the ""normal"" vaccines dropping to 85-90%. After the mandate was introduced a few years ago, vaccination rates are up a gain to close to 100%.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ppyd78/bbc_news_covid_vaccine_and_test_passes_to_be/hd8hmos/
115,4,1631905772,"Currently, I agree with you on the mandated, it isn’t. However, my concern is that it isn’t financial consequences, it’s the discrimination and societal pressures that have consequences on people. Purely anecdotal, but my brother has PTSD and for that reason couldn’t wear a mask, it triggered him and he was regularly met with abuse because he wasn’t wearing a mask in a public setting. It’s these people I’m trying to defend and introducing measures like vaccine passports has wide reaching consequences that I just don’t think you are willing to even entertain or admit they are real.  I could probably align with you if the vaccine stopped all transmission and was a silver bullet to stop covid altogether - but it isn’t. We are told almost every winter the NHS is due to collapse due to the flu (again, I’m not an idiot, covid is more serious than the flu, but the main point stands, we don’t require a passport for other transmissible diseases which supposedly bring the NHS to its knees every winter) so why would give up liberties for this? Why would we prevent people from being active members of a society? If someone is clinically unable to have a vaccine, no amount of testing or passports is going to protect them, thus making the entire idea useless, the only use would be handing over control to the government for artificial purposes.  Travel passports are completely different. I do not need one domestically to enter a pub or a venue, unless it’s being used for ID purposes in place of a driving license or any other officially recognised ID, which is a completely different context to the one in which you referred to.  Abstracting data away or down to a yes or no or other simplified context does not decrease the sensitivity of the data when used in a personal context, that’s why we have things like password fields on login forms, the data is abstracted from view, but is still sensitive. Vaccination data or health data in general is sensitive, which is why we have super strict laws to keep it that way. The idea of having a passport doesn’t work in practise also. Who decides the validity of the passport? What system does it get checked against? A centralised government database? Government systems are generally shite and outdated and couldn’t cope with a nationalised rollout on such scale and demand. What would the infrastructure look like to enable this? Every single enclosed space in the country would need some kind of validation system to make sure it was all correct or the effectiveness of the passport system is essentially non-existent. It’s all good showing a phone screen or piece of paper but can it actually be verified? In this case the data you refer to has absolutely no integrity, therefore making it absolutely useless to do anything with. I have opened the app tbh, it’d be incredibly easy to take a screenshot and doctor it, hence the need for validation infrastructure, which I wouldn’t trust our government to implement in a month of Sunday’s given how poorly designed and poorly engineered the test and trace app was.  The whole point of the vaccine is to stop clogging up hospitals, if a tiny proportion of the population (I think your over exaggerating how many people are genuine anti-vaxxers) don’t get vaccinated it will be negligible on terms of the overall outcome, especially considering that people who have the vaccine can also still be hospitalised, again the vaccine does not eliminate covid.  The UK government are renowned for the “surveillance state”, this is no untruth. If you work with data like you say, you will understand how much the government are hell bent in knowing where we are, who we’re with and so on. This concern that “giving an inch and they will take a mile” is not unfounded, if we let me mandate things like this, it’ll be a hell of a lot easier to mandate more intrusive things in the future. I can almost say with certainty that most of the powers granted to the government in the COVID Act as temporary measures will remain in law.  So better education and combating fake news seems like a better alternative to increase uptake in any vaccine, as most experts do agree.   A vaccine passport is not necessary at all, if people are vaccinated, which the majority are, the risk in the NHS collapsing is reduced by an order of magnitude. It’s widely impractical in my opinion and I’m a strong advocate for peoples privacy, personal data, personal responsibility and personal choice. I also don’t believe everyone who opts out of having the vaccine is a raging lunatic that succumbed to fake news, it’s just simply their choice and they shouldn’t be excluded from society, they should still have the same rights as anyone else.  I don’t think we’ll agree and that is completely fine, we don’t have to agree that’s beauty of personal freedom!

180,3,1630264963,"&gt;The data simply does not support this belief.   Yep, vaccine acceptance is pretty high, but there's nothing wrong with aiming to have higher acceptance than 88%. Every extra person who uses the relatively small resources to get vaccinated reduces strain on our health system. And since you like anecdotes so much, I suggest you look at some of the comments from medical professionals on here about their feelings on this. Or here's a wider survey if you don't want to listen to random people on the internet https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/226513/many-icu-staff-have-experienced-mental/  &gt; but it would be far cheaper and easier to offer a £100 payment to each fully vaccinated young adult   Yeah, I'm not against that idea. Sounds fine to me. But I see no issue with having it alongside vaccine passports.  &gt;**3) Vaccine passports ignore natural immunity due to prior infection**  &gt;There is now a good body of evidence showing that recovery from prior infection offers strong protection against re-infection. Freaking out about 34% of young adults being unvaccinated ignores the fact that a substantial portion of them will already have protection (90% of 30-year-olds were found to already have antibodies against Covid). If there truly is a concern about unvaccinated young people,   &gt; surely the problem will solve itself quickly as they get infected by and recover from Covid.   People don't just 'recover from covid'. They put an entirely unnecessary burden on our healthcare system. It seems you have very little empathy for the people working hard to save idiots who don't give a damn about others.  &gt;  by now everyone choosing to remain unvaccinated is willingly taking that risk.  There are plenty of people who are simply apathetic to it. The portion of diehard antivaxxers is quite small.   https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1138  Plenty of people are open to putting in the effort to get one.  &gt;The argument that the unvaccinated pose a threat to the vaccinated does not stack up. While vaccines offer strong protection against serious illness or death from Covid, the most recent data emerging from highly vaccinated countries (such as Israel or Gibraltar) shows that vaccines are less effective at preventing infection.  Which studies are you referring to? Because from what I can see, the evidence is quite clear that vaccines reduce the spread of infection  https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n338  &gt;Once pubs and other venues are forced to implement a mechanism for checking everyone’s vaccine passports on entry,  Who said pubs should be forced to do this? I've never argued that.  &gt; it will become trivially easy to expand the system to advance other social objectives, and transform Britain into a “papers, please” society.   Well, I agree that pubs shouldn't be forced to do this, but I don't think it would be any worse than requiring pubs to stop smoking indoors, or telling people to wear seatbelts in their own car. What a lot of people don't seem to understand is that we have a social healthcare system. It costs people resources to look after others who harm themselves unnecessarily.  &gt; What about banning criminals and other social undesirables? Once it’s normal for pubs, why not roll it out to all public venues?  That's nonsense. The point of our justice system is rehabilitation. Criminals are not 'social undesirables', assuming that our justice system is working remotely well.  &gt; Not because I'm against flu jabs, but because I have never needed one.   Getting a flu jab isn't just for you. You seem to be one of those people who doesn't really grasp that vaccines are not just for the person receiving them. Some nice info from the CDC here:  https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/misconceptions.htm  &gt;The sad thing is that you *talk* like a government official even though you aren't one.   Indeed I am not. I am quite critical of this government and think it's one of the worst the UK has seen in a century. My stance on this issue is the same regardless of what the government holds as a stance.

183,0,1630004729,"&gt; However, I feel that those who want them should be the ones to convince everyone else why they are a good idea, why they would benefit everyone.  Simply put, if a vaccine means that someone has less chance of transmitting a potentially fatal virus, it is of interest to people whether someone they are in contact with is vaccinated. Vaccine passports are merely official documentation for that.  You seem to be persisting with the strawman that somehow vaccine passports do not account for people who cannot receive a vaccine, yet of course, they do. The few situations where they have been rolled out recently also account for people who haven't had the vaccine, but have actually been ill with the virus.  &gt; at the moment the majority of people who will have a vaccine have probably already had one by now.  Some people take more convincing than others. This is quite natural, and we shouldn't give up at the first sign of difficulty.  &gt; The people who you now have to convince are those conspiracy theorists and those who are reluctant to for whatever reason.  Fortunately not. There are still plenty of people who are simply uninformed or apathetic, I know some of them in person.  &gt; Punishing them into getting a vaccine, by restricting their freedoms   You're back on the strawman arguments - where did anyone say a vaccine passport is restricting freedoms? If you mean that certain situations will limit access based upon vaccination status, isn't that entirely reasonable? For example, working at a care home? It's entirely standard to limit access to certain elements of society well before covid was a thing. You need a pilots license to fly a plane for example, but are you complaining that other people's freedoms have been restricted? Some people would certainly make that argument, but I dare say it's a pretty bad one.   The reason we don't let just anyone fly planes is that it can cause damage to other people - it's the same with someone wanting to be unvaccinated. They're perfectly entitled to remain unvaccinated, but they won't have access to situations where they can harm others through their decision.  I suppose you will also argue that it's unreasonable to have laws restricting guns and knives in the UK? This is very much an argument in some countries. Fortunately, the 'muh freedoms' argument doesn't tend to go very far in the UK, perhaps because we are simply a lot more cramped together.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/pa12mw/antivaxx_protesters_force_their_way_into_itns/hagkxbi/

No one would be saying they dont want the government telling them what they put in their bodies if it was guaranteed that they wouldnt get covid?  They've been protesting 5g microchips in vaccines, would that no longer matter if the vaccine was 100% immunity? It doesnt add up. It is not a sound argument on that basis alone.  And all this fuss over a document surely cannot be about the small chance you can get ill after being vaccinated.   You're saying that's it's a bingo that the argument is over compliance, when again we do that without thinking all through our lives. I just had to comply with the voting register in my town. Why be so exhorcised over this one document if not for selfish reasons, and literally no other required documents? Why not protest driving licenses if it's only about agreeing to do what the government wants?  You have a personal choice to get a driving license or not, you can even still drive without one. you just cant legally drive without one.   Again there is no logic, no good reason beyond selfishness.   It comes down to a simple question.

I'm wide aware. I'm enlightened... Just because I refuse to be a slave, you accuse me of being a lunatic.""   &gt;   &gt;He added that he had spent ""hundreds of hours"" studying the law and said that he knew legal matters better than DPP Koh.   &gt;   &gt;Stressing that he had been ""kidnapped and abducted"" against his will, Glynn also said that he had been ""tortured physically and psychologically"".   &gt;   &gt;He also urged the court to drop the case and return him his passport so that he could return to his family in Britain.   &gt;   &gt;After hearing both sides, Judge Tham said that there is reason to suspect Glynn could be of unsound mind.   &gt;   &gt;He ordered the Briton to be remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for psychiatric observation. The trial will resume on Aug 19.   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;Unhappy with the decision, Glynn lashed out at the court and exclaimed: ""I'm disgusted with how the Singapore judicial system has treated me.""   &gt;   &gt;A woman who was seated in the gallery clapped when she heard this, prompting the judge to remind her to practise decorum in court.   &gt;   &gt;Before he was led away, Glynn exclaimed: ""Good luck getting into the book of life, Mr Koh...

192,1,1628136269,"&gt; **Man seen without mask on train remanded at IMH after rant during first day of trial**  &gt; SINGAPORE: A man who was seen without a mask on a train was ordered by a judge on Thursday (Aug 5) to be remanded at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) after ranting in court.  &gt; The prosecution also pointed out that British national Benjamin Glynn's family and friends had written to them reporting a ""marked change of behaviour"" in Glynn that was noticeable especially after COVID-19 restrictions set in.  &gt; Glynn, 40, faces four charges for failing to wear a mask without reasonable excuse, public nuisance and using threatening words towards a public servant.  &gt; Throughout the hearing, Glynn repeated that he was a sovereign, living man against whom the charges had no effect. He called the proceedings ""preposterous"" and ""disgusting"".  &gt; His supporters filled the courtroom, with one woman repeatedly laughing and another clapping loudly when Glynn slammed Singapore's judiciary. Court officers stepped in to stop them at various points.  &gt; Thursday was meant to be Glynn's first day of trial, but he insisted he would not be pleading guilty or not guilty as it was ""nonsense"".  &gt; The hearing opened with Glynn trying to introduce his legal counsel, a Mr Abdul Rashid Abdul Rahman. He had appeared in court with Glynn previously, but was stopped at the door for improper attire.  &gt; Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh told the court that the prosecution had performed their checks and confirmed that Mr Abdul Rashid was not an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore.  &gt; Mr Abdul Rashid said he is not, but that he is an ""ambassador at large and advocate of Kingdom Filipina Hacienda"", and that he was there to defend his ""sovereign compatriot"".  &gt; He said he understood the meaning of the bar, but said ""I don't need a licence to practice"".  &gt; Mr Koh told the court that the prosecution would be making an application for Glynn to be assessed at IMH, to see if he is of unsound mind.  &gt; **FAMILY AND FRIENDS SENT LETTER ON GLYNN'S BEHAVIOUR**  &gt; ""Prosecution has received a letter from the accused's family and friends or persons purporting to be his family and friends and in this letter, the persons report a marked change of behaviour in the accused's person that was noticeable especially after the COVID restrictions set in,"" he said.  &gt; Given this new information, as well as Glynn's behaviour in court and previous hearings and his choice of counsel, the prosecution said it would be ""prudent"" to assess Glynn to ensure he is of sound mind and capable of making his defence.  &gt; Glynn interrupted at multiple points. He told District Judge Eddy Tham: ""I assure you my mind is very sound. Every time I ask you hard questions, you can't answer me, you shoot me down. What law have I broken? I asked you three times the last time, you gave me silence, silence, silence.""  &gt; He added that he was ""wide awake"", ""enlightened"" and researched ""everything"" but believes nothing.  &gt; When Mr Koh added that Glynn's family members have reported his ""increasing hostility"" towards them, Glynn interjected: ""The certificate of vaccine regulations do not apply to the living man and I'm well aware of this fact.""  &gt; ""Why have the mask regulations been dropped all over American and Europe? Because they are unconstitutional. I don't get my information from the Straits Times.""  &gt; He asked if the prosecutor had seen his ""sovereign ID"", adding that he felt like ""a PhD law lecturer dealing with a GCE law student"".  &gt; He claimed that the police ""kidnapped and abducted"" him on his daughter's birthday, arresting him a second time at his hotel.  &gt; ""I hid in the bathroom and I said - I do not consent, I do not comply. They dragged me out of the shower and handcuffed me. I asked them what crime am I accused of committing. Silence,"" Glynn continued.  &gt; He claimed he spent 18 days ""being tortured in Changi Prison"".  &gt; ""What kind of justice is this, this is preposterous, and the torts against either living man that have been done against me include two unlawful arrests, two false imprisonments, two trespasses against me. They've stolen my passport, my God-given right to travel,"" he said.  &gt; He added that he understood the law ""better than anyone you've ever dealt with before"" and demanded to be released and sent back to England with his family, ""and let's not have a big fuss and scene over this"".  &gt; He continued that his defence is ""very solid and water-tight"" and that the prosecutor ""has no control over my legal fiction"".  &gt; ""I will never plead guilty or not guilty. I can't believe this has been going on since the 8th of May,"" Glynn said.  &gt; ""It's so straightforward it's so clear that this sham of a case should be dropped.""  &gt; A woman in the public gallery burst out laughing soon after this, and another woman waved two thumbs up at Glynn.  &gt; Judge Tham ordered Glynn to be remanded at IMH for two weeks and return to court on Aug 19.  &gt; At this, Glynn raised his voice, saying this is ""absolutely outrageous injustice"".  &gt; ""I am disgusted. How can you send an innocent man to prison when he has not been found guilty and the charges do not apply to him ... I am disgusted at how the Singapore judicial system has treated me and my family,"" he said.  &gt; The woman who had raised her thumbs at Glynn clapped very loudly at this point, and the judge reminded her to observe court decorum.  &gt; As proceedings wound down, Glynn called to the prosecutor: ""Good luck getting into the book of life, Mr Koh. Good luck with that one. How can you say Singapore is a safe country. Police who hunt me down like a pack of wild animals. This is not justice. This is disgusting. I am appalled.""  &gt; He added that he would be ""seeking lawful remedy"".  &gt; Glynn will be taken back to court in two weeks.

The IFR and symptomatic presentation of covid drops hugely amongst the vaccinated (IFR will be sub-0.5%) so the risk of anyone catching serious disease from me is miniscule.  So what are the benefits of vaccine passports amongst a largely vaccinated population? How do they outweigh the economic and social downsides of excluding 5-10% of the population from society? What is cost benefit? The government has a track record of screwing things up, this will be no difference. All for a virus with an IFR of sub-0.5%.  The true reasons for bringing in a vaccine passport would be authoritarian and sinister, they are in no way justified in terms of the virus. That said, I'm hoping that they are just a threat to increase uptake.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oqkio1/covid19_govt_reserves_right_to_make_vaccine/h6gfwpy/

204,2,1627238514,"&gt;Is the vaccine working exactly as anticipated? There are fairly hefty side effects, one of the reasons other mRNA experiments have never got past primary testing. I won't muddy the waters with anecdotal evidence as we both know it's not really admissable in this sort of discussion, but recorded side effects are, and they are not to be ignored (pleurisy, myocarditis, etc etc).  Now I can see you're arguing in bad faith, because the side effect profile of hese vaccines is extremely low. Far lower than the vast, vast majority of medicines out there. People get irrationally hung up on vaccine side effects.  &gt;As I say, I'm far from an anti-vaxxer, I'm a veritable pin cushion from growing up in the West and then travelling around the world. In fact, I may be rare in this discussion in that I already have a vaccine passport: for yellow fever, a disease with a death rate of between 15 and 50%. Even the lowest end of that is 5x more deadly than the most extreme (3-4%, age adjusted, CDC) estimates of covid. And even then you don't show it in fucking shops, if anywhere you show it at the border.  The deadliness of a disease is NOT the only factor. The rate of spread is very important. Long term post viral syndromes are very important. Covid spreads much more rapidly than yellow fever. Comparing them is absolutely absurd.   Countries with yellow fever likely have rather high vaccine uptake rates as well.  &gt;I know living in a society requires you to surrender freedoms for the sake of other people in the society. So why is the speed limit on roads not a blanket 10 mph? I bet that would reduce car accident fatalities to essentially zero. Because there has to be some kind of compromise and I don't think that the risk of covid justifies the government overreach in this case.  Absurd comparison. Not nearly enough people are injured/dying on the roads to overburden the ambulance services, or fill hospitals to dangerously high occupancy levels. Traffic injuries are not contagious, either. You are using nonsensical arguments to justify your position. Reality is less convenient.

Ideally we'd have such measures in place already. But a good faith interpretation of freedom day is to show what happens when you allow everybody complete freedom at the moment. That cases get out of hand. I have a feeling in a months time when this passport date comes along that the numbers of cases might make it look like a more reasonable course of action. Who knows, maybe the vaccine is a wonder drug and after an initial spike it'll wear itself out and passports will be unnecessary. But I have a feeling reasonable people will be happy to give up a little freedom to improve contact tracing if that means avoiding going in to a lockdown.

275,0,1624259645,"The Port of Dover is taking legal action to overturn an “irrational” government decision not to fund a £33.5m project to build more passport check points which it says are needed to cope with post-Brexit immigration controls.  The UK channel port, which handles more EU lorry freight than all other UK ports combined, has won the right to seek a judicial review of a Cabinet Office [decision last December](https://archive.is/aMLjK) not to grant funds for the project that would have doubled passport checking capacity.  Dover applied last September for a grant from the £200m Port Infrastructure Fund but was rejected after the fund attracted applications worth more than £450m.  Seeking leave to have the decision overturned in the courts, Dover’s lawyers said the government had “acted irrationally” and “contrary to the published criteria” of the Port Infrastructure Fund, as well behaving “procedurally unfairly”.  UK government lawyers asked the court to refuse Dover’s application, arguing that the government had “wide discretion” in deciding which applications to accept and that Dover’s application did not meet the full requirements of the fund’s rubric.   However, a High Court judge ruled Dover raised issues that were “clearly arguable” in court and granted permission for the case to be heard. Dover is seeking that the government’s original decision is quashed and their application reconsidered.  The case raises the prospect of significant disruptions to cross-Channel travel and trade when passenger numbers rise following the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. The French border police informed the port that passengers and lorry drivers will face “100 per cent immigration checks” after Brexit.  As a result of leaving the EU, British passport holders can now only spend 90 days in any 180 day period in the EU without obtaining a visa, requiring passports to receive a dated entry stamp, increasing the time needed for checks.  In its submission to the court, Dover said the UK Border Force had warned the new checks could reduce the “flow rate” through Dover’s passport lanes to “50 people per hour, per lane” — about a tenth of pre-Brexit flows of 500 per hour, per lane.  Dover currently has just five passport lanes and on a busy holiday weekend can expect up to 20,000 passenger vehicles in a day.  Under special arrangements known as “juxtaposed controls” designed to speed travel over the Channel crossing, French border and immigration checks are conducted at Dover so that passengers can disembark without stopping when they reach Calais.   A National Audit Office report [last November](https://archive.is/ERViF) estimated that new post-Brexit checks could mean passenger queues of one to two hours after January 1, but warned that in peak periods “the queues and delays could become much longer”.   Travel restrictions imposed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic have meant that the NAO’s estimates have not been tested. The lack of passenger vehicles has also helped keep freight traffic moving, with lorries currently using four of the five available lanes — compared to just one lane before Brexit.  Tim Reardon, the head of EU exit planning at Dover, said French frontier police had requested the extra booths and the UK government, according to the agreement on ‘juxtaposed controls’, was obliged to provide them.  “This project is essential to maintain the flow of freight and passenger traffic now full immigration controls are required post-Brexit. As host to the French police, the UK government has a legal obligation to provide the resources they require,” he said.  Downing Street said it would not comment on a legal proceeding, but added that the government was “robustly” contesting the claim from Port of Dover.       *Peter Foster in Brighton* June 20, 2021   *Additional reporting Jane Croft*",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/o4ph5u/dover_takes_legal_action_against_government_over/h2iihuv/

297,2,1618768177,"When it comes to Europe’s Covid vaccination rollout, could it be that slow and steady wins the race?  After a lacklustre start to delivering doses around the continent, that is certainly the message European leaders are now sending.  Following a debut marred by delays and a dearth of supplies, the EU’s vaccination drive is finally gathering pace, leading some even to suggest - chief among them President Emmanuel Macron himself - that it could catch up with Britain “in the coming weeks”.  “With all the shots rolling in, it’s even no longer unthinkable that the EU will finish vaccinating its entire adult population ahead of the UK,” claimed Joshua Livestro, member of the Committee on European Integration of the Advisory Council on International Affairs of the Dutch Foreign Ministry.  ""While the UK is likely to finish its vaccination marathon crawling on all fours, the EU will be sprinting toward the tape.”  As the UK reopens, such claims appear wildly exaggerated. Indeed, with the continent still in the grip of a deadly third wave and fresh health concerns over the new Johnson&amp;Johnson jab as well as new variants, the EU is struggling to make headway against the pandemic.  Yet undoubtedly there are encouraging indicators.   European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced this week that the EU administered 100m doses, “a milestone we can be proud of!”. More than a quarter are second shots, meaning more than 27m Europeans are fully vaccinated.  “We are also accelerating the delivery of vaccinations,” she insisted.  The EC chief has set a target of inoculating 75 per cent of the adult population by the end of summer.  EU leaders have also declared that the bloc will soon become the world’s number one producer of vaccines.  With the EU’s nose still out of joint over AstraZeneca delays and its run-in with the UK, Mrs von der Leyen confirmed the bloc would receive 250m doses of Pfizer in the second quarter - some 50m more than expected. Negotiations have begun for a contract of 1.8bn doses over 2021-2023 with all production and raw materials being based on the continent.  Some countries are bounding ahead with jabs. In the Netherlands, the number of daily doses per 100 people shot above the UK rate of 0.64 to reach 0.77 on April 11. With 4m doses administered, the country has now given 21.6 per cent of the adult population a first dose, with 6.1 per cent of the population fully vaccinated.  Lampooned for its early vaccination efforts, France has passed some positive milestones of late.  It is consistently hitting more than 450,000 vaccinations a day after opening the first of 40 mass vaccine centres across the country last week, including at the stade de France, the national stadium. On Friday, it surpassed 12 million first doses - two million higher than its mid-April target - and is easily on track to reach 20 million by mid-May and 30 million the following month.  Ursula von der Leyen received her vaccine a day after the EU passed 100m jabs Ursula von der Leyen received her vaccine a day after the EU passed 100m jabs Some 17.8 per cent of the French population, (and 22.8 per cent of adults), had received one jab with more than six per cent having received two. That is still way behind the UK, which has surpassed 32 million first doses (61.4pc of the population) and eight million second jabs (15.5pc).  To speed things up, France has increased the gap between the two doses of the mRNA jabs, making the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine available to anyone over 55, and rolled out the first 200,000 doses of the Johnson &amp; Johnson product a week early - also available for this age bracket.  Not all milestones are welcome, however. France this week became the eighth country whose death toll surpassed the 100,000-mark. With an average of roughly 300 deaths a day and almost 6,000 people in intensive care - the highest figure since April last year - government spokesman Gabriel Attal warned that “the third wave is not behind us”, nor is its peak.  There are also growing fears about the possible impact of the Brazilian variant, which along with the South African mutation accounts for 4.2 per cent of French cases and prompted it to suspend flights from Brazil this week.  Given such headwinds, it is too early to say whether Mr Macron, who is up for election in 12 months time, can claim to have been right to refuse to lock the country for a third time in January, despite calls from his own scientific advisors.  Germany, where vaccine roll-out has accelerated dramatically since Easter, is in a similar race against time and its ability to get a handle on the virus could also prove key for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party.  On Wednesday, the country set a new national record with 738.501 jabs in a day, compared with 547,465 in the UK on the same day. Some 18.5 per cent of Germans have now had their first jab, compared to just 12 per cent on April 1. Some 6.4 per cent are fully vaccinated.  While bigger deliveries of vaccines have played a role, the decision to involve GPs in the jab campaign has also been key to the newfound speed.    Doctors administered more than 1.1m in their first week alone and are expected to ramp up even further as dose quantities increase. The gear change could see the entire adult population receive a first jab by July 18, two months early and be fully vaccinated by August 8, according to the German Institute for Public Health Insurance (ZI).  A shadow on the horizon is the concern the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine may cause blood clots. Germany has factored the vaccine heavily into its plans — it is expecting an order of 10m jabs — and any decision to limit its use could slow the country’s roll-out.  Meanwhile, in Italy, daily inoculations are hovering above 200,000 new doses administered per day since late last month. Some 9.7m first doses have been administered and 4.1m second ones. Officials have expressed optimism restrictions could be eased soon if the pace of immunisation continues to pick up. That may be premature. On Wednesday, Italy reported another 16,000 new cases in 24 hours and 469 more deaths.  Indeed, the persistently high infection and death rates and hospitalisations threaten to jeopardise plans to relax rules in the coming weeks as Europeans eye Britain’s lockdown exit with envy.  Keen to cajole a country under nationwide semi-confinement and a 7pm to 6am curfew, Mr Macron held talks with the French government on Thursday night on an exit roadmap and his aides hinted that he aimed to progressive reopen cafes and restaurants, along with cultural venues by mid-May. “  “We need some quick wins to raise morale,” fretted junior social economy minister Olivia Grégoire. “(Reopening) terraces is a small victory to brighten our daily lives.”  But ministers have already warned that this is still only “hypothetical”. Mr Macron will address the nation by the end of the month.  Macron has claimed the EU could catch up with Britain “in the coming weeks” With intensive care beds filling up in Germany, Angela Merkel is struggling to push a new law through parliament to take control of lockdown measures out of the hands of the country’s 16 regional governments and impose tough national restrictions for the first time, including night-time curfews for the worst-hit areas. She has already met fierce political resistance from the regions some of who want to go the other way.  As summer beckons, EU countries, including Germany, France and Italy, remain closed to tourism for now.  But some are forging ahead with holiday plans regardless.  Greece intends to open borders on 14 May for all travellers who have been vaccinated or provide a negative coronavirus test. Croatia says it is opening up those who can prove they have had a second doses at least two weeks previously.  Meanwhile, EU governments have reached a common position on plans for digital vaccination certificates, which could eventually pave the way to a vaccine passport system open to Britons hoping to travel to Europe. The EU-only plans must be agreed with MEPs before they can become law, which could be before the end of June.  Mass vaccinations are key to getting European economies back on track.  Last month, the OECD said it expected the UK economy to grow by 5.1 per cent this year and 4.7 per cent in 2022 - a significant increase on its December 2020 estimate. Its EU growth forecast was also increased to 3.9 per cent for 2021 — however, this was a much smaller uplift than elsewhere due to its slow vaccine rollout.  “Reflecting the periodic infection waves and the pace of vaccinations, the economic recovery in Europe is still halting and uneven,"" said Alfred Kammer, director of the International Monetary Fund's European department.  ""We are suggesting an extra push, and an extra effort"" to limit permanent damage to the region's productivity.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/mthmlk/whisper_it_quietly_europes_vaccination_programme/guzo4tb/

My parents have not had a change in income, have had the time and cash to renovate their house. They aren't interested in going out to eat, or to concerts or to the pub. They've been vaccinated.

Isn't this why typically people end up more Conservative as they age?   Property is a major issue and it's ridiculous that it continues to rise in price. I firmly believe that it needs to be taken back under control but the issue is, to do so its going to probably mean crashing the market and implementing control over how many properties can be owned by one person. Likewise there should be a top limit on rent that is controlled, renting property doesn't really provide much to society, you're essentially just holding on to a house which could be purchased. I'm in London and some rental properties that are multi bedroom, aren't really, its just a house where you've put a bed in every room apart from the bathroom and kitchen. No party has truly committed to social housing in a way that addresses the issues with so many people renting or the affordability of housing.   I find the covid passport issue annoying but less concerning on a personal level. I am very worried about the impact it will have on nightlife though. Nightclubs aren't really an old person's things and they've suffered throughout the pandemic with little support.

330,0,1617477092,"Grandparents could use Covid passport app to screen birthday party guests   Government-backed app will be used by major events and could see fans sit in different parts of stadiums according to their virus status  By Christopher Hope, Chief Political Correspondent 3 April 2021 • 6:30pm  Anyone planning an event or party will be handed the ability to stop them becoming superspreading events by scanning codes on guests' phones  Grandparents will be able to scan Covid passport apps before allowing family members into their birthday parties or gatherings under plans drawn up by a company developing a coronavirus passport app for the Government.    Anyone planning an event or party, in their own home or at a hired-out venue, will be handed the ability to stop them becoming superspreading events by scanning codes on guests' phones, which will grant access if they are vaccinated, have a recent negative test or antibodies from recent infection.  The app will also be used by major events under plans that could see fans sit in different parts of sports stadiums according to their Covid status, according to Netcompany which has been handed a £3million contract to develop Covid certificates.  Office staff would only be allowed to access work places if they can show their Covid status on the app too.  Details are set out in a video of how Covid passports might work which has been posted online by the Danish business, which was hired by the Government on a 12 month contract to develop a digital Covid passport last November.  Last month Denmark appointed Netcompany to develop its coronavirus passport app, which the company said “will contribute to the reopening of society in Denmark”. Netcompany said the app could be ready next month.  Civil liberties campaigners are already sounding the alarm.  Jake Hurfurt, head of research and investigations at Big Brother Watch, said: ""Netcompany’s chilling endorsement of segregated events and biosurveillance of our family members is a warning of the road Covid passes would lead us down.  “This contract shows that ministers misled Parliament and the public, claiming for months there were no plans for Covid passes and still claiming today that no decision has been made. This contract exposes the reality that work began on Covid certificates a long time ago.  “These draconian plans for a checkpoint nation are unnecessary, unworkable and un-British. The Prime Minister should be working to prohibit domestic Covid passes, not promote them.""  The video, titled “Corona passport – how it works”, paints a number of different scenarios involving the fictitious Larssen family – Kasper, Pia and their 14 year old son Thomas.  It sets out how Kasper is vaccinated and then downloads a coronavirus “stay safe” app which contains a digital record in an encrypted QR code of his vaccination and its timing.  For children it can be used to demonstrate to authorities that they have recently tested negative for Covid-19 within the past 48 hours.  Staff can use it to demonstrate to employers that they can work safely with customers because of an up-to-date vaccination or a recent negative test.  A second “stay open” app can be downloaded and used to check that the digital coronavirus passport is valid.  It shows how airlines could access the app to check on passengers’ “corona status” before issuing a boarding card in one instance.  In another example, Netcompany tells how 'Kasper's grandma Joanne' wants to invite family and friends to celebrate her 75th birthday.  “Using the ‘stay open’ app, Grandpa Peter scans the guests before the party begins,” the video says. It adds that “in Denmark citizens need to have received vaccines A, B or C or have a negative test less than 24 hours old to join larger private events”.  Netcompany’s video also sets out how crowds could be segregated in sports stadiums, and allowed to sit together or must remain socially distanced, according to their Covid status.  Government documents seen by The Telegraph show that Netcompany won a £3million contract with “NHS Test &amp; Trace Covid-19 [Redacted] App Programme” on Nov 26 2020.  Much of the contract is redacted. However under a section marked Schedule 1: Services, it says ""the immediate engagements are related to Covid-19 certification and existing Tracing application.  “The certification application will comprise of [sic] the following functionality for ‘Day 1 Technical Release’ or the Initial Release”.  On Saturday a spokesman for Netcompany told The Telegraph: “We have no comments to make on our engagements related to Covid certification/passes.  “And [we] cannot confirm anything else than what can be found in the public available government contract.”  He added: “All scenarios and restrictions displayed in the video referred to in your email are fictitious and only serve the purpose of demonstrating examples of how Covid passes could be used in society.  “Therefore, this video does not reflect the solution defined or chosen by any government, but solely serves as imaginary examples.  “Government solutions would in general build on principles of frictionless and easy usage throughout all user interactions driven by privacy by design to maintain and build citizen trust in the reopening process.”  A Government spokesman said: “The video on Netcompany's website states that all scenarios are fictitious and not indicative of how a certification system might work in the UK.  “No final decisions have been made on how a certification system might work in practice. Any such system that we use will take into account three factors: vaccination, a negative test and natural immunity.  “The review is considering a range of issues, including the ethical, equalities, privacy, legal and operational aspects and what limits, if any, should be placed on organisations using certification.”  A Cabinet source added: “We are never going to have Covid status certification at family parties, nor have we ever considered it.  “It’s about those high risk settings like nightclubs and theatres. Netcompany are just helping with the technical architecture of a possible app.”",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/mjf2uz/grandparents_could_use_covid_passport_app_to/gt9uaxz/

I imagine the governments concern is that groups of young people don't get vaccinated and we get outbreaks - although the same can be said of measles - I used to live in south wales, and we'd get posters up and down the uni halls every year. Although I'd say covid is more comparable to flu than measles (measles spreads on its insane r0, covid will recirculate due to mutations like flu eventually).   The fundamental risk with covid is that we get an imported variant that does not respond well to vaccines. Therefore the goverment shouldnt waste time putting in an unjustified domestic passport scheme, but focus on ensuring the borders are protected from the variants which will inevitably circulate worldwide. Over time the world will become vaccinated, and the variants will become more infrequent and manageable.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/mim0aw/pub_vaccine_passports_not_british_sir_keir_starmer/gt5qy9p/

Can I assume if we go with a Covid vaccine Passport they will use the same logic and apply it to a mandatory test to prevent STIs and give out a passport saying you're cleared?",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/mim0aw/pub_vaccine_passports_not_british_sir_keir_starmer/gt5w5yz/

355,0,1615762375,"&gt;Well what's your opinion?   Probably pop a couple of aspirins before and for 3 months after the last jab to be on the safe side. Most of my colleagues and families are stocking up ahead already.  &gt;Let's assume a these blood clots are because of the vaccine, would you want us to halt the rollout?  No, but people should have the choice which vaccine they want if there are greater risks to one than the other. COVID passport should be suspended until a safe vaccine can be made.  &gt;I'm just sick of lockdown mate, the rarity of the clots seems a price worth paying.  Lockdowns are coming this winter, Whitless already said so, which is suspicious when the population will have been vaccinated twice over plus change.   Does that sound like the behaviour of someone who believes that the vaccines work?

The Brexit scenario means that there’s not separate British-Isle of Man passport anymore. Also there are other odd things like N.I contributions not being compatible. My sister has two Uni aged kids, one born their and one not, and due to gap year, Uni and COVID has been away for over two years so was worried he’s had his ‘citizenship’, as it is colloquially known, taken away from him but pretty sure it’s OK as  full time Uni students, that return to the island, retain their ‘IOM worker’ status so the ‘away for two years’ rule shouldn’t apply.
