1,0,1638679920,"My wife had a similar thought originally with ours but quixkly thought better of it when her friends who were still there told her how hard it is to find a good OB and hospital system over there compared to here.  I'd be too worried about Ukraine's abysmal handling of COVID, the possibility of Russia messing with Marisol by then, the risk of complications that could make it hard for her or the baby to fly home any time soon after birth, the doctors' lack of familiarity with your wife leading up to the birth, the local hospital's capacity to appropriately handle complications if they arise, and the paperwork headaches you and the kid would have to go through now and in the future. Plus, babies come early fairly often, sometimes by a month or more, so this can be hard and stressful to plan for properly and you don't want her giving birth on a plane or while you're a whole ocean away or unable to get there because of travel restrictions.   Complications happen- for example, after nearly a day of labor my wife needed an emergency C section to survive and the baby was jaundiced, but our hospital in the US had it all covered beautifully. Her best friend in Kyiv, by contrast, went into labor early with severe bleeding and was taken to a state hospital (nor the private practice place she'd been planning for) that was not at all personable and didn't even let her husband in there for hours, nor did they even try to minimize C section scarring. How confident are you that she'll definitely be admitted to a place with great quality care and expertise to handle surprises well and put her first and adhere to her birth plan all the way through? How sure are you that they'll let you in to be with her for the whole process, and how sure are you that you'll be able to communicate with the doctors and staff fluently enough in Russian to be effective as her and the baby's advocate if there's any conflict or complication? Will you be able to understand what's happening if there is a complication, or will you just be in blind panic? If she needs physical therapy or the baby needs special treatment or she struggles with post-partum depression, are you fairly certain the resources to deal with that are available in Mariupol and that you'll be able to adjust your travel plans to make sure she and the baby get the care they need first?  Also unless she's moving there, doing this means taking a tired, post-pregnancy mama and a little baby on international flights during COVID whenever you're ready to come home to the US. Right now there are ever-changing, pretty stringent teating requirements, mandatory masking, and the looming threat of more travel bans that will make these flights extra risky and extra difficult, and if this is your first you have NO idea how hard it is to travel with a tiny baby even in normal times. Plus the baby won't be vaccinated against COVID or likely many other things we usually vaccinate babies for in the US, so there's that risk during travel as well.   Also of course you won't be able to bring the baby back without a passport. You'll have to choose whether to try to get a US passport for the baby while in Ukraine if you can manage to do it (I don't even wanna know how complicated it is to get the birth certificate and have it translated and notarized and given to the US embassy or however you do it), or getting the kid a Ukrainian passport- which MIGHT cause an issue if your wife is trying to get away with having dual citizenship, and could be impossible if she has already lost Ukrainian citizenship (there is no birthright citizenship in Ukraine so being born there won't be enough to get the baby a passport). When she goes to exit Ukraine, the border folks will see her US passport but notice that the baby has Ukrainian cirizenship, so that may cause some trouble at the passport control kiosk. If she tries to exit with a Ukrainian passport, the airline won't be OK with that because she won't have an active US visa or green card and the border folks at the kiosk might notice the lack of visa as well and start asking some tough questions. If you don't have a rare direct flight to the US, the baby's passport not matching either of yours might cause delays and stress at security in your connecting airport too.  I'm sure you can find a way to legally and logistically pull this off if you really NEED to but man, if this is your first baby I'm telling you this now: you're going to be exhausted and overwhelmed and not thinking straight enough without also having international travel with a newborn during a pandemic and citizenship/ passport control paperwork to contend with. When y'all think about doing this, always remember that citizenship and the birth experience need to be secondary concerns and the primary, most important thing is to come out of this with a healthy baby and a heavy mama. Make your decisions based on whatever gives you the best chance at that, and forget everything else.",ukraine,t5_2qqcn,/r/ukraine/comments/r95rep/my_wife_is_pregnant_with_our_first_child_in_the/hnadqsz/

For me, I had a much different plan on what to see but some good stuff I found was a soviet tour on trip advisor, 2 hours only but it was just me and the guide and I learnt a hell of a lot about some of the buildings, statues and history of Kyiv and Ukraine. I also just walked around a lot. Every so often I'd see a church stand out or something unique and go explore it, which which led me to walk down another street and end up near another cool thing. I walked for km and km and I dont think I really reached the main tourist areas of Kyiv that much. I'm not brave enough for restraints so I can't recommend anything there but museums, restaurants and some shops will ask for your covid certificate so be aware. Apart from that, the younger people know good English so if you go to tills or checkouts, try and choose younger people incase they need to explain something, also police aren't as corrupt as my government made out. I learnt that they nearly all got replaced 5 years ago to stop that. There's barely any corruption (not none) and they are all young for that reason but keep a passport just incase.

3,0,1637491811,"Wasn't aiming my comment at you, but at the general state of ""what if russia invades"" IT DID, in 2014. But foreign news tried to make it seem like it's some Martians from outer space just backed by russia or something.   &gt;the numbers of fatalities throughout this conflict are much much lower than potential ones in hypothetical open all out war  That's the CEASEFIRE casualties. Cease fire. Has them bomb us dozen of times every day. And then Germany or France whines if Ukraine fires back.  Another problem is that it's hybrid war. They found a very effective weapon that kills much more than russian artillery could dream off: antivaxxers. Russians use insane amounts of money on disinformation campaign and since pandemic started they've been working full time on providing COVID disinformation. Actually several statements by investigators and tons of research backing it up.  It also explains a statistical anomaly: why the hell is Ukraine the lowest-vaccinated country in Europe? It's SIGNIFICANTLY behind others, probably the only state where there's so many idiots paying money to get a fake certificate instead of getting a free vaccine and spend whole 20 seconds in a mobile app to get certified. Here you go, SBU apprehended antivaxxers working for Kremlin: https://imi.org.ua/en/news/charges-pressed-against-russia-handled-anti-vaxxers-who-aimed-to-seize-power-ukrinform-i42393  A typical anti-vax group leader passport: https://www.jpost.com/international/ukraine-says-it-thwarted-plan-by-anti-vaxxers-to-destabilize-country-685309 P.S. REALLY hate their narrative overall, they're the worst kind of news, the ""happy pretender"" ones, not only apprehending some of many disinformation networks doesn't thwart the entire plan, just throws a spanner there, but also their attitude of a ""possible"", ""future"" invasion instead of ongoing war that might be escalated. If people actually used the right words, i.e. a ""full scale offensive campaign"" instead of ""starting an invasion"", it would be less confusing to people who don't follow Ukrainian news for yeats.  Another article on the overall shebang, citing real good sources: https://www.codastory.com/disinformation/ukraine-vaccine-hesitancy/  On bright side, russians do get hoisted by their own petard too: https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/covid-19-disinformation-backfires-russian-deaths-climb-eu-says-2021-10-21/   So yes, they can kill way more people if they use aircraft and/or lead another full scale offensive like in 2014 or 15, but the most effective weapon is the ""vaccine skepticism,"" with way higher mortality rate than any war. Literally daily deaths from COVID are higher than yearly death toll from the war.

15,0,1628198460,"August 5 update:   TLTR: If you’re vaccinated, have their insurance printed out, and you’re not from Russia or India -  everything will go smooth.  ——— We got JJ vaccine 5 days before we left US. Neither upon checkin or upon arrival in Ukraine that date was questioned.   Upon check in (KLM) - requested vaccine card and proof of insurance. Although our American insurance covers us internationally, we bought the one from the website just to avoid any issues.   KLM plane was half full. Very friendly. Everyone was mostly in compliance with mask requirements and had an empty space between their party and another party.   Layover/transfer in Amsterdam - no issues. Only looked at passport and boarding pass.   Both journeys requested social distancing when exiting the plane - both times that was completely ignored. Worse on the Amsterdam to Kiev arm.   On the Amsterdam to Kiev flight, one older man didn’t want to cover his nose with mask, so the flight attendants was getting angry with him and threatened to turn the plane around if he didn’t comply. Although many others had their masks slightly below their noses, I guess his was just more obvious. He eventually covered his face until she walked away.   Getting though border patrol at boryspil airport:  Again, no social distancing followed at all. We arrived at around 2pm - it was busy. Before getting in line, man in uniform ask to see vaccination record or proof of negative test. If someone held up the line, some  snuck through without showing anything. The line for foreign citizens was pst the UA citizens entry line, but somehow Ukrainian citizens ended up in the foreign line so they converted one of the station from “all passports” to “UA citizens.” So it was “all passports” “UA citizens” “all passports” “UA citizens” X5.   Some people were cutting in line, but no one would say anything, I guess because we weren’t sure if they were catching up with their other family members. A couple were. Most weren’t. People working at the airport paid zero attention to that.   The lines were getting backed up by people why either didn’t have proof of insurance printed and clearly showing coverage in Ukraine, or if they weren’t vaccinated and struggled to activate the “Vdoma” app. I did not see any Russian or Indian citizens (explain more later).    Once I got to the border patrol, I gave him my passport, CDC vaccination card, and printed copy of UA insurance. He only asked the name of my vaccine, which after 24 hrs of traveling and not sleeping (can’t sleep on planes) I struggled with😅. Asked me to lower my mask and take off my glasses, stared at my face for what felt like forever and let me go.   Once we got our luggage we went through the green customs line (not having to declare anything), but a girl came up to us to ask where we were coming from, what we were bringing and how much money we had. We said personal belongings and the amount was under the restricted amount. She smiled and said thank you so we went on.   Next we needed to get a taxi. The signs where to get taxi weren’t clear. The security at the door  wasn’t helpful. Tired and just wanting to get to our place of rest we went outside and took up one of the guys offering the taxi. The price was $35, which is about 2.5 times the fair market value (I checked beforehand). The guy acts as a call agent and takes half from the taxi driver he calls. At this point we didn’t mind, similar trip would be similarly priced in the US. Thankfully we got a nice and polite driver with Citrion that fit our 4 bags of luggage.   About Indians and Russians. When we walked outside the terminal, there were many camera men and journalists. Someone even came up to us to take interview - we weren’t interested. Later on TV saw a segment about all the people they were defining from Russia. Rules for Russia and India require that anyone arriving in boryspil EVEN IF TRANSFERRING quarantine in Ukraine for 14 days without possibility of testing. There are families traveling  from Turkey to Russia through Ukraine and now they have to stay in Ukraine for 2 weeks. Given what I said earlier about how no one gave a *** about social distancing lines, I don’t see how this 2 week rule helps the COVID situation. Obviously they showed some very upset people, one guy punched the border patrol person, one threw his phone on the ground, another tried to bribe the agent. This was upsetting to watch and I am glad we didn’t see any of it in person while at the airport.   General observation about Boryspil. All staff speaks to you in Ukrainian before speaking English. Maybe because I was born there and still have my round Eastern European cheeks, but I found it weird for an international airport - main in the country. Some staff obviously didn’t speak English. If I didn’t know Russian or Ukrainian - this would stress me out. Overall I was hoping for more cleanliness, order, and organization. It wasn’t terrible, but I think they can and should improve their catering towards foreign citizens. Especially coming from Schiphol airport - the contrast was night and day. There were some Dutch, Americans, Canadians, and middle eastern tourists in the foreign line with us and I had wished their first impression of Ukraine could be better.
