53,0,1639302110,"Just did a Canada to India non stop flight today. Going to share my experience to help others who are contemplating travelling to India right now. Documents: Needed 3 documents in order to complete the whole process as smoothly as possible: Negative RTPCR, Air Suvidha, Vaccine certificate. Upon checking in, air suvidha was required although info was not checked, vaccine certificate was scanned. I had already submitted my Covid test to air Canada while checking in online and so it was pre approved. Upon boarding, none of the suckers were requested.Here is the really surprising part: after landing in Delhi we were told by security present at the door to form a line and have our air suvidha and boarding pass ready. When I got to the front of the queue they only cared about the fact that you had a paper in your hand that resembled an air suvidha form. No information was checked or cross verified. In fact, the guy who was stamping my boarding pass did not even glance towards my air suvidha form once. After the boarding pass was stamped, none of the documents were required again. Overall I found the experience relatively easy and straightforward , it was probably more strict in Canada as the vaccine proof was requested two times in total and air suvidha once. In India only air suvidha was requested (but not checked). Also no one from my flight (as far as I can tell) was told to get tested again as part of that 2% group.

56,0,1638550861,"I have read that Lancet paper. The numbers I quoted earlier are from it. It raised a valid point - that ARR needs to be considered - but seemed to give the impression that RRR is useless. See [this](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00119-1/fulltext) reply and [this](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00120-8/fulltext) counter-reply.  The difference between ARR and RRR is described very well [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2021/04/12/relative-vs-absolute-risk-reduction-500-doctors-want-to-know/). Both are valid metrics, and both need to be considered when looking at the efficacy of a new medicine or vaccine. However, RRR has the advantage of being independent of factors such as the age, gender or underlying medical conditions. As you pointed out, a 25 year old is at much less risk compared to a 65 yea old. But both enjoy the same RRR to any given vaccine.  Finally, in matters like this, we as individuals need to do a cost-benefit analysis. The vaccine is free in India and many other countries, so there is no monetary cost. You can walk into your nearest PHC with an ID card and get it. It has a tiny risk of causing blood clots (&lt;0.001%) and a much higher reduction in risk of dying from covid (0.13% by your calculations, for a healthy 25yo, and I feel that that is an underestimate). So I feel that it is worth it.

Delhi handling the migration of other states workers)  * Govt. then poured money into research and development of vaccine and now we are so much capable that we are exporting medicines to 50+ countries.   * Govt. provided help in basic need of poor people who were totally dependent on God to save them. Gave them free and very cheap ration for months, gave money, motivated people in various ways.   * I don't say that only govt did this many organisations and peoples on their own did that but on the scale that it was i haven't seen that long line and satisfied people when they got free ration.   * Planning, managing and executing all this was done by govt and none of this is happened by जादू, various people in their field of expertise gave there everything to make this happen, some are no longer with us (ॐ शांति 🙏🏻)  Though govt collected funds but even then money was used by govt. own pocket.

113,0,1631438374,"&gt;Over 72 crore vaccine doses have been administered since the vaccination campaign against COVID-19 was flagged off on January 16 this year by Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. To provide a proof of vaccination for each of these individuals, Co-WIN is already issuing a digitally verifiable certificate. This certificate can be saved on a digital device (smartphone, tablet, laptop etc.) or stored in Digi Locker from where it can be digitally shared as and when required as a proof of vaccination. Similarly, at entry points where such certificate is required (e.g., in malls, office complex, public events etc.), it may be shown in both the digital and physical forms.   However, there may be instances where an entity does not need to see the certificate in full and would just need to know whether an individual has been vaccinated or not. A few of such possible use cases could be as follows:   An enterprise/employer may like to know the vaccination status of its employees to resume functions in offices, workplaces etc.   ii) The Railways may want to get the status of vaccination of the passengers who are getting their seats reserved in the trains.   iii) Airlines may want to get the status of vaccination of the passengers who are booking their flight tickets, and/or airports may only want to allow vaccinated passengers to pass through.   iv) Hotels may want to know the vaccination status of the residents at the time they are checking into the hotel, or at the time of making online bookings.   As the socio-economic activities are being gradually revived while maintaining everyone’s safety, there is a need for a way to digitally convey the status of individuals’ vaccination to entities with whom they may be engaging with for any or all reasons, as employees, passengers, residents etc.   Therefore, there is a need to enable an Aadhaar like authentication service for the status of vaccination through Co-WIN. To take care of these cases and others that may come up, Co-WIN has developed a new API called ‘Know Your Customer’s/Client’s Vaccination Status’ or KYC-VS. To use this API, an individual needs to enter his/her mobile number and name. Thereafter, they will get an OTP which they have to enter. In return, Co-WIN will send a response to the verifying entity on the individual’s status of vaccination, which will be as follows –   0 - Person is not vaccinated   1 - Person is partially vaccinated   2 - Person is fully vaccinated   This response will be digitally signed and can be shared instantly with the verifying entity. A real-life example could be when at the time of booking a railway ticket, an individual will input the necessary details for buying the ticket and if required, the concerned entity will also get the vaccination status in the same transaction, with the due consent of the individual.   KYC-VS will facilitate all such use cases and more. It is both consent-based and privacy preserving. Additionally, in order to facilitate quick integration and faster adoption, the Co-WIN Team has prepared a webpage with the API, which may be embedded in any system. This will allow for a seamless integration with any system in no time.   Besides the use cases pointed out, this service may be utilized by any service provider, private or public, for whom verifying an individual’s vaccination status is critical for facilitating a service requested.

The name is mandatory hence SOME name has to be put in  I was not made to sit for a few minutes for observation and was immediately let go. - Making you sit for 30 minutes was a protocol following in the beginning of when the vaccinations started, as and when centres noticed that there is no need to have people sit for so long, and to avoid crowding the space which would be even more contagious for infections to spread - they will ask you to leave if you are feeling fine I'm not experiencing any post-vaccination effect at all. - The side-effects kick in after 12-18 hours, so wait and watch how it goes.

160,0,1626242298,"There is a smidgen of truth in your points. However it is not enough to absolve the govt.   Yes the US and UK invested in the vaccine research, so they would always have a leg up. That's fine, but they didn't ask us to delay placing orders until Jan 2021, days before we began the vaccination campaign. Other countries had placed orders in the middle of last year.   Even when we did order, we ordered 14M doses, which is barely enough to vaccinate *Bangalore*, let alone the whole country.   And then there was the absolutely insane strategy of having three different types of buyers (union govt, state govts and private hospitals) face off against a duopoly of vaccine producers. In fact it was effectively a monopoly because covaxin production numbers are negligible compared to covishield. Any economist can tell you that a market where there's a monopoly against a fragmented group of buyers, heavily favors the monopolist. The govt created this monopoly/duopoly by allowing only two vaccines for several months. And this resulted in India paying more for vaccines than other countries that were importing the same vaccines from India. So far nobody has been able to explain the rationale behind creating this massively complex system.   Does this mean we wouldn't have problems if the govt had acted correctly? No. Vaccination across the world has faced challenges due to supply chain issues, embargoes and patent laws leading to vaccine apartheid. For these the western world can and should be held accountable. But the Indian govt made many unforced errors and persisted with them even when it was clear that their moves were having devastating consequences.  India had the resources to do this - if only the attention had been in getting the doses into people's arms instead of getting the PMs photo on the vaccine certificate.",india,t5_2qh1q,/r/india/comments/ojvrwl/it_was_humanly_not_possible_to_control_covid/h54j3ud/
161,1,1626244991,"&gt;India had the resources to do this - if only the attention had been in getting the doses into people's arms instead of getting the PMs photo on the vaccine certificate.  Thanks for putting it so succintly. And also thanks for not jumping at me, everybody is too busy with downvotes just because I asked a question. Although I guess someone might think I'm sealioning, and since this policy has resulted in so many deaths, I cant really complain.  From what I'm understanding, India allocated 35k crores for vaccine procurement. However it placed its orders too late(should have been placed \~aug 2020, but was placed in jan 2021), and that too a very negligibile amount of orders were placed. Just 16M doses amounting to \~600crore, which is a very tiny % of the 35000 crore alloted.  So that proves that India had the money to place orders, and thereby increase production of vaccines, but chose not to out of hubris. Shameful.

223,1,1621547391,"&gt; Saying things like why doesn't he want his photo on the death certificate is patently silly. Just think for a moment -- which leader has ever put their photo to a negative event. To even go down that track shows your bias and frankly inability to understand the complexities of Indian politics.  Wierd how you show a complete inability to understand the changed reality of Indian politics since modi came to power. What's MMS equivalent of vaccination certificate with his photo? Vajpayee equivalent? Devegowda equivalent? Maybe VP Singh equivalent? Nehru - surely, you must have Nehru putting his own pictures on certificates and shit and naming stadia after himself? No?  You are a Modi apologist to not recognize that playing by fair rules against a man who refuses to play fair is conceding the game.   Its also very enlightening how you fail to recognize all the other points about Modi retaining control of the pandemic response while apportioning responsibilities I made, and zeroed in on pics on vaccination certificates. Have some shame, and address these other points, before you start sharing the blame with states:  &gt;he refuses to spend more than a tenth of the amount budgeted for the vaccine; he changes uttarakhand cm for daring to suggest covid precautions for kumbh - not even cancelling it; getting compliant EC to stretch out Bengal elections and continue holding massive rallies in multiple states; getting goons from his party to protest and riot in opposition ruled states while demanding opening of temples and permissions for large scale religious festivities; controls oxygen and medical supplies and uses those to hurt people of the states ruled by opposition.  Trust me, when you have a multivariate problem where one variable accounts for 85% of the variance and other 35 variables split the other 15% more or less equally, its pointless to work on reducing variance of each of those 35 variables till you've substantially controlled the largest variable.   Yes, AK has fucked up big and he's playing petty politics to distract from his failures. Yes, Uddhav could have mitigated the problem by acting a little faster. Yes, Yeddy could have tried to curb profiteering of his cronies and tried helping bangaloreans find beds and so could have 30 other chief ministers/local administrators - but none of these could have made a dent in the order of magnitude of the modimade disaster.

226,2,1621504610,"So yesterday afternoon I got my first dose of Covishield vaccine at one of the Apollo hospitals in Chennai. It was a relatively smooth process, and I will share the process in brief so that it can be helpful for you to plan for your vaccination:  (1) Booking vaccination appointment: Finding a slot &amp; booking on the Cowin portal is not an easy task. However, there are many apps/tools that can help in doing that &amp; I used the Paytm app - Vaccine Finder tool to search for available slots in Chennai. If you are unable to find a slot, don't worry - the Paytm tool has a very useful option for sending us Notifications whenever slots are opened. For that, you need to keep the Paytm app minimised/put in the background of your smartphone. Then, whenever slots are opened, you will get a Notification mentioning the hospital name, pincode &amp; no. of slots available. Then, immediately open the Paytm tool through which you can login to the Cowin portal &amp; check the slots which have become available &amp; book your appointment. Please note that this process needs to be done very rapidly, like even a few seconds delay can cause you to miss the booking! Think of like Tatkal booking, but 10x more difficult!!! After trying for three days continuously, finally I managed to book a slot by sheer luck!  (2) Preparing for the appointment: Once appointment is booked, please download the PDF confirmation of the same on your mobile phone. If possible, better take a printout &amp; carry it with you. Also, please ensure to take your Aadhar Card original with you to the Hospital (AADHAR CARD IS COMPULSORY. If you don't bring it, they will refuse to vaccinate you) &amp; also take a pen and notebook as you may have to fill out some forms at the Hospital.  (3) Travel to the vaccination center: This is a bit of a hassle now, as Chennai police are enforcing strict lockdown, they are not allowing two-wheelers or autos to travel from one locality to another. There are barricades at all road junctions &amp; police are stopping all vehicles and asking questions. However, if you have a personal car or booked an Uber/Ola cab to go to the Hospital, then the police won't bother you. Please be ready to show your appointment PDF document or printout whenever they ask. I personally was questioned at two junctions &amp; after I showed my printout &amp; Aadhar Card, they allowed me to proceed.  (4) At the hospital - initial formalities: Upon reaching the Hospital, I was asked to fill out a form with my personal details as well as Aadhar number &amp; Appointment code. We were asked to wait outside in a covered Parking Lot with seats sufficiently spaced out from each other to ensure social distancing. There were around 20-25 people seated there &amp; mask wearing was strictly enforced by the security. They called 10 people at a time to enter the hospital, did temperature checks &amp; offered sanitizer to clean our hands before entering. Once entered, we had to go to the billing counter where they checked my documents, asked me if I have any cold/fever/any comorbidities &amp; since I didn't have any, they asked me to proceed with making the payment of Rs. 850/- (as right now Apollo are offering only Paid Covishield vaccine for 18-45 age group). Then we were asked to wait inside. This entire waiting &amp; formalities process took around 30-40 mins.  (5) Vaccine injection: A few mins after being seated, I was called inside a room to take the vaccine injection. They showed me the Covishield vaccine vial &amp; injected the vaccine as a single syringe shot in my left arm (similar to a Tetanus injection). Afterwards, I was told be seated in another waiting room for 20 mins just to observe if I get any adverse reactions to the vaccine dose.  (6) Completion of formalities: While waiting inside the room, within 5-10 mins, I got an SMS confirmation reg the vaccine 1st dose I had taken &amp; it gave me a link to open/download the Vaccination Certificate PDF &amp; I was able to download it easily. Once the 20 mins waiting time was over, I left the Hospital to head back home.  (7) Travel back to home: While returning back home, as usual police checking at each road junction, but no issues &amp; I was able to reach home easily. I didn't get any tiredness or sickness that we were warned about getting after taking vaccine shot, so it was good.  (8) Post vaccine illness/symptoms: I luckily didn't get any major symptoms like fever or body pain, but at night I did feel little tired &amp; with slight headache. However since today morning I am feeling fine &amp; normal. So far so good.  That was my experience with getting 1st dose of Covishield vaccine in Chennai.

I'm currently sitting at home riding out a sick day from my vaccine shot and since my work has a strict 'No disturbance during a sick day' policy, I have some time to recover, think about what you've mentioned and document it all here, so enjoy.   Let's start with some general notes:   a) **This is strictly about finances.** How your educational and other factors really help to determine eligibility overall, but those can be worked on too.   b) **Assumptions.** I'm assuming in this case that both of you have at least a Bachelors' degree (quite possible) and are (likely) unmarried, given your ages.   c) **Canada as Frame of Reference:** I will be using Canada as a frame of reference for discussions, but you can do your research on other immigration programs to chart out what it would be for other countries - Aus/NZ/EU, etc.   d) **Timelines:** Your move to said country will not be immediate - you need to think long term and your long-term planning needs to be sound because it's not something you can action immediately. You need to do the groundwork, plan and prepare. So if you're thinking about going tomorrow, or next year - stop. What I'm going to talk about below is basically what you need to build towards to breeze through it when you're ready so as soon as the final step is in place, you're a go.   e) **CRS Scores:** When I qualified for the program, I scored a rather high CRS score of 481 which allowed me to move quickly. [Here's a breakdown of my score.](https://i.imgur.com/GDhPLBt.png) But I had something that (I'm assuming) you don't, which was a Masters degree that gave me some more points in the CRS score. For a considerable chunk of points, you should be looking at the following:   i) Under 30 years of age (ideally, unmarried gives you better points than married does, but more on that later)   ii) At least 2 - 3 years of work experience under the NOC code you're applying under  iii) High IELTS General scores - we're talking 8.0 and above on every section, no exceptions  iv) Something that's equivalent to a Bachelor's degree, as per WES. They have an estimator on their website. Obviously, if you have a Master's degree and it is Ontario-equivalent, nothing like it!  [You can find out your current CRS scores here.](https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp)   Now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about specifics:  #Age  **All of you have an advantage here. You're young!** I first thought about moving when I was 28 - I landed in Canada in a month after I turned 30. A lot of the available programs for now really start to penalize you for age after 30, so you all should score high marks in this sector. Additionally, the later you move, the harder it could be to adapt because there's good chance you'll need to start your working life in Canada a rung or two below the position you had in India.   #Current Savings  Before we begin, let's work on trying to build up a 'shopping list' of items that are going to be a part of this adventure:   1. [Proof of Funds](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/proof-funds.html): This is what the government asks you to show that you'll be able to support yourself in your new life in Canada. This is a sliding scale that depends on the number of applicants in your application. In case you do plan to get married between now and then, see one of the sections below about it. Assuming 1 person, for now, the current amount is CAD 12,960 (with today's current forex because of the abnormally high CAD atm, is around INR 7,85,394.92 as of writing this, so around 8 lakhs.)  2. [PR Application fees:](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/apply-permanent-residence.html) CAD 1,325 or INR 80,288.37 , or around 80.5k INR  3. [WES Certification of your degree to show its equivalency to a Canadian bachelors:](https://www.wes.org/ca/evaluations-and-fees/eca/) 220 CAD, or INR 13330.90, so around 13.5k INR  4. [IELTS General Test](https://www.britishcouncil.in/exam/ielts/dates-fees-locations) INR 14,700  5. [India PCC Application](https://www.passportindia.gov.in/AppOnlineProject/fee/feeInput): You'd need to get this done at some point towards the middle of the process. Costs INR 500  6. [PR Medical Expenses](https://www.lilavatihospital.com/Visa-Investigation): Costs associated with doing your medicals for the PR process towards the end of the process itself. Typically costs around  5,000 - 9,000 INR. I got mine done at Lilavati back in 2016, and it was around 7,000 INR.   Those are what I'd call 'The big 6' costs, of which the 'Proof of Funds' isn't even really a cost at all; they're literally showing your savings that you intend to use when you land in Canada. You only need to show you have this and that it's not with any strings attached and you're in the clear.   ***So, with the five real costs outlined, you're looking at a final total of 1,15,819.27, aka 1.15 lakh INR. So with your Proof of Funds, that's about 9.15 lakhs at a minimum.***  Now, there could be other miscellaneous items associated with this too:  a) If you lived in any country other than India (whose cost was already mentioned above) for longer than 6 months within the past 10 years before you plan to apply, you gotta produce a Police Clearance Certificate for each country. That cost can vary depending on the country but it's not terribly expensive relative to the other options outlined above.  b) Married at the point of application? Effectively double some of those expenses, because there are two of you.  c) Training material for IELTS, courier costs...this is going to depend on how you approach it.     Now, to come to specifics on this:   **/u/homosapien2014 :**   You stated 6L as your savings and 13L as your earning capacity for now, you're sitting pretty. You're already about 60% away from the target you need to hit financially.   **/u/Assasin-ed :**   You stated 50k. I wouldn't say you're in bad shape per se, you're also young and my earnings as an artist back then were similar to yours so I can relate.   Having said that, you have ways to go on that front, but again, it's not impossible. Something that nobody tells you is that your family and friends have the ability to 'gift deed' you the balance amount as a way of raising your Proof of Funds. I'm not going to comment on whether that's a possibility in your situation, but I wanted to put it out there as a valid option for you to pursue. I know someone who did that; their dad gave them 5 Lakhs as a gift deed and when he came to Canada and settled in, he earned that money back in short order and gifted it back to his father and bought them a car as a way of saying thank you. 'Nary a dry eye in the audience, etc.   Additionally, like I said before - you're young, your earning capacity can grow and you need to focus on saving. You have a runway of at least 5 years to get the above together.   **/u/corporatededmeat :**   You stated 10L (*Sirf dal kha rahe ho kya, bc?* I didn't have nearly that much in savings when I was 24, lol :D)  Good news for you too, you're already there savings-wise, savings wise but you should add some more and get to work on that work experience, seeing as you're a fresh grad.   **Now, the million-dollar question - what do you need to do to prepare?**  1. Sit down, pen and paper out timelines. Look up the pre-requisites like I mentioned above.   2. Use the first free consultations of a few migration consultants (except Y-Axis, they're *chors*) to get a sense of if you're on the right track. I did this and I found that they were useful and going to them prepared also allows you to see right through their bullshit because often they'll have their own racket going on. Had one of those nitwits tell me my WES ECA was 'wrong' so they'd need to order a fresh one for me. He can suck it, I made it through just fine so he was full of shit and wanted to pocket some extra money because he quoted double what the WES site was actually charging.   3. For things you're not certain about, go [here](https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-discussion-board/) - This is the one source of truth for anything you need to know about Canadian immigration, for example. There will likely be similar communities on Facebook or the internet for the chosen country you want to go to.   4. Set up goals - set up a financial account for immigration money, send your savings there, take stock of how much you've reached for Proof of Funds and for the big 6 expenses. Keep a regular track of this and keep an ear to the rails if something changes so you can modify the plan accordingly. Similar, set milestone dates for when you should start work on getting some stuff done - I can tell you right now that getting the WES is a painful experience because it depends on your university giving a specific document and either mailing directly to them (you know what grade A *chutiyas* Indian colleges are so good luck lol) or giving you a sealed, stamped envelop with the transcripts that you mail to WES for approval.   5. Start digitizing your documents, like... ALL your documents. From your birth certificate to your passport, start scanning and saving two versions of it. A high quality, high file size 'Original Master' and a compressed low-quality version. You'll need to refer to this a lot when you apply. Pay stubs, income tax filing, bank statements, everything. Download and store everything, set up reminders to download this stuff online or go into your bank branch and have them give you everything signed and stamped for your accounts and keep it. You're going to be likely printing out enough paperwork for the application to massacre a small forest, so best be prepared for it ahead of time.",india,t5_2qh1q,/r/india/comments/nezsm0/emigrate_used_to_be_a_meme_on_rindia_i_cannot/gylvdxv/

282,0,1617178556,"&gt; Brazilian health regulator Anvisa said Bharat Biotech's Covaxin Covid-19 does not meet its manufacturing standards, according to a note in the Tuesday edition of the official gazette.    The Brazilian government signed a contract last month to buy 20 million doses of the Indian drugmaker's vaccine. Bharat Biotech applied for emergency use of the vaccine in Brazil on March 8.    &gt;   &gt;Bharat and its Brazilian partner Precisa Medicamentos said in a statement that they would appeal the decision and would present evidence that it is complying with all requirements.   &gt;   &gt;Covaxin has been approved for use in five countries, including India, the statement said.  This is what the article says. It's not TLDR. It's the whole goddamn article. The author didn't even bother to at-least copy-paste other important information from an already written article.  Here is more info from [The Wire](https://science.thewire.in/health/brazil-bharat-biotech-covaxin-anvisa-manufacturing-standards-certificate/):  &gt;The Brazilian health regulator Anvisa (short for the Portuguese Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitári), has ***denied a certificate for good manufacturing practices*** to Bharat Biotech, who it was inspecting as part of the process to procure its COVID-19 vaccine, Covaxin.   &gt;   &gt;The announcement that ***Bharat Biotech’s vaccine does not meet its manufacturing standards*** was published in a note on the March 30 edition of the official gazette.   &gt;   &gt; *UOL* noted in Portuguese that the reasons why Covaxin fell short of manufacturing standards included its reported “failure to comply with several…rules and instructions on good production practices.” **The problems relate to non-adherence to demands for documentation, methods of analysis, and integrity of containers. Methods used for “sterilising, disinfecting, removing or inactivating viruses” also came under the scanner**, *UOL* reported.",india,t5_2qh1q,/r/india/comments/mgxr35/brazil_regulator_says_bharat_biotechs_covaxin/gsw8e19/
283,1,1617238431,"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/bharat-biotech-covaxin-brazil-7253118/  &gt; Brazil’s health regulator has rejected an application to give Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin a certificate of Good Manufacturing Practices following an inspection of the company’s site in Hyderabad earlier this month.   &gt; An inspection by Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitari (ANVISA) from March 1-5 revealed issues related to the Hyderabad-headquartered vaccine maker’s manufacturing processes. According to the regulator, these issues could potentially risk the quality of the vaccine, and the action plan it sent was not sufficient to mitigate the risks.  &gt; “The requirements pointed out during inspection will be fulfilled, the timelines for fulfillment is under discussion with the Brazil NRA and will be resolved soon,” stated Bharat Biotech in response to the issue.  &gt; According to ANVISA’s statement on its decision, different non-conformities were found at Bharat Biotech’s manufacturing site that denote a significant risk to the manufacture and product quality assurance. This, in turn, implies a health risk for users of the vaccine in Brazil, according to the regulator.  &gt; **Major issues flagged include safety-related observations that the company had not validated the method of analysis to prove complete inactivation of the virus (to prove that it was killed). According to ANVISA, considering that Covaxin is an inactivated vaccine, the company needs to ensure that the virus was completely inactivated, otherwise live SARS-CoV-2 viruses may be present in the vaccine.**  &gt; The regulator also felt that the **company was not taking all the necessary precautions to guarantee the product’s sterility and a lack of adequate control strategies to guarantee the vaccine’s purity.**  &gt; Other observations were that **the company does not use a specific control method to quantify the antigen content and potency of the vaccine** . The vaccine may have **variations in antigen content and consequently compromise its effectiveness** , according to the regulator.  &gt; Precisa Medicamentos **presented an action plan on March 17** to resolve these issues, but the **measures effectively adopted so far have not been sufficient to mitigate the risks associated with the non conformities indicated** , according to ANVISA.  &gt; “If ANVISA has inspected this facility and found it not meeting its standards, it has options to say it will never buy this product or to ask the company to make corrections so that it can take a call after another inspection,” said vaccine expert Dr Gagandeep Kang, Professor, Christian Medical College-Vellore.  &gt; “The company should take it very seriously and our regulator should take it very seriously, and either do an independent inspection and confirm whether there really is a problem that needs to be corrected or push back,” she added.  This is the first non-Indian regulator to review the vaccine I guess, would be interesting to see FDA/WHO's reports as well.",india,t5_2qh1q,/r/india/comments/jj8aog/coronavirus_covid19_megathread_news_and_updates_7/gsz8t3e/
