0,0,1637752681,"u/Fame-taker,     Thank you very much for your input.     The results are in within a few days upto a few weeks, of the Titer test that is.  The problem with the Titer test is that some website speak about ""no less than 3 months after the Titer test you can travel"" and others don't.  It's possible it all just got lost in translation, but I'd rather be safe than sorry.     I do believe that most of it is in order for him to travel with me:  \- international passport   \- chip   \- vaccinated against Rabies his entire life on a yearly basis   \- vaccinated against a collection of other diseases     What I do not understand is the link between the chip and the Rabies vaccine (rabies shot should be visible in chip)?",Turkey,t5_2qlnu,/r/Turkey/comments/r1110i/travelling_to_turkey_with_my_dog/hlw0399/

2,1,1637359874,"Yes. No one can know you exposed or not without PCR testing. You can get your vaccine passport on Hayat Eve Sığar app if you need it. You’ll show your HES code if they ask, thats all. There is nothing complicated.",Turkey,t5_2qlnu,/r/Turkey/comments/qxde19/how_exactly_does_the_hes_code_work_right_now/hlb97ex/
3,0,1636614946,&gt;But they blame us because we dont check our airports enough.  &amp;#x200B;  That's not true. Airlines do check if the customers have a valid visa also have a pcr test or vaccine or filled an online form etc. according to rules of the destination country. General security is tighter than many other countries in europe aswell. Normally you don't go through security 2 times because you don't have to. Only requirement is going through security for the clean area and you do that after you go through your passport control. In Turkey there is also a security right at the entrance of the terminal.,Turkey,t5_2qlnu,/r/Turkey/comments/qr4qrl/help_me_understand_what_is_going_on_please_what/hk6dfzj/
4,0,1635034812,"You either need the hes code to show you are vaccinated or pay for an expensive PCR test every time you enter places  Turkey has vaccine passports in practice for everything. The only thing that is not under a restriction is the grocery markets. They just never called it a vaccine passport but made up a word for ""HES code"".  But we can easily convert it to EU approved vaccine passport through e-government appliances with one click and I believe they call it vaccine passport there  So the debate over vaccine passports from western influences never really entered the Turkish discourse but it is effectively a vaccine passport, it was a smart decision. We had restrictions placed with hes code way before any western country did, you guys over there are actually just following along. We generally don't have much anti vax rheotoric here and muh personal freedoms talk is not a thing either. I mean for other vaccines we used to line up in school for ""vaccine day"" when we were kids to get vaccinated, every Turkish person has that ugly bcg vaccine mark on their arm from school, it was mandatory. That vaccine is also associated with lower death risk from covid if you had it as a kid, so it served us well for lower death rates before biontech. Anti vax discourse is right up along there with flat earther or agartha/ alien believers here so cray cray. Our new centralized health records also has electronic vaccine calendar for kids, those total health records are accessible from schools, family physicians and hospitals when they get your ID number. You can see that screen by googling ""e-nabız""  Don't tell your parents. Let them get bamboozled and waste money lol",Turkey,t5_2qlnu,/r/Turkey/comments/qecxun/how_is_turkey_as_a_destination_for_immigration/hhsx3z1/
5,0,1634322779,After the add your passport number the app you can make a Republic of Turkey Vaccine Id. Or if you want you can call the Ministry of Health Comminucation Center (SABIM). It's phone number is 184.,Turkey,t5_2qlnu,/r/Turkey/comments/q8t09a/how_to_get_vaccination_status_added_to_hes_code/hgrq239/
6,0,1633346791,"&gt;An I a foreign passenger in this case?  Yes.  The ""Foreign ID Code"" is not the HES Code. It is given only to noncitizen permanent residents.  The HES code is not a vaccine passport system. It is a contact tracing code. In the case of Turkish nationals since the last month or so it does carry vaccine and PCR info but you don't need to worry about that.   You'll use the HES code at places which require one.",Turkey,t5_2qlnu,/r/Turkey/comments/pzx2tz/visiting_several_places_during_covid/hfc7j6p/
7,0,1631126676,"Ya, I came from the US with my dog and I had to get one form filled out from the USDA and it was a general health questionnaire. My vet filled it out with rabies vaccine dates and it said her breed and age. That was it. I literally tried to give it to the passport control people and they didn’t even look at it. It was very relaxed. My dog was just walking right beside me as well so they could clearly see her. It was hard to find reliable information online but the most up to date info I found was from the Turkish embassy website in America. You could try to reach out to the Turkish embassy from your departing country and ask. But it was honestly very relaxed. I think EU countries require Titer tests depending on where your coming from but I’m almost certain Turkey does not.",Turkey,t5_2qlnu,/r/Turkey/comments/pkbb6o/pet_home_quarantine_after_moving_to_turkey/hc3aa9e/
