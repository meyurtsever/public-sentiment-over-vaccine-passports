0,0,1642036885,"&gt;What someone like me need to be able to live away from. My parents? What IDs? I have my Passport birth Certificate And my COVID Vaccination Card  You're gonna need more than just IDs to live away from your parents. You're going to need a job.  &gt;How much money would I need for atleast 6 months? I know how much rent, electricity and Water would cost. I do Not Accurately know how much food would cost per month. For me It seems like 10-15k, is this close to yours?  The money you would need depends on what kind of lodging and lifestyle you'll have. 10 - 15K for six months is too low. If you're used to having comfortable lodgings, it's going to be 10k a month. If you bed-space instead, you can save money, but you'll potentially be spending 7 to 8k a month anyway.   &gt;Also I may decide to leave as soon as 18 but COVID may ramp up again and they may decide only 21+ can go buy groceries. Is there anyway to fake my age or identity?  They don't check the age in both the vaccine and quarantine passes, so I don't think you should go making fake documents or identities which is a crime. If ever they do restrict people below 21, you can always reason that you're living alone.",Philippines,t5_2qjov,/r/Philippines/comments/s1ydg8/need_to_leave_toxic_household/hsfes0z/

And now the mayors want the unvaccinated banned from going to restaurants, malls, groceries. I'm pretty sure those who did not get the boosters will be considered ""unvaccinated"" in the future. Fck Isko moreno and all these mayors.  I didnt get the vaccination because i already had covid back in March of 2021. There's this thing called ""natural immunity"". It was unneccessary for me to get the jab, and i never had the virus again after getting sick with it. But I finally decided to get the vaccine after they announced a ""lockdown for the unvaccinated"".   But this vaccine mandate/passport that the govt officials are forcing upon us is too much. This will backfire bigly for those (isko moreno) who favored this and this will wreck our economy for sure. Booster shots 3 to 4 times a year for new variants, long lines at the crack of dawn, businesses having only half the customers it usually gets because of the mandates, good luck with that.

30,0,1626080425,"The EU's ""Digital COVID Certificate"", which is colloquially referred to as the EU's ""vaccine passport"" is a one-pager document that's supposed to make it easy for people to travel through and across the Schengen region by having a singularly-recognized, uniform declaration of a person's vaccination status.  It's this thing that supposedly only recognizes Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and AstraZeneca (specifically, the Western-manufactured version of AZ, and not the licensed versions of AZ from India, South Korea, or Thailand).  The ""rumor"" about Sinovac (and other vaccines) is based on how the Digital COVID Certificate has not yet been uniformly implemented across all EU countries, and __the EU has given its member states individual discretion on recognizing/allowing vaccines that the European Medicines Agency has not yet approved__.  For example: https://www.dw.com/en/which-eu-countries-accept-vaccinated-travelers/a-57808870  &gt; **People entering Spain** from what it deems ""risk"" areas — including many EU members and most other countries in the world — **can avoid quarantine requirements by showing proof of full vaccination with a jab approved by** the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or **the World Health Organization (WHO) at least 14 days before arriving**, proof of recovery from COVID-19, or a negative test.  [and noting here that Sinovac is included within this classification of vaccines approved by the WHO, even if it is not (yet) approved by the EMA]  &gt; **The Greek government** lists the following vaccines among those accepted: Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax, Johnson and Johnson, **Sinovac**, Sputnik V, Casino Biologics, and Sinopharm.  In contrast:  &gt; France recognizes all vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency and considers travelers fully vaccinated two weeks after their final dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or AstraZeneca jabs, and four weeks after the single shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.  So given that France specifically does not recognize vaccines that are (only) approved by the WHO, and also does not specifically name Sinovac, then presumably a person vaccinated with Sinovac might not be able to enter France (without an urgent need/without undergoing quarantine), even if they might be able to enter Greece or Spain.  Or as another example:  &gt; However, fully vaccinated passengers with valid vaccination certificates are entirely exempt, no matter the color code of the country they come from. **Cyprus accepts all vaccines approved for use in the EU as well as the Sputnik V and Sinopharm shots**.  This means that Sino**vac** specifically would not count for Cyprus, even if Sino**pharm** does.  If you actually were going to plan a trip to Europe, and you were vaccinated with Sinovac (or Sinopharm, as in the case of the San Juan), you'd basically have to check on a per-country basis.

You choose to be homeless. That is your fault. You failed. How does one not have friends or family? Sounds like you have anti-societal problems.

They don't seem to have as much drugs or alcohol or smoking or random sex or vulgarity as much as America. I hate the USA because everyone I meet does ""Weed"", gets drunk and high, or smokes, takes pride in having sex with random people, have immense ego and entitlement, employees give the worst and unprofessional experience,band I just don't like people in the USA.  You know nothing about the PHILIPPINES probably other than Filipinas who will love you long time. Stop reading those SEX PAT blogs.   DRUGS are prevalent in the PHILIPPINES also and nothing more different than the States. If you tried to make some minimal effort, you can read about all the drug-related news.

But, then there is already an alliance of at least three airlines with basically a vaccine passport in use today. Generally, I'm for them if they encourage vaccination and reduce the spread of the virus. I'm a bit concerned about Sinovac being on the list or not. We took the vaccine available for our safety and towards the community goal of reaching herd immunity, now will we be discriminated against for not being choosy. There are already countries backing up their Chinese vaccines with a third Pfizer shot, and even Pfizer is preparing a 3rd shot booster because of the variants. I hope that the Philippines recognizes this need earlier rather than later and start rolling out third shots to those in the high priority groups with Sinovac. They were in those groups specifically because of their high risk, and the Indian/delta variant has proven that Sinovac is much less effective against it.",Philippines,t5_2qjov,/r/Philippines/comments/o50ss8/do_you_agree_on_having_vaccine_passports/h2mlwk2/

42,2,1623272819,"OFWs are victims. My fiance used to be one. The agency you sign on with holds your passport so you can't change your mind, and I think you have to pay them back for connecting you with an assignment. Once you're overseas, your boss will hold onto the passport so you can't leave. You work 6 days a week and would be lucky if you are able to use the phone, step outside to experience snow, or even go to church.  OFWs in the middle east have less rights. Muslim families will be hard on you and try to get you to switch religions in exchange for them to be nicer to you. They may try to rape you, so you have to look as unattractive as possible.  Unfortunately being an OFW is one of the few ways to make enough salary to support a family. The Philippines is a major producer of manpower for other countries. The OFW industry is strong. I remember one time I was flying out overseas for vacation, and a long line of pinays sat in a straight line at the airport. They all looked scared and sad, and were obviously headed for an OFW assignment.  What is worse than having one OFW in the family is having two OFWs. I know one little girl that doesn't want to stay with her mom or dad when they come back from the Philippines. She clings onto the friend that her parents left her with, and she can't sleep without the parents' friend.  But even though OFWs are victims, they are still heroes too. They sacrifice being with their families and agree to the abuse they receive overseas just so that their children could survive. If the OFWs didn't go abroad, perhaps their families would be living in the street searching for scraps of food in the trash.  My fiance and child are in the Philippines, but they can't come abroad to live with me because of the pandemic (there's no vaccine for young kids, and adults headed here have been getting infected on the airplanes). We may have been separated for over a year, and in a way I feel like an OFW trapped overseas. But instead of quitting my job and moving to them, I work and live abroad alone so that I can provide a roof over their heads and food for their stomach. I would rather sacrifice my wants and desires if it means my child is healthy and taken care of. I missed his first steps. I missed his first words. I missed his first time eating solid food. The last time I saw him he couldn't roll and I could hold him in one arm, but now he's probably a third of my height.
