You can download an aurora tracker on your phone, it will give you some idea. Tromsø is a good starting point (and it has a nice planetarium!), but you might want to go outside of town to avoid light pollution. I saw the aurora from the deck of ""Hurtigruten"" about one day south from Tromsø.  Some words of warning: In summer, the midnight sun will be up - no night means no aurora. Also, not every day has auroras, and if it's cloudy, you can't see it from the ground anyways. This means it's very difficult to plan. You need to be at the right place at the right time - a fair bit of luck.  Visiting the fjords: Yes, the fjords are open. Your idea of using Bergen as a starting point is sound, from there you can take a train to Voss (mountain/snow - great for skiing and hiking), or take a bus/boat to the fjords up or down the coast. And Bergen is nice in itself. However, Norway often has very bad weather, especially in winter. We just had a hurricane, and there have been avalanche-warnings... Do ask the locals on what's safe, what to wear etc: Nature in Norway kills a handful of tourists every year - don't add to the statistics.  As for culture, Norwegians are not very sophisticated.

11,11,0.0,1632725201.0,"&gt;Ok so you are for segregation then, because some people cant medically get it and would not be able to go to certain places  Why is this always the argument you people turn to?  In the event of people being medically unable to have the vaccine, they would be qualified for this magical, mystical thing called a 'medical exemption'. That would mean that, yes, they wouldn't qualify for a vaccine passport that said they were vaccinated. But what's to stop the healthcare system issuing a vaccine passport that says ""medically exempt"" on it? So, they haven't been vaccinated, because they can't be, but their rights must be unimpeded because it's not actually their fault, so they get the passport anyway. I'll tell you what's stopping them - absolutely bugger all, and that's likely going to be what they do.   The only thing you're likely to find at this point is people who are, for whatever reason, medically exempt from the vaccine *may* be barred from certain job positions, since they pose a potential health risk. But funnily enough, that's already the case. People with certain conditions can't become pilots or lorry drivers. People on certain medications can't operate heavy machinery. It *already* happens. It's nothing new.  It's a really fucking *simple* concept, you know.  If someone is actually medically exempt (declared such by a real doctor), then the system has to accommodate them. Besides, most European countries aren't doing the 'no vaccine pass, no entry' thing. They'll still let you into wherever you need the passport for if you provide a negative COVID test from within 48 hours. So even for people who are *wilfully* unvaccinated, there's no 'segregation'.

On December 21, the EU [adopted rules](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_6837) requiring that member states invalidate EU COVID passes 270 days after the last vaccination. This left me in the precarious position of my French COVID pass expiring two days before my flight!  The mechanism by which this works is the COVID pass *apps* expiring the certificate, because the certificates themselves do not have expiration dates encoded into them. This potentially means that you could screenshot or print your COVID pass QR code, present that without the app, and all would be fine. However, there is reason to believe that scanners also do this 270-day calculation and will notify that a COVID pass has expired as the date of the last vaccination is encoded into the QR code. Member states do not need to comply with this directive until February 1st, but nothing stops them from doing it sooner. France has done it already.

To rectify my situation, I followed the Swiss COVID application procedure a second time with my updated CDC card reflecting that I received a booster shot. They once again issued me a second certificate within 12 hours, this one reflecting my 3/3 shots, and I was able to scan this into the French app again and receive another EU COVID pass that should last longer. The French pass only becomes ""official"" 7 days after the date you received your last vaccine. Similarly, my Swiss COVID pass is now valid for a year whereas my un-boostered Swiss pass was valid only for 6 months.  Hope this helps someone.

74,41,0.0,1625078011.0,"Copied straight from a Facebook group I'm in (think this is the currently the only available way):  How to get your foreign vaccination approved in Norway  Many group members have contacted me asking how they can get their foreign vaccination approved in Norway.    Firstly, you need to be resident in Norway, alternatively a Norwegian citizen in order for your vaccination to be approved in Norway.  If you are coming to the country as a student or you have landed yourself employment in the country, you can register your vaccination in Norway before your arrival.   In order to register your vaccination in Norway you must have a Norwegian ID number (11 digits) or a D-number.  A D-number is a quick temporary ID you receive after you have arrived in the country.  If you do not have an ID or D number you will need to wait until you have come to Norway to register your vaccination.  You must have been vaccinated with an EMA (European Medicines Agency) approved vaccine in order for your vaccination to be approved in Norway (see my previous post).  If you have had an EMA vaccine this is what you do: You contact your assigned doctor (GP/fastlege) and tell him/her that you want to set up a video session (if you are outside the country) or an appointment (if you are inside the country) to register your vaccination in the Norwegian vaccination register.    If you do not have an assigned doctor, you can contact any private practising doctor at a private clinic in the country, or a municipal health service, or a private health institution.  These are all authorised to see you through the registration process.  If you are outside the country only a video consultation is possible because the doctor must see your vaccination certificate from the country concerned.  Once the doctor has written down all your details, seen your proof of registration and noted when you were vaccinated, where you were vaccinated, and with what you were vaccinated, the doctor will send all this information to the Norwegian vaccine register. Note - all doctor consultations will be paid for in full by the patient.  The Norwegian Health system neither subsidises nor pays for this prosess.  It is you who must pay the whole amount.  Once your vaccination has been approved, you will be able to access your green vaccination certifcate through HelseNorge.no.  If you do not have access to HelseNorge.no then;  a) a friend can do this for you on HelseNorge or   b) you can order a paper copy of your vaccine certifcate.

Maybe they’re available in England too? I’d also recommend, depending on what transport you’re planning to use, to switch to a fresh mask after a few hours of being exposed to a lot of people.   Definitely read up on the entry rules. Prepare for some extra time in case they’re still doing testing on entry at the airport.

In the event of people being medically unable to have the vaccine, they would be qualified for this magical, mystical thing called a 'medical exemption'. That would mean that, yes, they wouldn't qualify for a vaccine passport that said they were vaccinated. But what's to stop the healthcare system issuing a vaccine passport that says ""medically exempt"" on it? So, they haven't been vaccinated, because they can't be, but their rights must be unimpeded because it's not actually their fault, so they get the passport anyway. I'll tell you what's stopping them - absolutely bugger all, and that's likely going to be what they do.   The only thing you're likely to find at this point is people who are, for whatever reason, medically exempt from the vaccine *may* be barred from certain job positions, since they pose a potential health risk. But funnily enough, that's already the case. People with certain conditions can't become pilots or lorry drivers. People on certain medications can't operate heavy machinery. It *already* happens. It's nothing new.  It's a really fucking *simple* concept, you know.  If someone is actually medically exempt (declared such by a real doctor), then the system has to accommodate them. Besides, most European countries aren't doing the 'no vaccine pass, no entry' thing. They'll still let you into wherever you need the passport for if you provide a negative COVID test from within 48 hours. So even for people who are *wilfully* unvaccinated, there's no 'segregation'.
