18,0,1639604000,"‘Germany is an immigration country’: Scholz sets out future vision Chancellor Olaf Scholz set out his vision for Germany under the coalition government, underlining the need for transformation when it comes to the climate, modernisation, immigration and integration.  Scholz held the floor in the Bundestag on Wednesday in a two-hour speech in which he set out the new government’s plans for the coming four years.   The lengthy speech – which is a traditional fixture for incoming German governments – was his first address since he became the ninth chancellor of Germany last week, taking over from Angela Merkel who was in office for 16 years.   Touching on overarching themes of respect, solidarity and support for everyone in the country, Scholz showed his Social Democratic colours throughout.   But he also hammered the home the fact that things were going to change in the coming years. He talked about a transformation in the way businesses and people go about their lives as the country aims to do as much as possible to protect the climate.   Scholz also called for solidarity and for people to get vaccinated to combat the Covid pandemic.  READ ALSO: Germany will ‘defend itself against anti-vaxxers’, says Scholz  Here’s a look at some of the points Scholz touched on in his wide-ranging speech.  Immigration and citizenship  As The Local has been reporting, the new German coalition government is planning an overhaul of the immigration system and citizenship processes.  We’ve been looking at this theme in detail because it affects to so many of our readers – most of whom are foreigners in Germany themselves.   “Germany is an immigration country,” said Scholz as he addressed the Bundestag. “It’s high time we understand ourselves. Therefore it’s high time we make it easier to become a German citizen.”  “It is only on this basis that we can make full integration and political participation possible.”  (article continues below)  See also on The Local:  Scholz said the new German government plans to make citizenship possible after five years in Germany – reducing it from the current eight years.  The coalition plans also state that this could be reduced to three years in the case of special integration achievements.  There are also plans to relax the current strict rules on holding more than one citizenship. This would be beneficial for non-EU nationals who – on the whole – are not granted more than one passport if they apply to be naturalised in Germany.   “We’re going to make multiple citizenship possible, which is in keeping with many people in this country,” said Scholz, adding that it will allow people to hold the citizenship of their country of origin as well as German citizenship.

Photo: picture alliance/dpa | Kay Nietfeld Scholz said the coalition planned to enact a new immigration law. The coalition has said there are plans to introduce a points-based system of immigration to attract more skilled workers.  The new government also wants to streamline processes.   “It will be easier for immigrants to find jobs in Germany,” said Scholz in the Bundestag. “Educational qualifications from people coming from abroad should be recognised more easily.”  Climate, modernisation and business  In the fight to slow down climate change, Scholz told people in Germany that there would be far-reaching changes.   The phase-out of fossil fuels must be accelerated, he said. By 2030, 80 percent of electricity demand is to come from renewable sources. “This means that the biggest transformation of our industry and economy in at least 100 years lies ahead of us,” said the Chancellor.  “The prosperity of our country depends on our ability to build the infrastructures for the climate-neutral age.”  In general, he said, the coming years would be about modernising and investing in many areas – from charging stations and wind farms, to digitalisation and administration.  There is no point in “saving against the crisis”, said Scholz underlining the need to invest in the changes the country needs.  READ ALSO: German cabinet agrees €60 billion climate investment plan  He talked of a “new era” in Germany’s digital path.  “Germany has to come back to the top of the league in terms of digital infrastructure,” said Scholz. “And for that reason we will invest in future technologies.”  On the subject of financing, Scholz said that spending would be put to the test and there would be a crack down on tax evasion.   Scholz, however, did attribute a big role to the economy and promised “super write-offs” in 2022 and 2023 for investments in climate protection and digitalisation.  Innovative companies are also to receive further tax benefits, and the development bank KfW is to play an even stronger role, Scholz said – perhaps an influence from his coalition teammates, the business-friendly Free Democrats.  Scholz said the government hopes to make Germany the leading European location for startups.  Equality, respect and wages  Scholz underlined the need for equality in society, touching on class and gender differences.   He said the minimum wage hike would be an important step for this.

Then hopefully you’re invited down to get that and can then make sure your application is being worked on in person.   Whether or not you can go down to the Ausländeramt without an appointment depends on the local rules. Here in Cologne for example they don’t allow anyone to even enter the grounds without an appointment (Covid rules).

In principle, the following are allowed to enter the country  German nationals and their family members of the nuclear family (spouse, unmarried minor children, parents of minor children). EU citizens and citizens of Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Norway and Iceland and their family members of the nuclear family (spouse, unmarried minor children, parents of minor children) Third-country nationals with an existing long-term right of residence in an EU or Schengen state and their family members of the nuclear family, provided that the passport and visa regulations are fulfilled. In addition, entry is permitted to:  Persons resident in third countries such as the United Kingdom may only enter Germany if they perform an important function, their journey is imperative (see on this ""When is there an imperative need to enter?"") or if they are fully vaccinated (see on this ""What applies to fully vaccinated persons?""). A person is resident in a state if he or she is either domiciled or habitually resident there. Residence is established in particular if the last 6 months have been spent there.*   For entries of family members, see also ""What special features apply to the entry of family members from third countries"".  Travellers must present a negative Covid-19 test, proof of genesis or proof of vaccination before entry. A maximum of 48 hours (PCR test 72 hours) may have elapsed between test collection and entry.

Travellers with a carrier (aeroplane, bus, train) must already present the negative Covid-19 test or proof of vaccination before departure/departure.  *The decision as to which documents are accepted as sufficient to prove residence is a decision of the Federal Police.

The parents, as Americans, are not allowed to mail in the registration paperwork and are not allowed to make an appointment because appointments were not allowed during this time period.   A few weeks later, American parents are transferred to Leipzig for work. Baby is still not registered with the birth office. Parents are then called back to the US of A because work contracts were bought out and are given two weeks to get paperwork and get on an airplane.   Parents FINALLY are able to make an appointment to get baby recognized as being born and make the long journey by train from Leipzig to Stuttgart. Oh, wait, mother’s divorce was finalized while mom was pregnant. They had been separated for 10 years and mother had not spoken to her ex-husband since then (American military benefits for being married, long story). This ex-husband is the ONLY MAN that could be recognized as the father and the only way to register baby is with his signature. He’s living in the USA somewhere unknown and mother is told he MUST fly to Germany to sign a piece of paper saying he is not the father.   After some crying, office girl lets mother sign the paper and we will just ignore that the baby has a father. Immaculate conception or some such other. But, baby must have ex-husbands name on the paper. Whatever. We need the piece of paper. She is able to get it to us the next day.   Cue requirement to take an overnight train to Berlin to go to the American consulate to get a passport. We’re down to having three days to leave the country.

Was told then not to worry. Mother just needs to fill out a form online stating this and submit it to the consulate. Done and done. Passport achieved. Oh, wait. Mother has to go to an office in Berlin to state they wouldn’t come back to Germany without the recognized father of the baby. Done.

The one person I know for sure who's traveled did so before the idea of proof of vaccination being a ""major thing"", and so still had to get a negative PCR test and all that.  &gt; The documents they were given were accepted at the border when they returned. So I am hoping that the CDC card will be good enough once the borders are open again.  Realistically, with such disparate vaccination systems and how people got jabbed and the massive push to get people vaccinated and ""we'll worry about the finer details later,"" toting around paper and sending in proof of vaccinations from other countries will wind up being a thing that happens.",germany,t5_2qi4z,/r/germany/comments/ns7ejx/entering_germany_with_proof_of_covid_immunization/h0mvcbs/
71,0,1621241178,"Doctors in Germany can prescribe the vaccine just like any other medicine. So of course every doctor is free to give you a second shot and by the time your second shot is necessary, the vaccine supply in Germany should be sufficient that you should have no problem getting this shot.  If this half Canadian, half German vaccination can be recognised for some sort of official vaccination passport is a different question. But frankly I wouldn't worry about that. Once infection numbers are low enough, everything will be opened up for everyone anyways and vaccination status won't matter any more. It will probably only be important for a short transition period, that might already be over before you get your second shot anyways.  And in any case: get vaccinated if you can. Don't worry about the bureaucracy, that will surely work itself out somehow. Just make sure you get protected as soon as you can. Not doing that would be mad. Infection numbers are currently still high (albeit falling) and you don't want to risk catching covid because you passed on that shot in Canada, do you?",germany,t5_2qi4z,/r/germany/comments/neacku/first_vaccine_dose_abroad/gyfa3jh/
72,0,1620649954,"Im a German Australian dual citizen that migrated here to Germany 2 years ago for work. I had never worked or lived here permanently up until that time, however my family is German and lives in Germany - it was just my father who migrated to Australia ( lol obviously ) and i thought i had it sorted (fluent/passport/connections etc ) before i got here. If you are brave to read on and do not take this personally, please read on...   Nope. Nooooo i was wrong! WRONG!   **BTW-This is a** ***""general observation"",*** **there are lots who are not like this but i am struggling to find them. My first year here in Germany was hell on Earth for the below reasons. To put in context, i inadvertently moved to one of the most racist towns in Niedersachsen and just happened by a stroke of bad luck to live ontop of an AfD psycho woman...**  I found ""Germans"" to be passive aggressive, rude, obstructionist, cold, inappropriately opinionated, always blaming others for their mistakes or faults and always trying to find a ""weaker"" person to take out all their insecurities on. Yet at the same time, being more ""woke"" and self righteous than they deserve credit for...and then ramming it down everyone elses throat ( esp if you are foreign ). It was so bad in the first year that i almost went back to Oz!  Despite my fluent language skills, education and experience and the fact that i was INVITED by a German multinational company to work for them, i am treated like an uneducated, dumb idiot who is always trying to ""cheat"" the ""real Germans"" out of &lt;insert random topic here&gt;. Or the cause of &lt;insert recycling/parking/noise complaint here&gt;, despite being a quiet and boring person and capable of following German instructions  (im 42 for crying out loud! )  Allegedly i am always ""lying"" if there is not a German born person with me to verify ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING i say, even when they cannot speak English and have no idea what i need or  even if they need to be there. Which mostly, they dont!! For example, I am a cancer survivor from about 5 years ago, the Hausartzt wanted my partner to verify this, despite us only being together and knowing each other 2 years and him never having left Germany or able to speak English...oooookay. Because my English medical documents were allegedly ""not enough"", they need my German plumber boyfriend to confirm.  I have a German partner (the plumber) who claims to not know one word of English (no problem-o!) but still uses my ""foreignness"" to blame or accuse me of something as a course of a ""misunderstanding"" to explain his deliberately rude, manipulative and sometimes embarrassing behavior  ( dont even get me started on his ""elite"", toxic, racist family ).  I noticed Germans do not like fresh fruit or vegetables unless it is vacuum packed in glad wrap but then lecture and dictate to everyone about saving the environment and wastage.  I noticed lately that i am being ""flight shamed"" as i would like to visit my father who refuses t come back to Germany, in Melbourne - when the border reopens. I am ""killing the environment"" by needing to catch a plane and i should be ""ashamed"".  I noticed Germans cannot handle change. At all. Even down to catching COVID because they NEED to go on that Austrian ski holiday regardless of pandemic, war, famine... global warming...  My Super-German Plumber Partner gets upset when i wear ""foreign clothes""..that means jeans, a t shirt and little thongs with butterflies or something that is normal on the beach in Oz...on the Ostsee...nope my clothes are ""not normal and i should go and change before he gets embarrassed and wear some real German woman clothes, so a militant mountain hiking pants with some angry masculine button up shirt that is too tight with very very small breast implants, a deep voice, a cigarette hanging out of mouth and dragging her kids with Kindergeld and husband by his balls to get an ice cream because she says so..."".  I noticed that Germans cannot handle anyone with a difference of opinion (esp Politics ) so if there is ANY opinion from me, i am labelled a Nazi and automatically voting for AfD ( i am Jewish too, unbelievable ).  Australia is a multicultural country in its true-est form,(compared to anything i have seen in Europe ), so i find the constant mentions of my foreign background in the negative absolutely shocking ( i was even blamed for the spread COVID 19 by my work colleague because she saw that Australia was in ""Asia"" and then made 1 +1 = 27.5 )  Germans do NOT get irony or black humour. ""punkt"". However i was happily proven wrong recently by a new colleague who is just the funniest guy ive ever met, AND he is full German and married to a Brazilian because he takes issue with German women and some behavioural ""norms"" that are frankly unacceptable to most people.   In saying all of this ( sorry if you are still reading this ) i have met lovely Germans to, and after a bit of ""argey bargie"" , are totally fine and okay...which seems to be necessary to establish to the German person that not only can i speak the language, i can also....READ!!!! I DONT FEEL I SHOULD HAVE TO ARGIE BARGIE WITH ANYONE... ARRRRGHHHHH!  I miss Oz and fresh fruit and veggies. I miss being able to cook Thai green curry and not have people in my house making vomiting sounds or comment on some aspect of it being foreign food and thus, inedible as i do not ""Germanize"" it. I miss being Jewish and not have people find that insulting or a dig at German war history. I miss thongs. I miss swimming without having my body critiqued by a lipo-sucked, itty bitty German tittied middle aged demented blonde Heidi reject with a flat wrinkly arse and unwanted inappropriate opinion on feminine ideals...   I miss just walking into a shop/office/situation where i did NOT have to give a lengthy family history of why i have a German name and not being a ""real German"".  However, it IS very cool to find cups and pens and stuff with my name printed on it, as my name doesnt exist in the Aussie lingo bandwidth. Which is totally okay...but..
