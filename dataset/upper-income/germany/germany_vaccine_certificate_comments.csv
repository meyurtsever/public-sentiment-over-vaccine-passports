We already recommend anyone who got the Janssen vaccine to get another mRNA jab within four weeks. I assume we will make that mandatory soon.

Therefore the checking apps are not sure what's the case and show ""not valid"". Other apps, like the CWA, which could find out the difference if you have all your certificates imported therefore also show them as invalid.  Your advice is good practical advice for all those affected by this. Just show your first certificate until 14 days after the booster, because the people who check the certificates will go by what the checking app says (if they don't have QR readers built into their eyes, like most servers seem to have nowadays).

On the phone they asked us if we were vaccinated, and we said we were.  But when we got there, and the place was packed, nobody checked. A harrassed server waved us vaguely in the direction of our table. This place, by the way, has two rooms, a balcony, and a large patio.  It took *ages* before our order was taken, and more *ages* before our food arrived.  Well, here's why all of these things happened: they were seriously short-staffed. We got talking to the owner: he was happy that at last he could re-open properly, and that at last he could hope to make a little money in the last few months of the year. But he couldn't afford to pay enough servers (because, you know, the pandemic has hit his business hard), and one of his regular staff was off sick, so there was a grand total of three people, including himself, working the entire restaurant. He simply couldn't afford to have somebody on the door with a non-existant scanner (not every business has them, what a surprise) checking every single person's vaccine certificate and ID card. As we arrived they were closing the patio and balcony, but were still rushed off their feet.  Basically, in this case, the response from the manager when we talked to him was: ""Yes, but how?"" And: ""Everybody wants to work from home and eat out now, but nobody can tell me where I'm supposed to get the staff.""  It's hard to know what to do in these circumstances. We're not going back there until the whole pandemic thing is over.

106,0,1628792201,"&gt; How much time would that be then?  Most likely months and up to a year. We are not talking about an extreme minority of ideologues that will never change their minds.   &gt; Anyway, I don't give a fuck what people are or aren't thinking or what their intentions might be.   You may think like that, of course, but that's not how you design policy. You cannot manage people without their consent for long, eventually they will rise up and turn against you, after being radicalised by extremists. There's a reason we prefer pluralistic democratic systems of government. Broad participation and a sense of your concerns being considered brings more political stability.   Germany has a vaccination rate of around 65%. Let's round that to 70% for those who are still waiting for their second appointment date to come, like yours truly. The remaining 30% are not anti-vaxxers. At worst, only the remaining 5% is. You should be wanting to win that 25% over, instead of gifting them to the 5% of extremists. You may be fed up with their indecisiveness, but it will be worse for everyone if due to social pressure they are convinced that the extremists were right and that the government is indeed out to get them.   &gt; Was the person given plenty of opportunity to act? Obviously yes, even now. It's not like you have to start paying for tests tomorrow.  They were not given understanding. Their fears have been ridiculed, and their concerns caused by bad science communication by politicians (like the horrible smear campaign against the AstraZeneca vaccine) has not allowed them to act. And while there have been attempts to make up for the mostly bad science communication, tribalism has strongly taken hold. Vaccinated people are cutting off unvaccinated friends, and vice-versa. People either bribe for fake vaccine certificates, or get their vaccination done in secret, all to avoid social stigma and expulsion of their group. This is a public health disaster, especially when it comes to fake vaccine certificates (it's a social cohesion disaster for the inverse case).   &gt;  I'll reserve that for people actually suffering, be it from falling ill, from loosing loved ones or from being driven into utter exhaustion. Since all of that can be prevented or at the very least significantly reduced by vaccination, empathy is actually a pretty good reason to get vaccinated. Essentially, you're calling for more empathy for people who are demonstrating a lack thereof. Just no.   So long as you continue excluding the middle, we won't get far. I am not recommending that you to empathise with extremists.  &gt; That would be the case, if there's any harm done. It isn't though, when the thing you need to do to avoid unwanted costs is entirely to your benefit.   Modern science and medicine learned for mistakes of the past and values informed consent extremely highly. Our domestic and international legal systems also reflect our moral values. The legality of making those who cannot afford the less invasive medical practice that serves the same purpose as the more invasive medical practice spend a disproportionate amount of their income in order to preserve their right to choose doesn't look like it will hold up in courts, but it remains to be seen. The ethical case is pretty clear cut though.   &gt; So what? Many vaccines only offer temporary protection, that's entirely par for the course. I simply fail to see any argument there. ""Eventually I'll drown anyway"" isn't a valid argument against learning to swim.   That is only addressed towards the people who advocate for exceptions for the vaccinated. If you don't advocate for that, and it seems like you don't, then disregard it.   &gt; d like to point out, that this country has had mandated vaccinations in the past and with the blessing of the BVG.   Mandatory vaccinations have their place, including with regards to SARS-CoV-2. Medical necessity and legal proportionality must be applied though. The issue is indirect *universal* vaccination, which is a radical concept for comparable diseases.  &gt;  If the comparatively soft approach of making life a little more expensive and inconvenient for the terminally stubborn doesn't produce the desired results, I'd have zero troubles with going down that road again.  Excluding the middle again. I think we won't be able to meet halfway in this argument if you refuse to accept that most people who aren't vaccinated yet aren't ideologues.   &gt;  How is anything conditional upon anybody's level of wealth, when the vaccine is entirely free?  The ability to *make* the choice to consent to the vaccine is conditional to your wealth. If you make 3000 EUR per month and you don't want to get vaccinated, then the ~240 EUR per month for a low estimate of 2 tests per week is an amount of money that sure, you would miss, but you could afford for as long as you wish to. If you are someone like me, who makes 1000 EUR per month, 240 EUR is almost the money I have left after paying my fixed expenses. If I wasn't sure I want to be vaccinated, I would be forced to take it without being able to offer informed consent (or seek a way to get a fake certificate for an one-off cost and/or come into contact with large groups of people in ways that bypass status verification and contact tracing).   By taking away the free tests for the undecided, you create those two classes: those who can afford them continue to be tested. Those who can't afford them either put them and everyone at risk by going underground, or have their bodily integrity violated because of their status as low-earners.   &gt; If you're a bus driver and refuse to do something about your failing eyesight, it's entirely on you that your choices provide your employer with grounds for termination. How's that different to somebody whose work includes close contact with the vulnerable refusing to get vaccinated?   See above for specific professions and mandatory vaccinations. Yes, we can make a solid case for mandatory vaccinations in medical environments, care homes, and probably in schools too. That is exactly because we know that in those environments the risk is extremely high and that runaway chains of infection were common and disastrous, and other measures proved ineffective. On the other hand, it is utterly disproportional to fire BVG drivers if they don't get vaccinated. Closing the front door of the buses and making inspectors wear FFP2 masks proved more than enough to make their role in spreading the virus negligible.   To use your example, when you are a bus driver with failing eyesight, your employer has no moral or legal right to force you to undergo a more invasive procedure like laser surgery, if wearing glasses or contact lenses (less invasive procedures) are more than enough to correct your vision to normal.",germany,t5_2qi4z,/r/germany/comments/p2l91g/germany_to_stop_paying_for_virus_tests_for_people/h8on7jp/
