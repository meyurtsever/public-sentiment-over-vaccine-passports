Vaccinated people are just a likely to get COVID and are barely less likely to transmit it. The benefit of the vaccine is to keep you out of the hospital and so the passport merely works as an incentive to get hesitant people vaccinated. No one is hesitant anymore, if you’re still unvaxxed you aren’t going to be swayed by the continuation of the passport. And removing the passport doesn’t unvaccinate people.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/sk3mlm/kenney_to_announce_next_week_the_date_alberta/hvkaval/

Look at whats going on with the trucking convoy that has costed business millions in lost revenue, thats people not being able to work because someone elses freedoms are more important. Imagine if we validate all those people, that is a toxic situation ripe for abuse.  Let me ask the people who still have the audacity to question mandates, why do you think your better than the rest of us that understand the dangers and concequences of covid and want to work together to slow it down?  Lets ignore stupid absolutes, because saying that 100% vaccination is impossible is redundant and obvious when kids below 5 cant even get vaccines. Lets also ignore the loss of business since the freedom convoys destructiom of business revenue ironically cancells all of that out.. lets lay out the fundamental motivations  people that want the passport mandate to work want to go back to normal, and want to feel peotected from covid.  what do people that dont want the covid mandate want? to continue to live their life in fear? to wander across covid riddeled society fending for themselves? do they want to force businesses open on their terms  and destroy businesses when its not on their terms? what exactly is the point of the movement? the demand for business wont dissapear because people wont dissapear, businesses with low tolerances will fail, if it was really about the businesses why park outside and block them and use your train horns for 6 days?  ill tell you why, its not about covid, or freedoms, its an excuse to act out a fantasy where your some fringe opressed group, because that scenario is the only one that allows their fantasy to *make sense*. The vaccine mandate isnt the enemy because its bad, its the enemy out *of necessity to sustain the illusion* , surely if a business would start doing the vaccine requirements privately, the whole movement will pivot without question.  All and all these people are beyond mentally ill, they have become mentally captured by a radial idea that they might very well not be in control of.

2,2,1643996579,"&gt;  A lot of the decisions can be judged with hindsight, but it was an ever evolving situation with too many unknowns, and it was hard to make the right choices all of the time.  Except our so called 'experts' have been wrong and/or exaggerated nearly everything they've said. With Omicron, South Africa was already showing signs that that variant wasn't very dangerous and they had already peaked with cases if not nearly so and yet despite that data when cases started to rise here, they panicked and complete threw out the vaccine passport program anyways and pretty much admitted that they had little confidence that a nearly 90% vaccinated Ontarian population was enough to protect against Omicron and not require reintroduction of restrictions.  In otherwards the people who kept saying they would 'follow the science and data' didn't follow the science and data that they saw in other parts of the world.   &gt; We would need to experience the alternative reality where nothing was done to evaluate if it was just right or completely over the top.   Or maybe simply see what was happening in parts of the rest of the world and perhaps take that into consideration rather than making massive blanket restrictions that affected far too many people with far too little benefit.  Japan is that 'alternate reality' where a 1st world nation implemented minimal restrictions on its population and achieved massively better results while causing much less damage and destruction to their country and their people. Why ignore such a successful example that has been going on for 2 years now instead of saying, 'hey maybe we should give that a try'?  &gt; Other countries experienced much higher death tolls and disruption. So yeah, it sucked, mistakes were made, but maybe, just maybe, it could have been much worse.  Most poor African nations with much worse medical systems suffered much less than most western countries with vastly better medical systems. And I bet most African people weren't fanatical in following restrictions placed on them if they had many at all.  As I said, we could've largely achieved the same results by simply protecting the elderly and sick from the beginning of the pandemic and perhaps preventing thousands of deaths back then. And no one wants to include all the countless people who died because they needed treatment for non-covid issues and couldn't get it because everything was directed towards covid patients. No one wants to include all the other damages that were caused to people and their livelihoods because its all non-covid so who cares?  No one wants to admit the sad fact that the government's utter fanaticism in fighting covid did far more harm than than good.

Kenney says Alberta’s high vaccination rate coupled with declining pressure on hospitals make it feasible to end the vaccine passport soon.  A week ago, Kenney said the passport could be eliminated by the end of March.  But since then Kenney has come under increasing pressure from members of his own United Conservative caucus to end the passport while also dealing with vaccine mandate protests by truckers and supporters who have created chaos and traffic tie-ups at Alberta’s main U.S. border checkpoint.  The truckers and some members of Kenney’s caucus say the passport has served its purpose, unfairly infringes on individual rights, and must be cancelled.

The vaccines were benefiting the elderly and the sick the most and not the majority of the rest of the population that were largely at least decently healthy and its always been that way. We're over 3 million confirmed covid cases after 2 years now and only 4% have ever been in hospital for the virus and well over half those patients were 60 years and older. And considering there's 9.8 MILLION people over the age of 60, even in that most vulnerable and at risk demographic they were barely affected by the virus.   &gt; When omicron arrived it infected the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike, though long term it proved the vaccine still provided notable reductions in symptoms.   Again the vaccines were suppose to handle situations like these where it was believed that getting your two shots would be enough to keep society open, especially with the passport where vaxxed were only hanging out with other vaxxed people making things even more safe.  But of course that didn't happen which is why the narrative now became 'it will reduce symptoms to be less severe' which did happen, but you can't even any longer say that it significantly reduced the virus spread when the majority of people had gotten their shots and the number of infections still went up dramatically.  &gt; And not because of the convoy, this was always going to happen, just a matter of when the circumstances would allow it since there was never a conspiracy to steal everyone's freedoms.  Edit: As far as vaccine requirements: they're not anything new, and weren't controversial until now. And even that's being generous since most people don't have issue with requirements like vaccines for some occupations or in order to travel internationally.  I don't know how you can say coercing people with extreme measures to get vaccinated isn't taking away one's freedom of personal choice all in the name of protecting society from a virus that can barely kill the most sick and elderly in our nation let alone more healthier and younger people.   Japan got it right. At the beginning of the pandemic when the severity of the virus was unknown, they too shutdown much of their nation for a few weeks. HOWEVER they evaluated the situation and the data and decided that the virus wasn't nearly as dangerous as initially thought and then they made the sane, rational decision of reopening their country almost fully and with few restrictions on their people.   2 years running and they've still been right all along while countries like Canada who had access to the same data as the Japanese, but decided to continue to double down on their double downs in an effort to eradicate covid rather than managing and living with it. Only now in the last week or two have our most fearmongering experts like Peter Juni have finally started saying that we should live with the virus.   Only 2 years too late after they caused so much destruction on our nation and our people and with their neverending fear campaign being so effective, now a certain amount of people may never be able to get back to living normally because they've been brainwashed so thoroughly as to how dangerous covid is and can't go back.  And with regards to vaccine requirements maybe that would've made sense if covid was much more dangerous than it really is or if the vaccines we have now were super effective in preventing someone from getting the virus and/or spreading it. In the end the virus was never as dangerous as it was always made out to be and the vaccines were never as effective as we had hoped and putting in all these restrictions and pretty much forcing people to get vaccinated was completely unnecessary and WRONG. We should've all stood up against this long ago and instead the majority laid down and took everything the government forced upon us without so much as a peep.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/sgnqgq/holding_a_mass_temper_tantrum_in_ottawa_disguised/hv14sol/

42,3,1643540492,"&gt;And if these people are afraid of side effects from a vaccine they're going to have a bad time learning about the side effects of actually catching covid.  People ought to be able to choose what ailments they are exposed to. 40% of people are asymptomatic to covid, source: [https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-3012](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M20-3012) . Perhaps a person feels more comfortable that they would be in this 40% group, compared to the vastly higher percentage of people who suffer some ailment from the vaccine. For example, the CDC reports \~77% of people get 'at least one systemic reaction', source: [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/reactogenicity.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/reactogenicity.html)   Therefore, if you wanted to have 0 side effects, you would have a better chance being in that 40% asymptomatic group, rather than the 23% (100-77) group that has so systemic reaction to the vaccines. Like who are you to tell a person they should take the riskier chance thing, but with less maximum risk, than the less riskier thing with more maximum risk? Why not let that person decide that for themselves?  Additionally, just as a cherry on top, I would say that there might be some argument on infection spread (though I'd still prefer people have the option to quarantine themselves) if the vaccines reduce transmission. However, we are actually seeing the exact opposite, both in countries across the world and in this country. In a Danish study, people with 2 doses who received the most recent one 91-150 days ago, actually had **negative effectiveness** in thwarting infection, -76.5% to be exact, so those people were more likely on average to catch covid! Source: [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.20.21267966v2.full.pdf](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.20.21267966v2.full.pdf)   Okay, that's Denmark, but what about Canada? Well, according to recent data, several provinces again show people with 2 doses of the vaccine are actually catching covid more per capita! Source: [https://nationalpost.com/health/omicron-unvaccinated-double-vaccinated-covid-positive](https://nationalpost.com/health/omicron-unvaccinated-double-vaccinated-covid-positive) ""In at least three provinces lately, Canadians who are double-vaccinated have been more likely to test positive for COVID than the unvaccinated"" This is not a case of 'oh there are more vaccinated people', this is PER CAPITA, this is ON AVERAGE! If our goal is to flatten the curve, bring the pandemic to an end, what say you to the double vaccinated who are catching covid at a higher rate in these provinces?  All this shows that, especially on these vaccines, they OUGHT to be treated like the flu vaccine: not mandatory, not needed to go to freaking Walmart for crying out loud, but if you want to get it to protect yourself, then get it, I don't care. But don't force others to! Why is that so hard to ask?  And finally, if you want to make the hospitalization argument (i.e. 'unvaccinated are clogging up the hospitals!'), are you going to put a ban on smoking, since those people are taking unnecessary risk that lands them in the hospital more often? What about obese people, you want to have some government mandate forcing people to be more in shape so they go to the hospital less? Because if you want to talk about who is taking up hospital space, there are a lot more easily preventable comorbidities that people have that we accept in our free society, and in a rich Western country we can afford to invest in our healthcare system, and in fact that might be one of the most important things we invest in. And, finally, if this was about keeping the hospitals open and running properly, why fire unvaccinated healthcare workers, especially since I just showed that double vaccinated people spread relatively similar to unvaccinated, if not more often in some provinces?  &gt;Does getting a passport restrict your freedom?  No, because a passport holder and non-passport holder can still engage in the same activities domestically. Next?  &gt;Does getting a driver's license restrict your freedom?  No, because I know plenty of people who don't have a drivers license, and can still access all the same places as people who do have ID and do the same things, provided they show SOME form of ID (i.e. can still buy liquor if they can prove their identity and age in a different way). Next?  &gt;Does getting a background check restrict your freedom?   Depends on the circumstances but I believe you are referring to private companies doing background checks (i.e. for employee hire). I'd say private corporations can decide who they want to do business with (besides to protected classes, i.e. they can't say 'we aren't going to allow people of this religion'), but that should not be some government mandate like it is at say Walmart. Walmart is forced to adhere to these mandates for all customers for all purchases, since the government decided their store is of some arbitrary size and therefore must enforce vaccine passports. If the corporation wanted to enforce vaccine passports themselves without the government telling them, then that's a different conversation, is that more what you are referring to here?  &gt;I would argue they all do yet we have no problem going through that process. People need to grow up and understand that a functioning society puts up restrictions around certain things for the benefit of society as a whole.  I just showed how all your examples are fundamentally different than the vaccine passports, which are used domestically for entry into basic stores such as Walmart. ""Benefit for society as a whole"" stops at bodily autonomy. Someone could make an argument ""oh you eating unhealthy food/smoking in your house (that you live in alone with no guests ever) all the time is not benefitting our society since you are less productive, less healthy, take up hospital space, etc. and if you would get in shape/stop smoking cigarettes our society would be better as a whole"", but no one thinks we should have government mandates on that because we allow personal autonomy to decide how you want to treat your body",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/sfd629/freedom_convoy_size_exaggerated_by_miscaptioned/huu8cww/

53,6,1643399218,"[Vaccine passports used domestically](https://www.history.com/news/vaccine-passports-smallpox-scar) absolutely have historical precedent going back over a century. There's even an article from 1904 referencing a trade in fake vaccine passports. Aside from that you make good points (and I appreciate excellent conversation - thank you!), so I'm not arguing against you per se. Still, I'd like to discuss some nuances after your post.  \- Canada has had 3M cases of *confirmed* COVID to date (which obviously includes the huge Omicron bump), which is less than 10% of the population. Of course actual cases is going to be larger than the confirmed cases. Even so, I'm not positive everyone will get COVID, or at least not for some time.  \- Virus mutation to a Omicron-esque variant was a reasonable hope given other viruses historically, but not a certainty and with no definite time frame of arrival. You could not responsibly base policy on it at least.  \- Naturally I'll agree that vaccinations don't stop transmission. I don't agree the crux of vax passport argument was ever transmission prevention though. Slowing transmission was part, but the crux was restricting access to high-risk areas to those with protection. Instead of closing them completely we'd be able to re-open them but with the requirement that people needed protection to enter the high-risk areas. If exposed, as was much likelier, the person would have better chances of completely fighting off the disease plus excellent insurance against hospitalization/death.  \- About natural immunity, at the beginning people may have said no one knows how effective natural immunity is and to get vaccinated. Exact numbers weren't available and vaccines have an excellent risk/benefit ratio. The problem with relying on natural immunity is it requires infection with the associated illness and hazards. By last summer at the latest the scientific consensus was natural immunity + vaccinations = the best.  \- I hear good arguments for those people saying COVID is under AND overreported so I have no clue. I've fallen back on using excess deaths as a measure of severity.  I think some of the other points you raise are scientists using the best models available and adjusting their viewpoints as data dictated.

So there's some 300,000 active cases in the entire country......and we're only seeing a few thousand actually serious enough to end up in hospital and ONLY NOW in places like Ontario are they starting to differentiate between people actually in hospital getting treated for the virus versus going to the hospital for other medical issues and simply testing positive.  The point is only a tiny percentage of covid cases become serious enough as to require hospital treatment and for those 60 years and older, despite only making up 15% of confirmed covid cases, they make up 56% of all covid hospital cases and 62% of all ICU covid patients since the beginning of the pandemic.  The point is covid isn't putting tens of thousands of generally healthy people into hospitals and taking up resources even though they make up the vast majority of confirmed covid cases. Its putting the elderly and sick into hospital for covid and even their numbers have declined since getting their vaccinations.  &gt; I expect you'll see things opening up again soon in most provinces since they're over the Omicron hump and Delta's been quiet.

The vaccine passports and having only the vaxxed be allowed to gather with each other at restaurants, bars etc. was supposed to deal with rise in cases like this and yet they had so little belief in the vaccines that they threw out the whole program when Omicron cases kept rising proving that the passport system was all theater to begin with and that the vaxxed were lied to when they were assured that getting your shots and the passport was the key to returning back to normal life.

The goal of the vaccine rollout is mostly to reduce the amount of deaths which has gotten significant results. The second goal is to reduce the spread. Even if your aren't 100% immune, you still have a smaller chance of catching it. Even if there is 30% chance of still catching it while vaccinated, that has a significant impact on the spread. Basically the more people get vaccinated, fewer people will catch it, fewer people will be hospitalized, fewer people die. Herd immunity will result in more deaths and more hospitalizations.

Three multivariate logistic regression models were applied. In all models we evaluated four outcomes: SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic disease, COVID-19-related hospitalization and death. The follow-up period of June 1 to August 14, 2021, when the Delta variant was dominant in Israel.  &gt; **Results:**  &gt; SARS-CoV-2-naïve vaccinees had a 13.06-fold (95% CI, 8.08 to 21.11) increased risk for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant compared to those previously infected, when the first event (infection or vaccination) occurred during January and February of 2021. The increased risk was significant (P&lt;0.001) for symptomatic disease as well. When allowing the infection to occur at any time before vaccination (from March 2020 to February 2021), evidence of waning natural immunity was demonstrated, though SARS-CoV-2 naïve vaccinees had a 5.96-fold (95% CI, 4.85 to 7.33) increased risk for breakthrough infection and a 7.13-fold (95% CI, 5.51 to 9.21) increased risk for symptomatic disease. SARS-CoV-2-naïve vaccinees were also at a greater risk for COVID-19-related-hospitalizations compared to those that were previously infected.  &gt; **Conclusions:**  &gt; This study demonstrated that natural immunity confers longer lasting and stronger protection against infection, symptomatic disease and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2, compared to the BNT162b2 two-dose vaccine-induced immunity.

75,0,1642883565,"As a Chinese-Canadian (I hold a Canadian passport and have been banned from entering China indefinitely due to COVID-19), I have heard of news pieces where Chinese government officials threaten and coerce immigrants to return. This is generally not a good strategy though. If I am in Canada and I know I am a wanted person in China to the point that the Chinese police are harassing me by phone or in person, I would never return. It is better for me to get murdered by Chinese police in Canada, let the local police and RCMP investigate the murder, than for me to return to China and be disappeared forever, even though the murderer will never be brought to justice.  I have been joking with my mother about the opposite problem that she may face: being banned from entering China due to COVID-19. Full disclosure: my mother has 3 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and has a QR code to prove it.  You see, my mother entered Canada on a ""parent and grandparent super visa"" (introduced way back in 2012 to allow parents and grandparents of Canadian citizens and permanent residents to visit Canada long term). At the time, she was approved for a 2 year stay (she needed to buy her own health insurance but that is it). At the time, she already had an immigration application pending.  Shortly after she landed under the super visa scheme, her immigration application was approved and she ""soft crossed"" the US-Canada border with just her Chinese passport with a newly issued immigration visa on foot (by soft crossing, I mean you leave the Canadian side but never try to enter the US and since she did not have a US visa, she would not have been allowed to go to the US anyway). Once she did that, she became a permanent resident and has had this status ever since. Her passport expired in 2021 though, and something weird is happening. Let me explain.  Back in July of 2021, right around the time that her passport expired, the National Immigration Administration of China issued an order to severely limit who is allowed to apply for Chinese passports. Only those with an Offer of Admission to a foreign school or a job offer from a foreign employer is allowed. Since this order, very ridiculous stories have surfaced:  1. Middle-aged woman in China tries to apply for a passport to go to America because her daughter gave birth to a baby there and she wants to visit. The Chinese authorities refused her passport application citing COVID-19 restrictions. 2. Chinese man who frequently flew between Shanghai and Los Angeles pre-pandemic because his wife and son both live in America got stopped by Chinese Customs officials despite having a valid passport and US Visa. They make him show his wife's ID and even his child's birth certificate, and was questioned extensively on why he needed to go. Once he landed at LAX, he (a foreign national by definition) was not scrutinized by American officials at all, in sharp contrast to when he was exiting China (a country where he is a citizen). 3. Chinese person immigrated to Singapore and has permanent residence status there. Due to the pandemic, the person's passport cannot be renewed at the embassy and as a result, they risked losing permanent residence status and face deportation to China (granted, that in Canada, if you are a permanent resident, it is not mandatory for you to have a passport from your country of origin, nor is it mandatory to possess a permanent resident card, as long as you remain in Canada, so this story applies to only certain countries). The person in question owns a condo in Singapore and may be forced to sell it if permanent residence status is lost.  So, going back to my mother, her passport expired 6 months ago. Since she is not a Canadian citizen, she is not able to get a Canadian passport. But when I went onto the app (Chinese Consulate) that is used to apply for Chinese passports, I realized the required documents are ridiculous. Not only do you need your expired passport and photos for the new passport, you also need to go through facial recognition, submit a document (like a health card, driver's license or bank statement) to prove which province in Canada you live in). In addition, there is a requirement for a photo of the applicant holding up a copy of a recent mainstream newspaper (by recent, they mean within 3 days of taking the photo). They also have this warning: due to COVID-19, in person applications for passports are not accepted, and as a result, your passport will not contain your fingerprint and therefore, you will not be able to use the self serve kiosk when entering China.  Given how hard it is to get a passport these days, I have doubts on whether my mother will even be allowed to get a passport.

[Ontario, Mar. 2021 \[""Environmental Scan:  COVID-19 Immunity Status and Considerations  for Public Health Measures,"" Public Health Ontario\]](https://www.publichealthontario.ca/-/media/documents/ncov/phm/2021/03/covid-19-environmental-scan-immunity-passports.pdf?la=en):  This is a policy research document about immunity status/vaccination status is reflected in extra-jurisdiction policy, weighing the merits of a passport system. The policy research document is framed at answering whether vaccine/immune status is a viable tool  for reducing restrictions.  &gt;It is important to have a robust framework by  which to assess population-level risks and benefits of immunization-based relaxation of public health  measures. Critically, advice should be sought from public health ethicists to examine the implications of  unequal application of liberties and residual risks, and the potential for exacerbating the inequities  experienced by Ontario populations during the pandemic. With emerging VOC demonstrating some risk  for vaccine escape, relaxing measures must be addressed through a cautious and informed  approach.   &gt;   &gt;Given recent changes to the interval from first dose to second dose in Canada, the population of fully  vaccinated individuals, using the US CDC definition, is unlikely to increase in the near-term, leaving  primarily health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities as the main groups fully  vaccinated.    Relaxation of individual-level case and contact management measures (E.g., requirements  for quarantine) and setting-specific measures (E.g., visitor policies for long-term care) may be  contemplated given the full vaccination of these populations, but it is important to consider the low  community-level rates of fully vaccinated individuals that is likely to persist for several months, as well  the residual risks from VOC with vaccine escape and vaccine failure for those who are vaccinated.  Of course, I'm sure there are many more policy documents out there combing through this in fine detail. But it's important to remember that the passports weren't originally intended as a coercive measure; rather, as a measure to allow the retraction of certain public health restrictions.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/s1dpz8/tightening_rules_for_the_unvaccinated_is/hs8gd23/

I'm more hopeful that after all the vaccination and all the immunity from people getting Omicron, that subsequent waves will finally be much milder in terms of hospital use. As we get immune to more variants (OG for vaccine, and Omicron), we're better protected against future ones.  It's also a bit late for mandating vaccination. Many unvaccinated people will have caught COVID in the last months and be very well protected already. They were more likely to catch Delta, and now Omicron is everywhere. So it's unclear if there's any scientific justification for mandating vaccination at this point. I do have concerns though that the government will use this to start mandating boosters, as their benefits for most people aren't nearly as clear as the two doses, and we also have at least hundreds of thousands of people who've had their immune system booster due to Omicron.

109,4,1641972792,"For one, it's not mandatory for businesses to implement. In Alberta, no business is required to implement the Restrictions Exemption Program, it is simply encouraged for businesses because it allows them to operate at higher capacities and ignore certain health restrictions. In effect, many businesses opted in because they need the revenue, however, it was framed as entirely voluntary instead of being mandatory for the specific reason that one of Kenney's promises was that Alberta would not issue vaccine passports, and there was staunch opposition from some UCP members.   This is not the case in other provinces. Vaccine passports are mandatory for many businesses in other provinces. For example, In Alberta, restaurants that wish to provide indoor dining will need to check for vaccine status, whereas in BC, any restaurant that provides table service (including patio and other outdoor service) is required to check for vaccinations. Here in Alberta, places of worship are not eligible for the vaccine passport at all, meaning they have to abide by more stringent public health guidelines. This is in contrast to BC and Quebec's guidelines. In BC, if a religious congregation is 100% vaccinated for 12+, there are no capacity limits. In Quebec, vaccination is required for entry into houses of worship, with exceptions for the homeless. One of the Sikh temples I attend here in Edmonton wanted to implement the REP so that they wouldn't have to abide by strict capacity rules as their space is very small. They were told they couldn't and because of this langar (free veg. meal) service is greatly reduced.   Alberta was also one of the last provinces to implement a proof of vaccine program to access certain businesses (we were second only to SK IIRC). This despite high support for such a system in the province. We only implemented it after COVID cases got so high a public health emergency was declared in September 2021.   I'm not a member of the 'everything Kenney does is terrible, UCP are worse than the Nazis' echo-chamber many in my province seem to be a part of (just look at the Alberta provincial subreddit), but our restrictions are slightly less than other provinces, and the whole 'it's voluntary' aspect was clearly meant to avoid blowback from the antivax crowd.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/s1jpqt/quebec_to_impose_significant_financial_penalty/hsbm9ck/

I don't think alcoholics and adrenaline junkies place nearly enough load on our hospitals to justify fining them in the current circumstances. I'd be happy to change my view if you have evidence showing that they are loading our hospitals in a comparable degree to obesity. Keep in mind that obesity is the single largest controllable risk factor for severe Covid outcomes, and many of our Covid hospitalizations are due to obesity, in part.  &gt; Jane not getting her vaccine could put Betty in danger through no fault of her own, whereas if Betty is overweight it has no impact on Jane at all.  Jane can spread Omicron to Betty just as easily regardless of whether Jane or Betty are vaccinated. Our current vaccines do not provide significant protection against infection with or transmission of Omicron. In fact, [the latest study out of Toronto](https://hospitalhealthcare.com/covid-19/third-covid-19-vaccine-dose-37-effective-against-omicron-after-7-days/) shows that those with two doses of a vaccine actually had an increased chance of infection relative to the unvaccinated. To be clear, I'm not citing this in support of the idea that the vaccines actually cause a reduction in immunity. This is almost certainly not the case. The increased chance of infection is most likely because we allow the vaccinated to acquire vaccination passport and travel / mingle more freely than the unvaccinated.  If Betty is overweight, it endangers Jane because she is increasing the odds she will require hospitalization related to her obesity, and if that occurs, she'll be taking up resources that will be unavailable if Jane simultaneously requires hospital treatment for any other condition.  Likewise, if Betty refuses to get vaccinated, she is increasing the odds she will require hospitalization related to Covid, and if that occurs, she'll be taking up resources that will be unavailable if Jane simultaneously requires hospital treatment for any other condition.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/s0nepc/study_shows_third_covid19_vaccine_dose_37/hs3k6f2/

121,0,1641682901,"&gt;Why are you giving me semantic BS?   &gt;   &gt;A vaccinated person can still be exposed to COVID, and if so obviously vaccines aren't a force field that prevents a virus from coming near your body. But they do prevent infection to the point where it can't even be detected on a test and where you yourself are not spreading it.  I mean you're the one posting semantic BS dude. You said it prevents infection and act like it's some kind of shocker that people who were vaccinated 6 months ago have a weaker immune response are developing more serve illnesses and as such are no longer considered fully vaccinated. Let me quote you a few times here.   &gt;Me: Vaccines don't prevent you from contracting viruses.  &gt;Sure they do, at least to some extent. In the past we could see from data that vaccinated people were less likely to even get COVID to begin with. That is no longer true.  You can call it semantics if you want to but language matters and when you say things like ""vaccines don't prevent you from getting covid anymore"" you're spreading bullshit misinformation. Especially after a new variant comes out and you sound like they're not effective.  People who don't know better are going to read it and be misinformed. Talking about vaccines in terms of a magic shield isn't only stupid, it's dangerous and a serious public health issue. Look at what you said here:  &gt;Are...are you denying that previous covid vaccines reduced the chances one would get infected with COVID?  The previous vaccines are the same ones we have now. You're acting like they're useless when I clearly linked that a booster provided the same protection against all variants it did before. You're not talking about vaccinations. You're talking about vaccines. It's not semantics. You're saying ""the vaccines no longer work"" and it's dangerously misleading and false.  &gt;On say, October 15, 2021 (just picking a random date) the rate of COVID cases (per capita of course) for unvaccinated people was 7.68, while it was 1.36 for fully vaccinated people. The per capita rate of COVID cases was far higher for unvaccinated people.  &gt;Is that because the vaccine prevented vaccinated people from exposure to COVID? No, it's because the vaccine reduced the chance that COVID would progress to the point where it could even be detected on a test.  Yes, agreed. This is my point. Vaccines work.  &gt;Now look at January 1, 2022. Now the numbers are different, and the COVID cases per capita are no longer heavily skewed towards the unvaccinated.  Yes, they clearly are, because people without the booster are no longer fully vacinated. Like I explained previously before linking to the scientific evidence that boosters provide very good protection.  &gt;Now the vaccinated have a higher case rate per capita. Which is the point I was making all along. In the past, vaccines prevented the vaccinated from getting COVID, as we can see from case rates per capita. Now that is no longer true.  No, it's entirely true and the facts have not changed. People with adequate vaccination to be considered ""fully vaccinated"" are being making up 3% or so of hospitalizations. I said this and you replied with results of a population that only recently started administering the booster in the middle of the holiday season with an strain of the virus that is 10 times more virulent.  Needing a booster doesn't mean the vaccines are not working as well as they used to. It just means they require booster shots which is a normal part of any vaccination schedule. Of any medical treatment really. It's like claiming that Tylenol doesn't alleviate headaches because you took one 12 hours ago and your headache came back. It's exactly like that. And it's nonsense.  &gt;LOL, this is complete bullshit. Fully vaccinated has always referred to the number of doses you've had. Every single health authority uses that criteria  I mean you have to use your brain here. It's number of doses over time. Those statements were given in that context for sure. If one dose meant you're ""not fully vaccinated"" because they saw in trials it's immune response quickly faded without the second booster dose giving a more lasting immune response that per your data lasted till October, and 2 doses has clearly faded over about 6 months, what does that mean?  If you vaccinate your dog for rabies they're fully vaccinated for 1-3 years. They are. It fades after than then and you need a booster. Is your dog vacinated 5 years later? Take all the time you'd like to answer.  &gt;Their definition of fully vaccinated cases is: Number of cases where symptoms started 14 days or more after receiving: the second dose of a 2-dose vaccine series, or a single-dose vaccine series (for example, Janssen). Get the fuck out of here with this gaslighting.  Well dude what do you want me to say? When you have a brilliant shining light like Doug Ford at the helm WTF kind of responses do you expect? Yes, you do have to think for yourself from time to time. They have yet to officially change it but again if you just you know, read the news, you'll see everyone prepping to make the change.  It obviously has changed and the reasons it hasn't become official yet is political not medical. They want to make sure everyone has had a chance to actually get the third shot because it totally limits your access to society via passports and mandates. I can't think of anything more ignorant than taking your medical cues from Doug Fucking Ford. Look at the man. Do you think he has an inkling about health?

Not getting it makes you liable to spread the disease, therefore making you responsible for making people sick. Hence my point: there is no downside to getting the vaccine - it increases your resistance against the disease if you're unlucky enough to get it. Instead of owning up to that and admitting that this is wrong, ethically speaking, you will diverge the conversations to ""but the governement, lockdowns, restrictions, muh freedom, muh rights, tokebekicitte, etc.""  Here's another fact: if over 98% (or thereabouts) of the population gets the vaccine, and gets the booster shots once they are offered, there would be no need for any restriction, lockdown, curfews, or vaccine passport. None of that would be necessary, because we would have enough immunity among the population to make the virus less of a threat to our health system. Things would not be perfect, and the government needs to eventually fix the problems that covid highlighted (otherwise all this will happen again next time a pandemic happens and we don't have the vaccine yet).

128,2,1641671406,"My stance is that vaccines help prevent severe hospitalisation, they do. Young healthy folks are not the ones being hospitalized. Both those statements can be true. It seems to me that if you have comorbidities, not wanting the vaccine seems dumb. You put yourself at risk and potentially put the system at risk (more on that in a little bit). It is also true that if you are healthy and/or already had covid, you really don’t have that much risk. Omicron’s surge is being used to justify the curfew and possible vaccine passport overuse. Those measures don’t prevent transmission. Vaccines don’t prevent transmission (just look at the current situation compared to 2 years ago, it’s worse in terms of transmissiblity, which indicates that those liberty-infringin measures don’t seem to work. Now their are talks of elarging the passport’s use to pharmacy and grocerie store. Would you be ok with denying young, healthy (and who already got covid) people the right to buy food or to selfheal just because they don’t want to take a vaccine that mostly does not matter for the majority of them ? And what about the way hospitalisations are counted ? Is it actually true that 50% of COVID-RELATED hospitalisations are non-vaccinated people ? This is just the tip of the problem, but I want to be able to discuss it kindly and I fully respect your point of view (even thought I still don’t know it). I believe that we all have to unite under the same goals and values. Respecting individual integrity and boosting our healthcare system to juggle with the « at-risk » population. No need for all those overreach and those big pharma corporations putting their fingers up in the strings of all this (especially since they used taxpayer dollars to fund the researches for those vaccines). The average citizen should not be accused of causing hospital congestion while he’s been paying his entire life for a system that is supposed to be prepared for such an eventuality (pandemics)",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/rz4h36/files_on_sunwing_party_flight_passengers_sent_to/hrtefnb/
129,0,1641541737,"&gt; 1) The younger self selling point would be more cogent if the averaging across demographics weren't happening. I remember the general sense of shock early on when the median age of covid deaths was over 80. This was not part of the BC public health narrative. Nor was the nature of the comorbidities in the sick and dying. This was likely to instill a disproportionate sense of risk in younger people by leaving it up to their imaginations and was a bit unfair. Maybe it was just the media, but I used to watch Bonnie Henry's briefings and these weren't exactly pointing me in the right direction.  Orders of magnitude is meaningless when the risk is still marginally low. Despite all the fears of side effects from the vaccines the message has always been that the risks of getting the vaccine are far outweighed by the consequences of getting COVID, regardless of your age. And the public is horrible at calculating risk: you have people who are still using the ""chance of side effects"" excuse even though their risk is MINISCULE.   &gt; 2) Yes nutters misrepresent ""less effective"" as ""not effective"". I agree. Radicalized people cannot be reached. The best you can hope for is for time to prove them wrong and to be forgiving and welcoming if they want to leave the cave. Goes for people who panic at the thought of pre-pandemic life as much as it goes for people who've thought the whole response is running on carefully pulled strings.  Or, like smokers where smoking is forbidden in many places, require vaccination to be able to enter. Because clearly, if they're left to their own devices then they will just choose to reinforce their own beliefs about why the vaccines don't work, and then end up contracting COVID and spreading it to other nutters, a not-insignificant fraction of whom will end up flooding the ICUs. You can reason about and cajole them, and at the end of the day any progress you have made will be wiped out when they log in to facebook and get fed the same talking points over and over again. It's like wilful brainwashing at this point.  &gt; I do disagree that the honest messaging was tried though. At least in my province. We tried nice, calm messaging, but never frank and honest messaging. The mask fiasco at the beginning was bad. The treatment of natural immunity was bad and in Canada it's sill bad. The confusion between ""of"", ""from"", ""with"" covid was bad. Changing accommodations for unvaccinated people on flights and in work places because there needed to be a difference between LPC and CPC approaches during the election was bad. These are Canada specific.  I cannot speak for BC as I do not live there. But I have personally seen interviews on CTV news IIRC where vaccine news have pretty obvious disclaimers about how well they are at preventing severe disease and death even if not infection.  &gt; My issue with anti-vaxxer is that it now applies to people who oppose any regulation for mandating any vaccine. If someone does not like the idea of the passport they are an anti-vaxxer under this new definition and this label still has power because of what it used to mean. The label is also being overloaded and dehumanized to make people fearful of the social consequences of having it applied to them.  Perhaps it might be because I live in a different province, but I have not seen this effect happen anywhere IRL. Maybe on the internet. But the antivaxxers who I have worked with in the past were treated normally and nobody bothered to intrude on their decision.  &gt; I do not think that someone who's against government granting itself new powers, that might be used under different circumstances, should be stigmatized as though they were doing the thing the government doesn't approve of.   That is what I believe is a slippery slope fallacy. The mere _possibility_ of it being used under different circumstances does not have to mean that you stop something that is justified to be beneficial.  &gt; I don't think people should have the right to drive under the influence or distracted.  And that's what's happening here.  &gt; In the same way, with omicron, it's no longer equivalent to legally blind vs 20/20, they both have issues with transmission.   Except one group is far more likely to end up in the ICU? As for transmission, I believe one way to reduce it is for people to use n95s more widely, but I think fit testing on a mass scale is infeasible. I'm not a public health expert though so I just defer to them.  &gt; But to me what I was writing about was overloading words, weaponizing them socially and applying them more broadly. My smoker example isn't great but I didn't want to use a marginalized group of people for illustrative purposes.  Well that's great because unlike getting a vaccine, a person doesn't _choose_ to belong to a marginalized society on purpose. (Unless they have a persecution fetish.

So, I think you need to clarify what you mean.  Do you mean the mRNA method of developing a vaccine? That's about a 35 year old technology that's already been in active use creating vaccines to handle ebola outbreaks in Africa for about 15 years, now. Sure, it's the first time it's been used in North America, but that's kind of par for the course, because it's a technique that was created to allow for rapid vaccine development, and we haven't had the need for it until now, unlike Africa's recent history.

139,1,1641491348,"&gt; but you understand the reason why we shouldn't just allow people to choose not to get vaccinated is because it reduces the efficacy of the vaccine right?  If the vaccine is effective then why do you need everyone to get it to maintain its effectiveness? You should be protected regardless if anyone around you is vaxxed or not. Also its interesting how as soon as there was a rise in cases, the vaccine passport program was IMMEDIATELY thrown out the window. You know how vaccinated people would be allowed to hang around other vaxxed people because the risk of spread was low among them?  As I said that line of BS was quickly exposed to be false when at the first sign of trouble the vaxxed can't even hang out with their fellow vaxxed people because of the fear that the vaccine couldn't do its job to protect all those who got their two and three shots.  &gt; It's not about only protecting the individual, allowing for people to not get vaccinated means we create potential for outbreaks, rather than herd immunity.  And yet with near 90% vaccination rate among the 12+ population in Canada that hasn't done anything to stop infections from rising. So you don't trust the vaccines enough to protect the people and not have to shutdown society again and you don't trust the vaccines enough to prevent the spread of the virus. So what's the point of getting everyone vaxxed when again at the first sign of trouble you don't even believe in the vaccines that you insist will save everyone from the pandemic and then go back into panic mode and shut everything down again?  Also I just looked it up and did you know that 223,000 Canadians over 70 died in 2021? Contrast that with about 24,000 people 70+ who have died to covid over 2 years of pandemic, it means that on average 12,000 per year died to covid in the 70+ age demographic. That means that super scary covid was responsible for barely 5% of all 70+ senior deaths annually even among the absolutely most impacted and vulnerable age demographic.  I mean seriously you'd think that with the most at risk groups of people covid should be ravaging them and there should be tens of thousands of deaths among them and yet this virus can't even do that. Here's a thought perhaps we should spend more resources on preventing the other 95% of 70+ people dying annually than worrying so much about the virus that's only responsible for 5% of deaths from that age group the past couple of years?  Also just saying that African nations collectively have a combined vaccination rate of barely 10% and have most have poor medical systems to deal with covid patients and guess what? They're still doing orders of magnitude better than all us super advanced western countries. So if vaccination is so important then why are African nations doing so great vs pretty much any western nation and all their highly vaccinated populations and advanced medical systems?  And also lets never mention Japan who had such low vaccination rates until July 2021 and they too never died by the tens of thousands.

144,0,1641406735,"&gt; Lots of people died who were under 50 and healthy prior, and even thinking of it in the simple died vs. survived dichotomy isn't right. Many survived with complications and disabilities. And even if it were ""only"" a few people, it would be worth the rest of us getting vaccinated, to help them.  Yes people under 50 have died. A grand total of 821 in almost 2 years of the pandemic. A grand total of 20 people under 20 years old have died all this time. Yes THESE are the numbers that we should lose our minds over when far more people under 50 die to a number of other things than they ever will of covid.  I get it. We don't want anyone to die, but the reality is that in Ontario ALONE nearly 300 people die everyday in this province of various causes and yet why have we never shutdown society to prevent all THOSE deaths? Contrast that to if nearly 300 people dying to covid everyday in the province and we would never reopen to normal for perhaps years.   So my question is why have we gotten use to and accepted that people die when it comes to for non-covid causes, but we can't accept that people die of covid too and get on with life especially when so few are dying to covid these days thanks to the most vulnerable being vaccinated?  And if we're talking about 'not overwhelming' our hospitals, simply reducing heart disease cases or obesity related illnesses would lower our hospital numbers far more than eradicating covid ever will. Covid will eventually be largely a non-issue whether it be months or a year or two more. Heart diesease/obesity etc. illness will still be around indefinitely taking up hospital resources and spending money in reducing that would benefit the medical far money forever than spending so much time and energy on covid ever will.  Also at the beginning of the pandemic back in 2020, through emergency measures Ontario was able to open up 10,000+ beds and 2,400 ICU beds for covid patients. So we're very far away from having our medical system 'collapse' if we're taking measures to create space to treat patients.  &gt; Also, we're only sitting at a 76.49% of the population who are fully vaccinated (that's not even accounting for the booster shot). Vaccines do work, but when we have people lagging in getting vaccinated (due to antivaxers, but also disparities in vaccine availability on a global level), it results in new variants being created. This is why we're shutting down again currently, because of Omicron.  If you're not counting 11 and under kids who are barely affected by the virus, we're at 87%+ vaccination rate for 12 and older which is among the highest in the world. Also you keep saying 'anti-vaxxer' when probably a large portion of people who are unvaccinated are most likely in the pro-choice category and aren't against people deciding to get the shot if they want it. If you want the shot then by all means get it, but don't force your paranoia on other people because the neverending fearmongering from our experts and the media has gotten to you.  &gt; I disagree, if our infection rates and ICU rates were low, then I don't think we would be shutting down. The reason we are now isn't because the government wants to go back on a promise they made to those who are vaccinated, it's because we're at risk for our healthcare system collapsing, because a new variant is ripping through our population   Our infection rates, hospital and ICU numbers were low for the entire summer and up until December yet we never fully reopened because of super spooky Delta variant and the fear that THAT variant might 'overwhelm our syste'. So yeah I seriously doubt that our experts care about the numbers because when they're high they go nuts in trying to decrease them and when they're very low they'll drag out the reopening 'just to be sure' and by then fall has come and/or a new 'variant of concern' pops up that makes fully reopening not possible.  Compare that to Japan that has seen several spikes in cases the past 2 years and their response is STILL to keep things open, but to on a few occasions ask businesses to closer earlier AND THAT'S IT. THAT'S what WE should be doing and that's what we were assured would happen once we got high vaccination rates and the passport.  The fact that we've gone back to shutting things down and imposing restrictions even on the fully vaccinated and have completely thrown out the vaccine passport program means our politicians and experts have little faith in the vaccines being able to do their job. If they weren't deceiving the public and believed in the vaccines as much as they said they did, then they'd keep the vaccine passport system going and allow the vaccinated to gather with other vaccinated because supposedly the transmission between vaxxed people was suppose to be many times lower than the unvaxxed.   That whole program got flushed down the toilet at the first sign of trouble and now the vaxxed are being treated no differently as the unvaxxed like I and many others predicted would happen. Won't be surprised if/when people with 2 shots will no longer be considered 'fully vaccinated'.

The premiers are bungling this bigtime that said federal government ousted plenty of non-vaccinated and denied them EI despite the fact plenty of them have been paying into it their entire lives I have an axe to grind with them over that one.

The vaccines aren't nearly as effective at preventing spread because whatever immunity that was acquired for the first variant has waned significantly and the variants have picked up like wildfire.  The whole thing is a bungled up shitshow; change my mind.

153,4,1641391630,"&gt; Right, but that means that over half are happening outside of LTC's - and again, that's already with the help of the vaccines slowing the spread down and helping create stronger immune responses, leading to higher survival rates.  The fact that you're not mentioning is that long before vaccines existed and were widely available, it was mainly the 70 and older demographics that were predominately dying from the virus. There was a significant amount of deaths among the 60-70 age group, but nothing like in the 70+ group which represented the vast majority of covid deaths. The 60 and older groups still represent like 94% of all covid deaths in Canada right now.  The point is many people keep talking about the vaccines effectiveness, but they're not willing to admit that the effectiveness VARIES GREATLY depending on age demographics. For seniors and people who have medical conditions, the vaccines benefited them significantly which is why the number of deaths plummeted as soon as the majority of them got their vaccinations. Even now with Omicron it so far hasn't affected the 60 and over crowd too much in pushing the death rate back up. So the vaccines work well for them.  HOWEVER for the 50 and under age groups, there weren't many deaths before the vaccine existed and the same holds true now. Namely the virus never affected anyone 50 and under and were decently healthy in any significant way even before they got vaccinated. This is especially true for 20 and under people who still have a combined 20 deaths to covid and barely makeup 2% of all hospital cases in Canada.  If we're talking strictly on facts, it seems like our experts and politicians who are hellbent on getting everyone vaccinated want to completely ignore THESE facts that go against their narrative that everyone needs the shot. So it looks like 'facts matter' until it shows something they don't like and then they ignore/cover it up. Yeah we can TOTALLY trust these people. &gt;_&gt;  &gt; If we didn't have the vaccination rate we do now, deaths would have been even higher, potentially with more variants being produced.  Deaths have always been the highest among 70+ people and have NEVER been high among the 50 and under people. This was the case long before vaccines existed. Now that they're widely available vaccines have greatly reduced senior deaths which is awesome, but has impacted people under 50 much less. Maybe it helped them get more milder symptoms if they caught the virus, but it certainly has little impact on deaths.  &gt;  If we all wore masks constantly, and didn't relax once things started looking up, we'd still be in a better position than we are today, but vaccines are a key component to us getting this thing over with.  The Japanese people have worn masks regularly, but that's pretty much ALL they've done consistently and they've been living near normal lives since May 2020. If Canadians were told that regular mask wearing would allow them to get back to almost normal lives like the Japanese have I'm sure most would take that deal, but I doubt our government would stop with the shutdowns and restrictions just because we all wore masks regularly.   And lets be real. If vaccines were the key in ending this pandemic then we wouldn't be shutting down again and putting in more restrictions when almost 90% of all Canadians have gotten their two shots. The WHOLE POINT of achieving such high vaccination rates and getting the passport was to deal with exactly this kind of situation. By their actions they're pretty much admitting that they have no belief that the vaccines are doing their job otherwise they wouldn't be taking such drastic measures when so many Canadians have 'done their duty' and have gotten their shots because they believed what our experts and politicians told them, but now all these double and even triple vaccinated people who got their passports all ready to go are STILL being treated like the unvaxxed anyways at the first sign of trouble.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/rv5jvw/ontario_closes_schools_until_jan_17_bans_indoor/hrcs3cu/

156,2,1641240254,"&gt; I mean - it’s 30% of the hospitalizations and 64% of icu beds, while only being 12% of the population. I’d say that is an outsized burden compared to its size.   We're still talking about hundreds, not thousands of unvaxxed covid patients in Ontario hospitals. Namely unvaxxed covid patients ARE NOT rising in massive amounts right now just as they didn't during the super infectious Delta wave and I bet it will remain that way.   &gt; The only reason it doesn’t look so bad is because so many people got the vaccine. It alleviates both transmission and hospitalization, though not nearly as much as we had hoped unfortunately.   On July 1st of this year Japan only had about 15% fully vaccinated people in their nation and they only really ramped up vaccination after that time. The point is the Japanese have place few restrictions on its population during the entire pandemic and had low vaccination rates for months when vaccines were readily available and yet they still have 12,000 fewer deaths than Canada does despite having a 36 million senior population and over 3x more people in their country living in mostly densely population cities.  Perfect storm for covid to run wild in Japan and yet they came out doing better than every major western nation by a country mile. Vaccines weren't significant in their success all that time before vaccines were available and now they've gotten much of their population vaccinated and they still remain open largely business as usual unlike Canada where our leaders and experts are going into insane crazy mode and shutting things down again.   &gt; I don’t envy those in charge right now, if measures work you’re a piece of shit because hypothetically we didn’t need them at all, and if they don’t you’re a piece of shit because you should’ve.   I agree its a shitty position to be in, but if I were in charge right now I'd keep most everything open. Our politicians and 'medical experts' assured us that high vaccination rates and passports would keep things open and yet at the first sign of trouble they've gone back to treating the fully vaxxed the same as the unvaxxed, passport or no passport, double or triple shotted or not.   How do you expect people to believe in you anymore when you tell people to get their shots and passport because the whole point of doing so was for things to stay open in situations like this? Instead they threw everything out the window and have gone back to panic mode even though we're like one of the highest vaccinated populations on the planet as if they had no belief in the vaccines working anymore.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/rv5jvw/ontario_closes_schools_until_jan_17_bans_indoor/hr463sw/

170,2,1641069769,"&gt;There are no proposed interventions that could be rolled out covid-vaccine style to effectively reduce obesity  [https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/china-restaurant-weighing-customers-intl-hnk-scli/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/china-restaurant-weighing-customers-intl-hnk-scli/index.html) Did you even bother to read what I wrote? The reason we don't see anyone campaign with obesity as a main point is because nobody gives two fucks. The same is with people who don't take the vaccine, they don't give two fucks. So therefor the government is now trying to force them to give two fucks by inconveniencing their lives. My point is that if the government and the general public attempted to inconvenience obese people as much as we are trying to inconvenience the unvaxxed (assuming people don't immediately accuse this of ""fat shaming""), obesity would be at a way lower level. At this point I am literally repeating myself. So here is a convenient list for you.     1. Government action (or really from anyone) to fight obesity would be called out as ""fat shaming"" 2. The vaccine passport is effective and normal, while a MANDATED AND ENFORCED (not a label that isn't even suggesting anything) calorie budget for each person ""is not effective"" (according to you anyway) 3.

193,0,1639946401,"Until those citing health care capacity as the reason for the reimposition of restrictions understand that a sizeable portion (possibly a majority) of the population no longer trust the government then we will never solve the systemic issues driving negative outcomes. Public health official and politicians have failed to hold up their end of the bargain in pandemic response and people are no longer willing to sacrifice their good years to protect those who won't protect themselves.    You can make the argument that it takes time to expand capacity, but we've not seen any steps taken to do so in two years. In fact, governments have been reigning in health care spending and cutting wages. We also see examples of people looking to get into health care being rejected despite exceptional academic performance (the young woman in Nova Scotia from a few months ago comes to mind).  Here's some examples:  * Millions of rapid tests are sitting unused (looking at BC) for strange reasons. False positives or false negatives, at least you'd catch more positives earlier on and push people to isolated and get a molecular test. * Failure to acknowledge the nature of spread of the virus resulting in additional cases. There needs to be an admission that this is an airborne virus and anything less than a N95 mask is like wearing nothing at all. Seriously, a cloth mask is at best 10% effective right now - citations can be found if necessary.  * Distributing proper PPE to each person free of charge. This is a relatively low-cost way of getting effective preventative tools in everyone's hands. It doesn't take two years to spin up production on these products. Prioritize the domestic production of the tools necessary to produce the masks.  * Focus on cases instead of instances of severe disease. The corporate adage, ""what gets measured gets managed,"" is entirely applicable in this pandemic. This sort of shifted with the vaccine passport, but the reimposition of restrictions on vaccinated individuals rejects the science that outcomes for vaccinated individuals are still excellent. If restrictions are to buy time for additional boosters (as the Dutch have stated) then suspending vaccine administration for a week is completely unacceptable. * BC is closing down vaccination locations for the holidays (Coastal Health is closed Dec 24 - Dec 28). I get that staff need a break, but during a surge we need all hands on deck to protect as many people as possible. Supply isn't an issue. We could even have dentists and naturopaths administering boosters if needed (creative solutions) * Failure to acknowledge several largely preventable or controllable comorbidities driving severe outcomes, such as: obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, smoking, substance abuse, etc.  Driving down rates of these conditions would mean fewer people in hospital and fewer people dying.  * Unnecessary cancellation of elective surgeries and preventative screenings. Several provinces cancelled these early on in the pandemic despite no surge in demand which has resulted in years long backlogs and excess deaths not directly caused by COVID. * Failure to properly fund an expansion of health care capacity (this is long term). Almost 3x the number of medical residency placements occurred in 2020 vs 2000, yet we continue to have severe shortages of primary care physicians. Anecdotally, family doctors are retiring without someone to take over their practice leaving patients without necessary care resulting in increased demand on emergency or high-cost services as conditions develop without being treated. * Tests for trips &lt;72 hours make no sense when the incubation period is longer (sometimes shorter for Omicron). You can't stop a citizen or PR from returning with a positive test at a land border, they just need a place to quarantine which is almost always their home.  I could go on, but none of these problems have even a hint of being addressed over the past two years. The result?

You know what else puts unnecessary stress on healthcare infrastructure? having unvaccinated people get covid, take up valuable resources while telling the staff ""I don't need the vaccine, it's going to kill you/its tracking your movements/its all about Bill Gates controlling the population""   we have evidence of them taking up resources in other provinces when they moved patients to ontario [https://globalnews.ca/news/8273990/saskatchewan-sending-6-icu-patients-ontario/](https://globalnews.ca/news/8273990/saskatchewan-sending-6-icu-patients-ontario/)  \&gt;And plenty of first-world countries give out rapid tests to every household for pennies on the dollar, but Canada simply isn't interested in reducing spread by that much. This further undermines the point. After all, why should provinces be proactive when no one is forcing them?  rapid tests are cool. but they don't prevent spread like a vaccine does. Vaccines reduce spread passively while testing is meant for tracking case numbers and possibly preventing future spread if (IF) the positive person takes measures to isolate (active method of reducing spread)  \&gt;And most restrictions were designed with pre-delta ""vaccinated people barely spread it!"" delusions in mind. Omnicron will soon turn stadiums of 30,000 rabid fans into superspreader events.  You say pre-delta like delta was eradicated, or the original covid isn't still killing people.

214,0,1638537943,"I'm seeing some lazy accusations and reactionary comments here already (quelle surprise), so I think I need to separate the valid and problematical arguments that the writer lays out.  &gt;The government, of course, will never walk back its emergency powers of its own volition. And why would they? After two years of fomenting terror and division among the population, they have cultivated a solid base of support that combines the post-9/11 see-something-say-something paranoia of a middle-class yuppie with the unctuous 1980s Moral Majority sense of superiority.  This is excessive. The tone of these words weakens the entire piece, even if I have seen some of this tendency for myself.  &gt;Yet, in Ontario, even as the province exceeded by weeks its vaccination and case number targets of the government's phased reopening plan, citizens were offered only breadcrumbs in return: moving up Phase 3 reopening by just a few days, with no plans at the time for a complete reopening.  The tone of this comment is unhelpful. It's not a matter of ""breadcrumbs"" and rewards from the government.  &gt;that exposes the flaw inherent in governments' COVID response: for nearly two years, debate and dissent from burdensome COVID restrictions has been short-circuited with demands that citizens ""trust the science""; a modern take on debate-defusing exhortations to ""support our troops"" during the War on Terror.  I totally agree that there is a huge tendency on the part of very loud people to shut down debate, to label anyone who raises questions as ""anti-vax"" (what was it that Orwell said about political speech and monosyllables, again?). You have only to read countless threads on r/canada to see that. That being said...  As a student in the physical sciences, I find the writer takes the analogy too far here. Yes, I'm biased, but ""trust the science"" is not as atavistic and dishonest as ""support the troops"". I completely agree that science is not meant for simple-minded slogans like that - anyone who has really tried to do science, to generate verifiable knowledge, knows all about doubt, debate and criticism. So, as problematic as it is to silence people by saying ""trust the silence"", it doesn't shut down debate like the spectre of military action.  &gt;It was a precipitous but inevitable shift from ""two weeks to flatten the curve"" to get the jab or lose your job, and unsurprisingly, there is still more to come. Met the provincial vaccination targets? Great; but now it's time for a booster. Ready for the ""temporary"" vaccine passport system to expire? Sorry, we need to extend it through spring ...  There is a certain amount of flexibility and patience that is required of us to wrestle the pandemic down, so I cannot agree with the general tenor of this comment.  &gt;Less than a year ago, government and public health officials touted vaccination as a panacea to end the pandemic. It's safe, effective and will allow the country to put COVID behind us, we were told.  Getting warmer. I find that many of the public health pronouncements have had a profoundly infantilizing air, and that since before March of 2020 (I'm thinking of the WHO, particularly).  &gt;Every infringement on citizens' privacy, mobility, autonomy and conscience rights has been justified by officials in the name of the infallible technocratic might of ""the science."" But when proven wrong – or more importantly, unpopular at the polls – that formerly rock-solid science on which officials acted is simply dismissed out of hand. Policymakers, however, cannot on one hand demand unyielding adherence to science, and then down the road simply hand-wave away their previous demands on the grounds that their knowledge or political fortunes have evolved.  No argument here.  &gt;It is for this precise reason that checks and balances exist in governance: to prevent rule through unaccountable technocratic appeals to authority. Debate and dissent in the age of COVID, however, have become four-letter words.   &gt;   &gt;Our public health officials and elected politicians should not at this point expect any benefit of the doubt. Considering that we are still taking our shoes off and binning bottles of water at airport security 20 years after 9/11, that government officials and their unelected mandarins are unwilling to cede their newfound power in an age of COVID should not come as any surprise.  Here our privacy lawyer is arguing on his best ground. I challenge anyone to provide a rebuttal to these statements.  &gt;As the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) once knew, ""There will always be a new disease, always the threat of a new pandemic."" Accordingly, the number of boosters, or the percentage of fully-vaccinated citizens, needed for a return to normal will always be n+1. Meet one metric, and be met with two more. As the ACLU continues, ""If fear of disease justifies the suspension of liberties and the institution of an emergency state, then freedom and the rule of law will be permanently suspended.""   &gt;   &gt;Already we see public health officials priming the pump for the next goalpost shift. Even if vaccine uptake is high among five to 11-year-olds, it will still not be good enough. According to Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's chief public health officer, toddlers under the age of four will be next to need the shots, claiming with an absolute lack of shame that – unlike all the other times we were promised an end to the pandemic – vaccinating that group will be a ""turning point.""  I don't need to accuse Theresa Tam or any other official of conspiracy theories or dark motives in order to agree here. Public health officials in Canada have been undermining and short-circuiting themselves in a number of ways since March of 2020. The sense of scrambling, the subtly-conveyed lack of foresight they've evinced, has not been encouraging. But their refusal to provide a **firm, science-based set of conditions our society needs to meet in order to safely remove a given restriction** is troubling - alarming - in precisely the way this lawyer states. The authoritarian and hateful turn to subs like r/canada and r/ontario seals it for me. Why do public health and federal political officials refuse to come out and say that measures like vaccine passports and travel restrictions are temporary, and will expire after a set (and relatively short, but renewable) period?  I am fully-vaccinated, and I intend to get a booster upon consulting with my doctor. I ""trust the science"" because it has been shown to work. What I do not, and cannot, trust, are politicians wielding self-conferred authority that they have never had before... especially not in the 21st century. Security theatre has been shown *not* to work. While some of our privacy laywer's prose is alarmist and ineffective, I cannot condemn this article. Aside from the threat to civil liberties, the worst thing about all this is that it makes me and others *less effective as advocates for vaccine uptake*.

229,0,1637700974,"&gt;This has nothing to do with the efficacy of the vaccine. My question was specifically if the same tactic (threatened job loss, denied healthcare) was used to enforce something you don't agree with, like say forced weightloss for the obese or forced drug rehab with mandatory testing for addicts. The more general question would be: is it acceptable to use such tactics in any case whether or not you agree with the issue at hand. To dumb it down is it ok to play dirty if the outcome is just and worthy.  It has all to do with the efficacy of the vaccine.  It is proven to prevent a flood of unneedless deaths within our hospitals.  However those who choose not to do it for whatever reason they deem, is still indirectly killing others who have no choice but to rely on our hospital system and care.  I have no idea why you want to compare or somewhat equate the plight of obesity or drug addiction to those that don't want to take a vaccine. Ok I'll bite.   Should those people lose their jobs? If their actions **do not** affect those in the workplace, no. If they do, then yes they absolutely should not have their job. I wouldn't want to work next to someone operating heavy machinery while under the influence.  That's why jobs have drug and alcohol testing. If someone is obese should they lose their job? If it's a firefighter responsible for rescuing people, maybe...if they can't meet the physical requirements of the job they shouldn't fill that position. If it's an overweight clerk at a law firm, absolutely not. Their obesity does not affect those around them at their place of work.  Should either of these cases be denied health care?  No. Our hospital have the capacity to handle these two cases, they don't with the surge of unvaccinated COVID victims that come in due to their own inaction.  Equating drug addicts or obesity with someone who doesn't want to be vaccinated is a poor poor argument.  &gt;Mandating a health procedure like this and forcing people to disclose health information to non health professionals (i.e. your job or a bartender) bring up serious societal, legal and moral issues that people like you are just plain ignoring.  This health information is ""yes I'm vaccinated"", ""no I'm not vaccinated"". That's it. There is nothing else being shared about your personal health history at all.  It's a poor argument. Do you agree with drug and alcohol testing? It's part of your health history is it not? You shouldn't have to disclose to anyone if you are under the influence should you?  Laughable.  I do D&amp;A testing for my job all the time, to ensure that I and those around me are safe when working around critical pieces of machinery/infrastructure. The 'vaccine passport' is the same thing but spread to the masses to ensure that I am keeping myself and those around me safe as well.  &gt;You however seem far too eager to 'other' people and punch down because you are in the 'majority'.

It's not because the vaccines don't give 100% immunity against COVID that they're completely ineffective either. Yes, the vaccine was absolutely about preventing COVID. The P-BNT efficacy peaked at 95% against developping COVID from the first SARS-Cov-2 lineage. [It even prevents infection, asymptomatic or not.](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2114114)  Sure, if you have a breakthrough infection, you'll spread the virus BUT:  * There's a much higher chance you don't get infected in the first place if you're vaccinated.

235,2,1637287088,"&gt;Obesity is more damaging than long Covid  I've been seeing this quite a bit lately which leads me to suspect it's the new narrative being pushed from certain propaganda outlets.  You can't compare obesity to an infectious disease. It just isn't the same thing. Sure obesity can result in a lot of health complications and is a significant factor in a lot of health problems and deaths.  But being in the same room with a person who is obese does not put you at risk of being obese.  The vast majority of deaths during this 4th wave (and the 3rd wave) were more or less preventable. Alberta's asinine ""Best Summer Ever"" policy where they blew the doors off of any restrictions just as delta was making its way into the province, and then firing 1/2 of their contact tracers and ceasing contact tracing in schools had an entirely predictable (and preventable) outcome.  I'm not saying that there needed to be a complete lockdown and people needed to be confined to their homes (which is usually the next thing anti-mask/anti-vax/anti-sensible policy advocates accuse people of whenever it comes up), but bringing in a vaccine passport system and ramping up contact tracing/isolation protocols would have kept the numbers low, kept hospitals from being overwhelmed, and allowed the majority of people and businesses to actually have ""The Best Summer Ever.""

To what extent would you support or oppose the introduction of a vaccine passport in your province?  Does it include the fact you won't be able to fly, travel internationally, visit unvaccinated family, or work outside the home?  Also this has to include that Ontario and Quebec(our most populace provinces), were hit hardest at the beginning of COVID, and for the longest time had the toughest restrictions were promised this as a way out of restrictions for the vaccinated, and being able to visit family again.

Now we have people who sincerely believe the unvaccinated represent a clear and present danger, and are advocating for them to be isolated and basically starved. See: Chomsky.   Now we're at a point where we've spent all this money building these vaccine pass infrastructures. The BBC is warning that this year will be bad for flu, because we weren't exposed to it last year. Well, there's a flu shot. There's also a covid booster. The passports worked well for getting people vaccinated, why not use it to get people to get their boosters and flu vaccines?   People like to claim that slippery slope is a fallacy. It isn't. Especially when I can point to a list of slippery slope arguments that we all watched come true.   Now, as the article says, you and I might have different opinions on this. Perhaps you feel this is all justified in the name of public health and safety. Maybe I don't. Maybe we have a different perspective on how this has gone throughout history.   Now, the 'personally' part.   Personally, I feel I have an obligation to change my behaviour in public to look to my own safety and welfare. I feel you do, too. But I *don't* feel that that obligation extends to me *demanding* that you change your behavior to make me feel safer. I may *ask* you to do something, and you can choose to or not to. But that's the limit. If you tell me to get fucked, then I have to move or alter my behaviour. And vice versa.   So it may be confirmation bias at play, but I feel like I've noticed this a lot more over the last 2 years. A lot of folks demanding I change my behaviour to suit them. My immediate response - because I don't score too high on the agreeableness trait - is to tell them to fuck off. I don't like to be told what to do by a societal peer. I'm perfectly content with my own risk metric for myself, and will suffer the consequences of it, and amend if necessary.   But this demand has been wrapped in this weird 'for the grea'er good' packaging. Fuck you. What if I don't think that the greater good is best served by everyone doing as they're told? What if I value individual choice higher than societal welfare as priority?   As the article notes, none of these measures have end dates. It's all, ""When we decide it's safe.""

They have been working this entire time, if they have worked for 1.5 years in that setting and NOT had covid, thats incredibly low chance of infection doing what they are already doing..?  IF they HAVE had covid, do they not get natural immunity? What is the worst that can happen? An unknown case gets through an unvax person (same can happen with vax) and they dont stay home sick, possibly passing PPE and infecting other patients or staff (who are ... vaccinated for the most part?).  The problem with covid isn't the disease, its that we have a piss poor hospital capacity especially in higher skilled worker areas like an ICU. We are always changing measures based on ICU / Hospital capacity - cases are meaningless if they don't end up in hospital to some extent (yes, more spread = more hospitalizations in theory, but if hospitalizations drop while spread goes up who really cares?).  So now you want to remove workers in a strained system, on the rare chance you may have an extra random covid infection spread, which may or may not cause any problems, because almost everyone else is vaxxed now.   The ONLY way I would take anyone seriously, is if they allowed for paid-for-by-staff DAILY covid tests prior to shifts. If they test without covid, thats a better measure to me then being double vaxxed... (I can't see how anyone can argue this at all, but supposedly in Canada testing negative is not a good indicator but having a vaxx is of potential spread?)  In addition, most health care workers were priority early in the pandemic for vaccines, and given it on proper intervals. Those people already passed 6mo mark after 2nd shot, and like on-reserve issues right now, this waning immunity is starting to show rising cases in those vaxxd populations.   If we were to ACTUALLY follow the science, we'd have daily testing prior to shifts, in addition to strict PPE adherance and vaccines. Firing them? It WILL cause more problems then reduction in cases, I will bet anyone on that.

297,8,1634163579,"*Premier Doug Ford's government will announce its new plan for lifting more of Ontario's COVID-19 public health restrictions next week, CBC News has learned.*  *The easing of pandemic measures will include ending capacity limits in all locations where proof-of-vaccination requirements are in place, such as restaurants, bars and gyms, a senior official in Ford's government said Wednesday.*  *The official provided information about the government's plans on condition of anonymity. CBC News agreed not to name the official in order to inform the public in advance of the announcement.*  *Ontario has been at Step 3 of what the government calls its ""Roadmap to Reopen"" since mid-July. The official said it's now time to unveil a ""revised pandemic plan"" that takes into account the province's success in getting the population vaccinated against COVID-19, while also keeping a lid on the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus.*  *""We owe people a clear plan to exit the roadmap,"" the official said in an interview. ""The work began months ago, we are finalizing the plan now and we expect to release it late next week.""*  *The Ontario government will not lift all public health measures and ""pretend the pandemic is over,"" said the official, noting that indoor-masking requirements will remain in place.*  *However, the plan will signal when physical distancing and capacity limits can be lifted in settings where proof of vaccination is not required, such as places of worship, the official said.*  *The plan will also indicate conditions that would prompt the government to reimpose restrictions, on a targeted and local basis, should any significant spike in new infections emerge.*  *The official declined to state which day next week the plan will be announced, nor to give a specific date of when the relaxed measures will take effect. The government has previously said Ontario's digital proof-of-vaccination app will launch on Oct. 22, which is Friday of next week.*  *News that more restrictions will be lifted comes as Ontario is seeing an average of 500 new cases of COVID-19 daily. That seven-day average figure has trended steadily downward since Sept. 5, despite the resumption of school for the province's two million elementary and secondary students.*  *The fact that in-person classes returned without producing a spike in the province's overall number of cases is one key reason why the government believes the time is right for exiting Step 3 of the roadmap, the official said.*  *Other key factors are the province's vaccination rate and little evidence of virus transmission at locations where Ontario's vaccine-passport system has been in place since Sept. 22.*  *The latest provincial figures show 83 per cent of Ontarians aged 12 and up are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and another five per cent have received one dose of a vaccine.*  *""We've watched and learned lessons from other provinces that moved too quickly to open up,"" the official said. ""We're going to continue to be cautious.""*  *However, the official acknowledges it ""was a mistake"" for the government to announce the lifting of capacity limits for spectator sports venues, cinemas and theatres, without announcing its plan for restaurants, bars and gyms. That news came late on the Friday afternoon before the long weekend.*  *The move benefited Ontario's NHL teams by giving the Toronto Maple Leafs the chance to play their home opener before capacity crowds on Wednesday night, and the Ottawa Senators able to play theirs on Thursday.But it left restaurant owners seething.*  *Members of the Ford government and Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Kieran Moore had previously indicated that the main goal for Ontario is to avoid further lockdowns, and that any future tightening of measures would be tailored toward reining in local outbreaks, with the aim of minimizing disruption to people's lives.*  *The new plan will include guidance about travel and more specifics about when the province will transition the proof-of-vaccination program from mandatory to voluntary, said the official. ""Ontarians will have a better idea of what they can expect in the months ahead as we continue to confront COVID-19,"" the official added.*  *The current description of Ontario's reopening plan on the province's website indicates that ""the majority of public health measures in effect under Step 3 will be lifted"" when Ontario moves to the next phase of its pandemic response.*  *The website says that would include removing capacity limits in all sectors and removing requirements for active screening of patrons and workers.*",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/q7m25d/ontarios_new_plan_for_lifting_covid19/hgjgewj/

There are a wide variety of issues that are causing the frustration expressed by Superstore union members’ 97 per cent strike vote last week, from wages to benefits to scheduling and beyond,” he said.  “But if there is a unifying theme to that anger and frustration, it is feeling like they just don’t matter.”  TWEET THIS CLICK TO SHARE QUOTE ON TWITTER: ""BUT IF THERE IS A UNIFYING THEME TO THAT ANGER AND FRUSTRATION, IT IS FEELING LIKE THEY JUST DON'T MATTER.""

Indeed, our public health measures have been a factor in reducing that spread but maybe healthy young adults allowing that natural spread would further help boost our immunity rates and reach our goal faster.  &gt;vaccinating children is not about preventing severe illness. It reduces the likelihood of them spreading the disease to schoolmates and family.   &gt;   &gt;In other words, natural immunity in Canada isn't enough to get us into that magic 80-88% range.  Agreed, which furthers my point that natural immunity is another tool in our toolkit that can help us get out of this faster. So long as at-risk contacts have been vaccinated then that natural spread can be beneficial (hence why Denmark's vaccine passport included 2x vax shots OR a positive covid test - and  recovery - that's no older than six months).

They only care about people that live like they do so when it comes to bylaws for covid, they just don't follow them because it goes against their way of life.  Conspiracy theories spread like wildfire in that crowd because they don't have the same education and lack the critical thinking ability to look at ""vaccine alters DNA"" and realize how stupid that concept is.  Unfortunately they are the dinosaurs and covid is an extinction level event for their population.  Here in Calgary we have about 230k eligible people that still haven't been vaccinated.  The vaccine not-a-passport program we have now will probably cut that number in half by the end of October but that's still about 100k that wont get pinned for whatever reason.  That's a lot of people to end up in a hospital.  Looking at our numbers data it looks like we've passed the peak of new cases for wave 4 about 2 weeks ago but hospital numbers are \~2 weeks later and ICU/deaths are about a week or two beyond that.  So the next month is gonna be brutal for AB.  We'll reach peak hospital admissions last/this week and then next week we're gonna see a complete break down of our healthcare system with a surge in deaths for about 2 weeks.  We're already at that tipping point and 5000 new cases happened over the weekend.  I think I might hit up the pharmacy and stock up on basic meds and first aid supplies because if an Albertan needs a hospital over the next month, we're gonna have a terrible time.

An enforced vaccine passport can get us through the worst of this by keeping unvaxxed people home and/or getting them vaxxed.

Your method of charging people does nothing to alleviate the current crisis though. It will only marginally impact vaccination rates and our healthcare system will continue to suffer. Under your method the hospitals will stay full until virtually all of the unvaxxed people have caught covid. At the current rate of infection that could take over a year, and at a 0.8% ICU rate, could lead to an extra 8,000 people in the ICU over that time. Keep in mind we usually have only 173 ICU beds, so there would be no healthcare capacity.  &gt;Then there's no way to convince them anyway.  There is a way. Vaccine passport announcements have double or tripled the rate of vaccinations everywhere they were announced. And if you have effective enforcement that trend will only increase as they aren't allowed to go to restaurants, hockey games, concerts, bars, or other recreational activities. Those are the inconveniences I am talking about. Showing your phone at those events isn't really an inconvenience compared to not being allowed to go.  If this pandemic has proven anything, it is that the people who are unvaxxed will not just stay home. It will be the tipping point for most people if they can't go out and do things.  You seem to just want to punish them with financial burdens, but nothing you have suggested will actually solve the immediate problem of the hospitals being full.

How about that 5:1 ratio you ""read about"" eh? Maybe get your numbers from official sources instead of facebook memes.   &gt;We'll all be getting overwhelmed by Delta soon enough.

Can't possibly imagine why that would be though 🤔   &gt;Were you saying all this before Japan was hit, when literally every media outlet was predicting mass death in Japan?  Really?

An under-performing medical system is an even greater argument for restrictions to prevent it from being overwhelmed.   &gt;Even bad flu seasons have caused our ICU capacity to overflow so of course COVID, which is way more infectious, will be even worse than that.  Right, so for something wildy more contagious it has an even greater chance to overwhelm ICU capacity.

Lockdowns ensure it doesn't spread as fast as it can and overwhelm our already struggling medical facilities. Im confused by your logic. You acknowledge our medical system is understaffed and under funded, yet you think covid should be allowed to run rampant and overwhelm it.   &gt;Vaccine passports are useless too.

First problem I see is children: they spend all day in a congregate setting with other unvaccinated (school)… which makes them probably much more likely to have the virus or be a vector than the average person. Yet, they are allowed in any venue which would be denied to a non-vaccinated adult. Until everyone is able to get vaccinated, you really can’t think of vaccine passport zones as “just the vaccinated”, but as “just the vaccinated and the most likely unvaccinated carriers of the virus”.   Second problem I see: unvaccinated people (who have decided they’re not going to get the vaccine) are locked out of social venues, but it doesn’t mean they’re going to not socialize. They will just do it in homes and other settings that are less safe than places with covid restrictions.   Because of these two reasons I’m not convinced that vaccines passports actually reduce the community transmission. Would love to see data to the opposite if I’m wrong.

For example, in Ontario, a teacher has to either be vaccinated or be tested twice a week for covid. But there are lots of people who criticize the government for not “mandating vaccines for teachers” because of this caveat about allowing negative tests. Similarly, I know there used to be sporting venues (not sure if they still exist) where you could show a negative test result from the day of or a proof of vaccination… but this allowance of negative tests has been very unpopular among the pro-vaccine passport folk.   Why? I have to think it’s what you said… they want the unvaccinated to be shamed, and not allowed into places just out of spite.

When it comes to what the COVID laws are in australia, I'm no expert there... their rights are different to ours and I have a sneaking feeling that there is a lot more stipulations to that particular law.  &amp;#x200B;  Can I ask what precedent you think is set with an immunization record being updated to a QR code? plenty of other institutions have required access to this information before and have been able to deny services because of it (I.E public schools). While you're right that a slippery slope is not wrong in and of itself you need to be able to clearly point to the steps down that slope that tie together, to me requiring proof of vaccination does not necessarily lead to the general public being confined to their local area and I've not seen any political voices in Canada advocating for such a restriction.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/ptugk0/arjun_singh_left_wing_values_have_invaded_canadas/he0ymlx/

I have never ""stood in line"" to access a website, and once I did enter the contents of my health card, address, DOB and postal code, I was told I was unvaccinated. Given, I'm comparing provincial and federal, but the COVID-Alert app was absolutely fantastic. It to-date has zero exploits, had an extremely small footprint (power, space, etc) and was extremely easy to set up and use (just install, if you get a positive test, you're given an unlock code and notifications are pushed to recipients). The best we have for passports is, from the [Ontario website](https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/1000779/ontario-to-require-proof-of-vaccination-in-select-settings),  &gt; Ontarians currently have access to a paper or PDF vaccine receipt that includes all relevant information to prove that they are fully vaccinated.  They promise more, with no timeline or commitment,  &gt; Ontario will also introduce an enhanced digital vaccine receipt that features a QR code, which is safe, more secure and with you wherever you go. This digital vaccine receipt can be kept on a phone and easily used to show that you've been vaccinated if you need to. In addition, the province will launch a new app to make it easier and more convenient for businesses and organizations to read and verify that a digital vaccine receipt is valid, while protecting your privacy.  A PDF is not secure, is not verifiable and is not convenient. This is a hack, to legislate the requirement without the framework is setup for failure.  I will disclaim, I am strongly in favour of vaccine passports, my disappointment comes from not being able to effectively do it. I'm average, I wasn't in the early wave of vaccines for elderly/healthcare, I wasn't a special edge case in a remote community, I'm from a big city and had all my documentation with me when I went to get it. If it didn't work for me, it didn't work others. This *has* to happen, and we have to get it right.

At the same time, the OHRC’s position is that a person who chooses not to be vaccinated based on personal preference does not have the right to accommodation under the Code.

While the Code prohibits discrimination based on creed, personal preferences or singular beliefs do not amount to a creed for the purposes of the Code.  Even if a person could show they were denied a service or employment because of a creed-based belief against vaccinations, the duty to accommodate does not necessarily require they be exempted from vaccine mandates, certification or COVID testing requirements.

438,14,1632425869,"&gt; Right, so what do we want? People with strong immunity to Covid (most easily measured by antibody count), or do we want to simply reward people for getting vaccinated even if they didn’t develop the necessary antibodies to protect themselves and other better?  Both. We want to ensure those who are participating in higher risk activities have low Covid risk, and we want to ensure that people aren't incentivized to seek antibodies through infection. The latter would the make hospital capacity crisis that exists in places like Alberta worse, as many people that assume they'd have mild cases actually won't.  &gt; Shouldn’t a vaccine passport be granted to those who can prove they have antibodies above a certain threshold to fight off COVID if it is indeed a spectrum (which I agree with)? That seems the more scientific measurement of immunity.  It simply isn't feasible to test everyone's antibody levels. There's also not one single antibody. How do we weigh the broader less variant-specific antibodies of vaccination against the antibodies from infection? The science just isn't certain enough yet to tell us.  But making access to indoor dining dependent in vaccination is easy to do, and the scientific evidence clearly favours vaccination for everyone except a narrow set of medical exemptions (including those who have previously had Covid).",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/ptbuux/172_windsor_ont_hospital_staff_suspended_without/he03aci/
439,15,1632429212,"But there is a problem.  O'Tooles ""moderate"" message was all message and no fact.  I am reading all these comments and committments about a policy review and a moderate platform.  Its complete fiction and the surface of it was designed to obfuscate the the real positions of the Conservative party:  * O'Toole was personally ""pro-choice"" but nowhere in the party platform anywhere will you find it specify it was such.  In fact my recollection is that in the past  he said he would respect any private member bills which advocated for abortion restrictions.  The party is anti-abortion and no sugar coating is going to get around that.  It allows its sitting members to formally advocate for abortion restrictions and anti-abortion policy. * Gun control.  Well we already know the facts as they intended to remove some restrictions. * Child Care:  the tax credit proposal was classic trickle down economics.  The Liberal policy would result in a person paying $220 a month for child care per child - assuming 22 days a month.  No matter how much gloss one put on the Conservative policy the best outcome would have seen a monthly child care cost several times that figure.  And you had to hope for reimbursement in arrears vs knowing a stable up front cost.  And had no money to actually build out more spots but worked on the premise that demand for child care would increase and the private sector would build out spots accordingly.  A defacto subsidization of the private sector. * Climate Change.  Another bomb per the party formally deciding not to recognize climate change as being real.  The plan has some real environmental points I liked but whether they would actually be implemented? * All things covid.  Again let us remember O'Tooles effusive praising of Kenney and his refusal to take it back.  This was a coded message to Conservative supporters that he and the party did not support vaccine passport mandates or other restrictions to control the spread of covid.  Look carefully at O'Tooles many talking points on covid.  He talked a lot and said very little, and never advocated for restrictions or controls.   Their covid plan is mostly ""post covid"" measures.  If one reads the [Conservative Platform](https://cpcassets.conservative.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08200659/e4cd8c0115c3ea0.pdf) it has a number of  good economic points in it but when its very much devoid of social policy or any immediately effective covid policy.  And again much of the economics is tax credit based plan and on some important points it is ""encourage"" this or ""study"" that but not actual commitments to change.  So I find it very humourous to read all the recent pronouncements by Conservatives that they will have a policy convention and so on to examine what and why.  Well the what and why is sugar coating matters so you can sit on the fence did not work with the educated electorate.

When the majority are just hesitant due to side effects. And even if those side effects are rare they are fully justified in having that hesitancy. They've already said, young people should only get one shot, after thousands have received 2 shots. They said mixing is okay, then it's not. They said take the first shot available and now there is a preference. The constant flip flopping and arbitrary lockdowns are at the root of a lot of these people's frustrations.  And it's not a slippery slope fallacy when it's actually happening. Last year anyone who said this would lead to a passport system was painted as a conspiracy theorist. And yet here we are.  Also, you didn't answer the question. I asked how many deaths are you comfortable with? You were obviously comfortable with 7000-8000/year for the flu. So if we can get it down to that for covid sans lockdown/masking, would that be acceptable?

467,6,1632047047,"Every province in Canada said at the beginning of this that they would never introduce Vaccines mandates or passports. And now not only are they here everyone in Canada is welcoming it with open arms. We dont need vaccine passports guys...look at the rest of world in places that dont have them and they doing better than we are here.  VACCINES yes of course.  Vaccinated are safer from the non Vaccinated directly from my doctors mouth. Non vaxx are more risk around Vaccinated people from every doctor I talked to agreed with me to my face when I was sick with Covid.  So honestly non vaxxesd should be scared now definitely. 80% of population in Canada all vaccinated we will then move to herd immunity they said..  remember this?! Were well there in Canada now but we dont even hear words of herd immunity now and to be even spoken of. And what about antibodies testing for those of us who have had Covid and made through and recovered from it.  Not even a peep of a mention that's being studied here in this province and why not.? While other countries use that as a pass just like a vaccine if you've recovered from the Virus because your antibodies are so high. Just get your Vaxx and Passport and shut up is basically what's happening here in Canada. I'm not Anti anything but I do have eyes! Lol. And shit is weird here.  Here in B.C they said vaccine passports will never happen here or vaccine madates will never happen. So that was flat lie. We also cannot test widely here in B.C yet they say for antibodies because they have no proof yet. Even though that is the way since the beginning of time to see your immunity. Once infected from a Virus and recovered that is the best vaccine you can have and you T cells now have memory of the Virus as well. WE ALL KNOW THIS. It's high school biology this information not its not Top Secret. No one will go on record or on mainstream media about antibodies why is this? I'm just curious as to why not even drop of that on mainstream media here.They all dodged this question all big Doctors running this show in the western world . No one here finds this odd in Canada? When online alot of doctors are speaking on this from around the world! When other countries even the USA do an antibodies test with no questions asked and use that information to see what your immunity is after you've been infected. Here in B.C its almost taboo right now to even ask for an antibodies test, its beyond strange. I'm not an anti vaxxer by any means, I'm not anti anything health wise or science wise. . I have spent ALOT of money in travel vaccines for other countries in my years of traveling. So I'm not an anti vaxx person by any means and this not my issue. But it's just get the vax and shut your mouth here in Canada not so free as we thought now EH? Had Covid and survived it,so I believe it's my own human personal right to see my own antibody immunity test after infection. Should be just as easy getting your antibodies test after infection, as it is to be tested for Covid here in B.C.  Also I asked to be tested for the delta variant and was told here in BC they don't test for the Delta just a positive is a positive. So how do know then it's variants going around then?  Like what is actually going on here in BC. No answers nor do they give you much information on anything when your sick or recovered from the Virus.  Just my experience with the Virus we all have different views and experiences throughout this nightmare.  Bravo to Sweden! If that makes no sense to you then just research them as they are now living back in pre covid days there now. They never had covid passports or mask madates or vaccine mandates. Interesting wouldn't you say rest of the world? I guess they just have common sense and the  respect of telling their people truths during this pandemic and not treating them all as children.

483,3,1631808309,"&gt;people like you  Thanks for this.    The argument is, that, in the before-times, outside of narrow fields, vaccines weren't mandatory as a condition of participating in every-day life.  And even within those narrow fields, the vaccines were decades old, using tried-and-true technology.  Even for school, they couldn't deny you public education for not being vaccinated.  Ontario has reasons of conscience, and PEI tried to make them mandatory as a condition of enrollment back in 2019 or early 2020, and failed.    Of course it's just a jab.  Swab your arm, take the jab.  But it's not a fallacy to say that, once we accept that mandatory procedures for 'public health' are acceptable, that opens the door to a lot of other things.  And this isn't a slippery slope fallacy, since I can cite, within living memory, evidence of it.  We used to forcibly sterilize the mentally disabled because it was in the interest of public health.  Same for institutionalizing the mentally ill against their wills.  If we accept that government coercion, in the interest of public health, is an acceptable form of exercise of power, do you think it stops at the covid vaccine? You ever have to show your proof of influenza booster to get into a bar? How about the covid booster?  When will 2 jabs not be enough to let you go about your business?  Or the twice-daily pills Pfizer is working on?  Is that all it takes?  A convincing argument that it's in public health interest?    You know law enforcement needs a warrant to track your cell phone location data, yeah?  Think that, under a public health emergency, they'll need such things to track your locations with the vaccine passport?  ""We suspect they have covid and want to check their whereabouts for contact tracing purposes.  Oh, look, they were at this place at the same time that thing happened.""  Or what about the big database all that info sits in, tied to your health number, which is tied to your SIN?  What do you think happens when administration of that db gets privatized, and your vaccine info gets 'cancelled' if you happen to have the wrong opinion on a thing?  Private company, it can do what it wants.    There's more at play than just, 'fuck you, you selfish prick, get the vaccine.'

521,4,1631342476,"Well the main issue is that most opposing the COVID “vaccine” favor other vaccines and their reasons for refusing this “vaccine” is mainly because of key issues.   One main issue being that deaths from the vaccine, which as President Biden’s media spokesperson states, is occurring and is “being fixed”   The same administration that failed American citizens and Afghan citizens.   Another reason, is the lack of liability for manufacturers in regards to the side effects and dangers in the “vaccine”. If your vaccine continues causing health issues, including death, and if it’s failing to even prevent spread, then it’s only logical for others to refuse to get it if the virus it’s meant to protect from, is equally or less dangerous to their health.    Another reason they are against it is because of its survivable rate. For healthy individuals, long term health issues and death are highly unlikely. You have thousands of Americans and Canadians not receiving flu shots, getting the flu, and being completely fine. So obviously, the same people who already got COVID and only felt sick for a few weeks, will naturally not view it as a threat and refuse to get the vaccine.   In regards to Passports, that’s a bad idea. History clearly shows us how governments have used crisis and mandates in crisis to limit and stifle freedoms and people, a normal worry for millions worldwide rights now, especially considering governments trying to force vaccines and COVID mandates that may not be lawful.   In France and Italy for example, mass protests keep occurring because the people don’t support COVID passports.   You’re also saying you support a form of identification that can be used to prevent one from traveling, buying goods, so on so forth. Like the credit system in China, you supporting this blindly can ultimately lead to people suffering more. A passport system isn’t going to work and it’ll only serve to divide people into groups.   A more logical solution is to ease the worries of the population by solving the issues they have brought up. Holding manufacturers accountable for the side affects and showing evidence that the likelihood of side effects is rare or extreme low, after all, people get the flu shot because it doesn’t paralyze their face after one dose.    Preventing deaths from the vaccines and putting more effort into making a vaccine that’ll prevent transmission and symptoms.   So far all governments, especially Canada and the United States has done, is provide poor solutions and create more issues. Lockdowns and false words of relief that has hurt small businesses and hurt families. For example, NYC losing major resources in the form of business and the mass exodus of residents.   The division of its population and mass misinformation in regards to the positive and negatives of the virus vaccine and other solutions.    Restaurants and all kinds of employers can’t sustain their businesses with massive amounts of employees leaving due to restrictions, forced vaccine policies, and other mandates the employeess feel are unconstitutional.   In Ohio if I’m not mistaken, 26+ school bus drivers just quit in protest and others are on strike for that very reason.  In other States in the United States many doctors and nurses are actually quitting because they disagree that the vaccine and the mandates in place work.

Should everyone have to take a breathalyzer before driving, because we may think we are sober enough to drive but still be a danger.

526,4,1631217007,"I'm concerned with the false positive effect of the ""vaccine passport"".  The vaccines have been shown to lose efficacy over time; a mere six months could render a vaccinated person vulnerable to Covid 19 again.    A person vaccinated early on is not as protected as someone recently double vaxxed, yet this passport will give a false sense of security.  It creates a concept of a false wall where it is more like a slowly sinking island.    I know it is fear that drives both those who are for and those who are against the vaccine passport.  Both fears are legitimate and should be considered beyond the easily dismissed conspiracies.  Vaccines have proven effective, and should be encouraged to protect the vulnerable.  A vaccine passport does not do this.  It simply creates a divide for people who can/choose to be vaccinated and those who cannot/choose against being vaccinated.  I am finally concerned with the loss of our ability to control our personal information. Corporate tracking, data mining, and profiteering from our individual data is seemingly harmless to the individual but is having massive societal impacts. IE power players like Google and Facebook make much their money from the above methods and are increasingly influential in our political and economical climates by lobbying etc.  All forms of tracking by government and corporations should be considered invasive and detrimental to the individual regardless of it's subtle nature or positive immediate rewards.  This includes vaccine passports.  While simple and non invasive at this stage, it opens the door further for increased surveillance and individual losses (are you profiting from your data being used? You should be).  A comparison.  When the Europeans came to North America, they found groups of Indiginous people living on lands that were rich beyond what those inhabitants truly even understood.  While the European explorers and pioneers may also have had a dim view of the land, they were still able to bargain for the land (in some cases steal, but that's not the useful comparison here) with mere trinkets and items useful for the Indigenous people at the time.  Both thought they were getting a good deal (let's assume, as I'm sure there were many different opinions on it even then).  The Indigenous believed that the land was of value, but not usable to them, where the guns and metal certainly had immediate value.  We are the Indigenous peoples.  We are being exploited and our data is being taken from us in exchange for trinkets and apps (much like the one I'm using).  We are getting shortchanged in this deal.  We should recognize the massive value of our individual and collective data and demand the royalties deserved and have more say in it's use for profits.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/pkycti/vaccine_passport_or_immunization_record_why/hc7yeyc/

The only limitations are for places where the removal of a mask indoors is anticipated (gyms, restaurants, theatres.)

It's for additional, *fun* tasks that, again, aren't a right to anyone.   (Also that doesn't take into account that many grocery stores offer pick-up options in their parking lots - such as some No Frills and Walmarts.)  The difference between the flu and the covid pandemic is that the flu has a far lower hospitalization and death rate (including the fact that the application of masks in general society reduced the number of flu cases in hospital to practically zero.)  And while 'most' hospitals are handling things better now than they were earlier on in the pandemic, that doesn't mean they always will - look at Alberta and the other Western Provinces. The majority of people there have been vaccinated, but they're bringing in nurses from different provinces because their hospitals are very quickly becoming overwhelmed - and the majority of those cases are from the unvaccinated.

Since the passport has been put into place, I feel appropriately safer, so about ~2% safer. 2% less risk of catching this disease which won't kill me because I'm young/healthy/vaccinated. If I wanted to be completely safe I'd stay home. Preventing a small part of the population from accessing places that don't cause outbreaks because they're a bit less likely to transmit the virus than vaccinated people is not a fantastic solution. It will not significantly impact the pressure on the healthcare system.  If you support the passport, you either believe it will help (in which case show me *your* numbers) or you support it because you think we need to punish unvaccinated people out of morality (in which case... Wtf).",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/pixwrb/singh_pushes_for_national_covid19_passport/hbuuopo/

I mean saying ""if you don't get vaccinated, you are at much higher risk of serious illness or death from covid"" could count as a threat, but I think almost everyone agrees that sort of thing is fine to tell people.  Stuff like the vaccine passport is less clear, I'll agree. For me a big reason why I'm ok with them is because they don't restrict you from anything essential. Like you can get groceries, pharmacy, go see your doctor, etc .. In Ontario, you can even dine on a patio. So the restrictions are very limited and are just nice-to-have activities.  I would have preferred if the vaccine passports were tied to key health metrics, so that they are only used when covid spikes, basically as an alternative to a lockdown. But if cases/hospitalizations/ICU are low, we would open up from a lockdown, and similarly I think we should not use the passports at those times of lower risk. But that's not how it's going to be done.  I would strongly opposes something like keeping a child out of school if they aren't vaccinated (once they are eligible). Only if that was really the only way to keep the other kids safe, but it's not, for example we can give that kid a rapid test twice a week (or even everyday if we want to). Not being allowed to attend school is too great a harm imo.  And yeah, I meant everyone who can get vaccinated should. Obviously I don't expect kids to get vaccinated until it's approved by health Canada. And there is a very small number of people that have heart conditions that apparently prevent them from getting it. I am glad that Ontario is being strict about medical exemptions.

If a business is letting people do whatever, then THAT is the problem, it's not an excuse to justify the passport.  This is just one story. Look at the numbers. There are tons of stats depending on the specific province and where you look exactly, but the obvious trend is that long-term care homes, hospitals, workplace, daycare and schools represent an overwhelming majority of the outbreaks. The places where the passport will be enforced (restaurants, bars, gyms) are a tiny portion.  You say that coupling your passport to your gym membership is a ''minor inconvenience'' as if the 2 minutes it takes is *what* people have against the passport. That's disingenuous. It's all the rest, and you might disagree with it, but it's not that people are too lazy to show a code once, you know that.  You say it will greatly protect the members. I doubt that. Run the numbers yourself. A virus that spreads pretty well amongst vaccinated + 87% eligible population vaccinated already + passport leaving out the unvaccinated in businesses that cause very few outbreaks + ignores the percentage of unvaccinated people who just stay home/can't go out + ignores the tons of loopholes/other activities they can gather in + ignores the fact that a vaccine proof means nothing as opposed to a negative test result still you can still have and spread the virus.  How many fewer hospitalization is that? Why is the government not even saying a word on it, they even phrase it themselves in terms of ''reward for our effort'' and whatnot, it is not presented like a public health guideline. If you don't disagree with the passport, you should at least disagree with their lack of honesty about what it really is.  If you've been convinced that a gym is now safe *because* of the vaccine passport, you haven't thought it through enough, and you're buying into that false sense of security. No one is tested at the door, they can all carry COVID and transmit it.   Let's see: 13% of the eligible population doesn't have a dose yet. So if you're in a gym with 50 people in it, on average 6 of them would be unvaccinated. The numbers vary wildly and data is still being gathered, but it looks like the current vaccines are on average 70% effective at reducing transmission of the Delta variant (sadly it seems to be waning with time, that number is probably lower, and it's clear we're in for booster shots soon) In other words, a gym full of only vaccinated people would average around that 70% reduced transmission, a gym with those 6 unvaccinated people (0% reduced) would mean the collective number for the gym would fall to 61.6% reduction. So 70% to 61.6% risk. That is not the kind of change that would make me go from feeling unsafe to feeling safe in a place. The fact that I'm young healthy and vaccinated is what is.   If you actually back the passport because you think it will be *effective* and impact the numbers, and not just that it's a measure to punish a group and reward another, tell me your predictions. How much do you think it will improve the impact on the healthcare system, which is supposedly the whole point of the measures in the first place, although the language recently used by the government says otherwise.

I would advocate a more targeted approach (for example here in Ontario we closed all small businesses and gyms, even though they didn’t account for any meaningful spread, yet did nothing to crack down on capacity limits, social distancing, etc that were huge issues in box stores, warehouses, etc., and did next to nothing to address our LTC homes, which saw the vast majority of deaths early on.   I’m vaccinated, but staunchly against this passport, as I see it as a huge overstep from the government (putting on my tinfoil hat, I don’t see it being rolled back).   Depending on the province, but generally speaking Canada has pretty good vaccination rates even without the passport, so I think our hospitals will be able to fare considerably better this year. I am pretty critical of the Ontario government chronically underfunding our healthcare, which has exacerbated this issue, but there’s not much to be done in the immediate on that front.   At the end of the day, we can’t keep shutting down society, and need to learn to live with covid. A part of that is to get away from the daily case count (which just stokes unnecessary panic and fear), increase focus on promoting healthy lifestyles, and implement meaningful changes that will actually impact covid deaths (ex.

Keep in mind I'm vaccinated, I just don't want to support that kind of screening for basic tasks. My problem is if those vaccine passports are universal, or required to cross provincial borders or participate in public life, meaning that there is effectively a two-tiered society where the unvaccinated are closer to prisoners than the vaccinated. The people who will be most affected are the poor, if groceries stores require passports and they can't afford to order out every meal.  As to the hospital thing, most hospitals are handling things a lot better now that most people have gotten vaccinated. I don't think that the threat of mutation is a reason to have mandatory vaccinations or a soft mandate through widespread vaccine passports though.

Our measuring methods for obesity is also not the best measure - a bodybuilder who eats well and exercises regularly with a bmi of 30 does not equate to an inactive person with the same bmi and much higher body fat percentage and eats fast food all day.   All in all I think a bmi passport would be much too difficult to implement due to the complexities of obesity and the lack of a quick and simple way that would work for everyone to fix it. For example, do we do mandated exercise and diets? Everyone’s bodies work so differently in terms of losing weight, on top of that a weight loss program for a very very obese person would look very different for a slightly obese person.  It is just way too much effort for both the government and the public to implement this.   I mean if there was a vaccine proven to decrease hospitalizations from covid by causing people to magically become not obese, I would probably be in favour of a passport for it. Hell, i think if there was a vaccine like this, people who are obese would probably be lining up for it and we wont even be having this discussion.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/pi5vcn/keeping_the_unvaccinated_at_bay_wont_aid_the/hbpiz0x/

The average cost to our health care system for a stay in the hospital over COVID is around $23,000 ([source](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/covid-hospitalization-costs-23-000-per-stay-four-times-as-much-as-average-cihi-1.5361631)).

634,4,1630708921,"&gt; Who the fuck is talking about rewarding drug addicts - aside from you?  Did you not understand what I said? It was pretty simple.  There are many people who support giving drug addicts free drugs  on the grounds that it's better and cheaper than having them commit crimes or putting them in prison, even though it rewards them for committing crimes.  However many of those people are also here opposing paying people to get vaccinated, on the grounds that it rewards people who didn't get vaccinated (until now).  Therefore, those people who hold both beliefs are hypocrites and therefore makes them automatically wrong, since having hypocritical arguments necessarily makes at least one (or both) argument wrong.  &gt;In the long term? Absolutely.    ....  You literally said that a vaccine passport wouldn't cost taxpayers money. I pointed out it would actually cost a lot of money, hundreds of millions in fact. And then you double down and insist it actually doesn't cost any money. Listen to yourself.  &gt;Vaccine passports will slow the spread, encourage people to get vaccinated, and allow us to get a better handle on covid compared to doing at all - which is what handing out $100 bills amounts to.  Let's say hypothetically then that no one gets vaccinated and thus no one collects the $100. Then the cost is very small.  On the other extreme say literally every unvaccinated and eligible Albertan got the vaccine and collected the $100. That would only be 1.29 million people, which would cost $130 million, plus a nominal amount for the administration costs of sending them the money. That's a lot of money, but it comes with *literally all eligible Albertans* getting vaccinated.  So which is it? Either no one's going to get the money therefore it won't be a waste of money, or enough people are going to get it that it will cost a lot of money.  &gt;Estimates in Alberta alone are that the peak of this 4th wave could hit 1,500 hospitalizations, and you want to bitch about $1billion being spent across country to try to prevent this?  &gt;Talking about fucking ignorant.

With the vaccine showing remarkable resiliency against transmission, infection severity, and care required – the only problem now is infection among the unvaccinated.   To that end, provincial governments are now moving to isolate the unvaccinated to help mitigate spread and limit both rising cases and care requirement.   Part of this is by limited all non-essential group activity, where transmission has proven to be the highest. This also means masks in stores and shared spaces, etc.  The idea of the vaccine passport is both carrot and stick for any future ""lockdown"".

Does it affect you if other people do or do not wear their seatbelt? Of course not.  The vaccines are to ensure that if YOU do get sick, you don't become so sick as to require extensive medical support, potentially taking it away from others who need it.  As for the seatbelts, your not wearing your seatbelts can directly impact your passengers (this is not a pun) if you become the projectile inside the vehicle.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;What happened to medical privacy? We ask everyone about their vaccination status, but would you ask a woman if she's had an abortion? Would you ask strangers what medications they take? Or if they've contracted STDs?  The only thing that is revealed by the vaccine passport is whether you have been vaccinated.  It does not reveal any other aspect of your health.  Also, when I travelled internationally, I was asked to show my vaccination booklet, which had more information than does this vaccine passport.  The rules were - to gain access, you had to have proof of the required vaccinations.  No proof, no access to anything.  This is much less intrusive, limiting access to public venues with significant public presence (hence higher possibility of tranmission).  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;there's no reason to believe a vaccine passport ends here. If we decide that public or private sectors have the right to know our vaccination status for the safety of others, **why stop at covid? Why not ask for the vaccines for other diseases?**  Because we're dealing with an aerosolized virus that's extremely infectious.  Other diseases are generally insect or water-borne.  Those are controlled by other means.  No business wants to limit its customer base, but certain diseases (like the delta variant of Covid-19) has too great a potential impact on people.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;...it's time we go back to our common senses, and allow for the business owners, and the free market to decide how we operate....

As part of the privilege of owning a business and making money with it, every business owner is obliged to follow the rules (financial, tax, contract, safety, consumer, etc.).  Failure to do so can allow the government to dissolve the corporation.  Failure to follow the rules (of health) has forced the closure of restaurants, food producers, etc.  You seem to have little understanding of how business works.

723,6,1630297162,"While I understand the argument that the ""best"" healthcare worker would be one that is less likely to make you sick - we have to consider that we generally do not promote that employees take actions that effect them outside of work as a pre-requisite for them to continue their employment. The example I like to use is forcing a pregnant women to have a abortion to maintain her employment - because her disappearing from the work-force is a detriment to the workplace. Its optimal in many ways but no one would ever try to enforce such a thing and we have court support that clearly determines that it is her choice and that if her employer were to terminate her for her health choice - they would be in trouble.  That being said - I am curious how much actual resistance is coming from the healthcare sector - I would trust them to possibly be more informed regarding COVID then your average redditor.  As for the vaccine passport thing - to me it strikes me as just another piece of documentation - that being said if it becomes a requirement to do...pretty much everything then I understand fighting it because we don't want to create divergent societies. I admit I am skeptical with the insane level of zeal I see around COVID vaccination - especially as the ""facts"" regarding it shift constantly which makes me even more concerned that the science is shakier then it looks at first.  I am waiting for my doctor to give me the go ahead then I will likely go with the Johnson and Johnson shot and be done with it - but I will grow more concerned the more insistent folks become to get it and even more so if it becomes ""mandatory"" given its relative ""new"" nature. That being said I do not trust the pharmceutical companies who DO have a interest in permanent cycles of vaccination and a history of putting themselves before their clients and as such I do NOT trust the statement that there is no risk of long term effects - so while I will likely get the shot when the time comes - I will fight for my children to have the choice - heart issues run in my family and permanent damage to a child is something no parent would want; its a risky proposition because you also have to consider a child might die from COVID - though those statistics appear infinitesimally small.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/pe5ok1/thousands_march_in_montreal_against_mandatory/haw31hl/

739,1,1630098981,"&gt; So what exactly is the target we need to hit with vaccinations that instituting a vaccine passport would bump the numbers up to said target?  Mathematically, the number of people we need to vaccinate to reach herd immunity is inversely proportional to a virus's reproduction rate. Example, if R = 4, we need to vaccinate 3/4 (75%) so that 1 person only infects 1 instead of 4, which brings R down to 1 (the threshold where cases can no longer rise). If it's 5 we need to vaccinate 4/5, etc.   It's estimated that the R for ""original"" COVID was about 2, so 50% vaccination would have got us there. For ""alpha"" it was about 4, so 75% would have got it. For delta it's estimated to be about 7, so we need to vaccinate 6/7, or 86% (of the *entire* population).   These rates are estimated in a scenario with ""normal"" social interactions; things like social distancing can bring R rates down. So if we want cases under control, we can either continue with restrictions forever, or aim for an 85% overall vaccination rate, which probably means more like 95% of eligible adults.   The good news is that we probably don't need to get quite there; the vaccines are so protective against hospitalization that as long as the pool of unvaccinated people at risk for hospitalization is low enough, our system won't be overburdened. Right now though, that pool is still too large.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/pcvf5g/ontario_to_institute_vaccine_passport_system/halul7f/

If having a vaccine passport or a recent negative COVID-19 test are taken as equivalent, then I think that would be all right. However, that's conditional on COVID-19 tests being free (or not cost-prohibitive/subsidized) and accessible.  I also think it matters greatly what this is applied to as well. I think limits on international travel is fine. That's already heavily restricted and regulated, and it's a transition point between separate systems and responses. Access to surgery and advanced medical care can make sense as well, since there is a need to limit the spread of disease in those environments. And, if a private business chooses to require a vaccine passport or negative test to protect their employees or business, then that might be reasonable. Those people have a freedom of choice in who they interact with as well, excepting protected characteristics, but allowing for reasonable accommodation. For something like a pool or movie theatre or a concert, it might make people more confident in attending. But for something like a grocery store or hardware store, that would very much inhibit someone's ability to live.

A lot of the push back seems to assume that the case would be ""vaccine passport or zero access"", thereby completely removing unvaccinated people (for whatever reason) from parts of society. I can't imagine that could be the case, as it seems like it would be very much unconstitutional.  I would also expect private businesses would be able to request proof of vaccination or recent negative COVID-19 test or provide accommodation, but that seems like it should be their freedom of choice to do so or not, for their business and employees.

Though, you do realize if 15% of people aren’t vaccinated, that leaves us with three groups. Medical reasons (that is perfectly valid), children (temporarily), and lastly, unvaccinated for their own personal reasons, but possibly not valid ones.  That means. The true numbers of people unvaccinated for the 3rd reason, is actually most likely tiny (especially in B.C, with a population of 85% with their first dose) statistically. Because, not many people have a large percentage of health issues to where they would fall in that category. People with valid medical reasons aren’t going out. Secondly the children are *ONLY* temporarily. So once again, the true number of unvaccinated, as you recall them: “who refused” would be mere.   My point is, the government contradicted themselves. They stripped the rights of the unvaccinated. Where Covid highest spreads, is usually in close proximity, and that means events like parties, and so forth. Once the ridiculous Covid passport comes into play, that means it’s Vaccinated amongst Vaccinated.  So my point is, why would you mask the vaccinated, when they throughly push the blame on the unvaccinated, for “stopping society from going back to normal” if the vaccines are the true answer, and push they’ve been saying.  My TL;DR to you once again is. The goverment doesn’t know what they’re doing. They don’t know “how to flatten the curve” as they falsely promised for over a year now. Mandating masks, contradicts everything they’ve been pushing media wise, and now they won’t have a scapegoat.  You’re missing the point.   And yes - I’m aware of vaccinated people can the virus, but if vaccinated people are amongst the vaccinated, and the unvaccinated are to be blamed. They won’t be anymore, so it’ll be vaccinated spreading it to vaccinated at this point, which once again contradicts their push for vaccines and action. If the vaccine is all that true, and our problem solver (black and white) the mandates for masks wouldn’t be needed. Vaccinated won’t be around to be giving it to the vaccinated who want to go party.   This is what I’m arguing.

I think obesity passports are needed. Obese people are a burden on society.  The obesity epidemic was what really drove this pandemic. 80% of hospitalizations and 95% of deaths were classified as having poor metabolic health. COVID was rocket fuel on the obesity epidemic dumpster fire. Not to mention vaccines are less effective on the obese and evidence shows they shed more virus as they have higher viral loads for longer periods of time.   So while we are mandating vaccines and passports we should also be outlawing the sale of foods that contribute to this issue.  No more junkfood sales of any kind. Oreos, Doritos, candy, chocolate bars, French fries, McDonalds, Coca-Cola, sugar....etc. These should all now be illegal substances.   The only foods that are allowed to be sold are whole foods. Meat, fruits and vegetables. Just like grandma used to eat.   Healthy weight people will be issued a passport that allows them to re-enter the public and free to do what they please.  Unhealthy obese people that are more likely to burden the Healthcare system and ICUs will be allowed to re-enter society once they reach their health metric targets.

In Ontario each day the numbers are released they tend to indicate that, out of positive cases, approximately 1 out of 4 (or 5 depending on the day) positive cases are still among vaccinated individuals. This is still a rather high number.  If you attend an event like a concert with thousands of people who have vaccination passports there will certainly be people with positive cases there and this new data seems to indicate that they would have no less chance of spreading covid than an unvaccinated individual.

COVID was rocket fuel on the obesity epidemic dumpster fire. Not to mention vaccines are less effective on the obese and evidence shows they shed more virus as they have higher viral loads for longer periods of time.   So while we are mandating vaccines and passports we should also be outlawing the sale of foods that contribute to this issue.  No more junkfood sales of any kind.

794,6,1629785189,"&gt;but there's also little evidence that they aren't safe (especially given how many people are now vaccinated)  You can't draw conclusions about safety based on a lack of evidence.  If anything, a lack of evidence is reason for greater caution. Vaccinating a large number of people is not a substitute for long-term data.  Vaccines normally take 10 years or more to be approved.  The testing process for the COVID vaccines were fast-tracked to within one year.  The US project to develop and distribute the COVID vaccines was officially called 'Operation Warp Speed'.  Given the unknown safety profiles of these vaccines it is paramount that the government respect patient autonomy and the right to informed consent.  It is unethical to mandate a vaccine whose risks are not known.  &gt;And yes, preventing children from accessing public spaces would be another example of a possible coercion. However, we're clearly attempting another route,  Why take a different route with children?  If the rationale for implementing the vaccine passport is to reduce the spread of infection by the unvaccinated, then surely children, who are also unvaccinated, should be banned too?  Especially given what the  Harvard study shows:  &gt;The researchers found that infected children, even those with mild or no symptoms, carried high levels of the virus in their respiratory secretions, especially in the first two days of symptoms, and that age did not affect the ability to carry high amounts of virus.

797,9,1629829540,"The core problem isn't specifically being tracked, it's that some people actually still want to be treated as citizens, not serfs. The government is not our parents, and its core function is not to force people to live in an optimized manner.  If you want to implement paper or card based passports and say that businesses can refuse someone entry if they don't show it, sure, I'm on board. As long as you promise the government will never get to use them as a mandatory lock-down measure.  But it's pretty obvious to anyone that the passports are being set up with the intention of being made mandatory for store entry the moment a lock-down needs to occur. This is not the same thing as freedom of association and would be a massive over-step where the government determines who is allowed to go to work, who can shop where, and stratifies the population based on who complies with a medical procedure that apparently does not even work well enough to insulate the population against variants with an 85%+ compliance rate.  A physical vaccine ID card would not be a bad idea, but the direction we're trending basically requires that the card be digitally verifiable if you want it to ever be good for more than just this shot. A digital vaccine card is easily disabled if someone does not get a booster shot, or if someone has a warrant, or if someone simply says something someone in power happens not to like. We have a history of abuse from cops against natives even in Canada, hilarious misuse of the emergency alert system during the shootings, and I have zero faith that disabling a digital passport would not be straight up handed to the cops within twenty years.  Digital ID also only prevents tracking if the government designs the system in good faith. Showing my ID card at a bar does not flag to the government that I am in a bar, and purchasing alcohol does not inform the government that I am in a liquor store. A digital ID that is verified will pretty much instantly inform the government every time you try to buy liquor, any time you shop at a store that is not preferred, which could be pulled by prosecutors or police who are looking for any reason to mess with you. Yes, potentially we could catch some criminals for it, but when we have an insanely large repository of events and people all catalogued in a central database for the police they can basically pick whoever they want to fuck with and bust them for \*something\*. The power a digital passport would hand to the government is stronger than even any monitoring the Chinese government currently does.  I have a cell phone, and it is trackable, but it's trackable by an entity that must be subpoena'd to access the data. I can also just leave it at home. Your mandatory passports reporting to a central government repository are not the same. They are a hop and a skip away from a social credit orwellian nightmare the moment the government decides to act in bad faith.  We've got 85% vaccination rates, one of the best in the world, we're at the tail end of COVID. We got through the worst of it with masks and stay home orders. The government might be good dudes or may implement these items in a perfectly reasonable way, but we also just straight up don't need the passports. You're fear-mongering your way into handing the government all of the keys to unreasonable levels of population monitoring because we have \~15 deaths a day among \~35 million people, 65% of which are statistically above the average life expectancy to begin with.

The difference comes in with how likely someone is to catch it, and how long someone is contagious for.  Let's say out of that 15,000 people attending, half are vaccinated and half are unvaccinated. Let's also say 10% were infected at some point in the week ahead of the event - again half of them vaccinated, and unvaccinated.  That means 750 infected vaccinated, and 750 infected unvaccinated within the 7 days before the event.  For simplicity sake let's say that the infected individuals create a 25% chance of spreading it to the people around them - and continuing with the 50/50 theme half of those are vaccinated, and half are unvaccinated. That's 4.5 vaccinated, and 4.5 unvaccinated (decimals will work out in the end).  At a 25% chance of spreading it, the unvaccinated individuals would stand to spread the virus to 1.125 unvaccinated individual around them. This would be a total of 844 new infections.  However [because having the vaccine halves your chance of catching it](https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/08/04/fully-vaccinated-half-as-likely-to-catch-delta-covid-variant-and-less-likely-to-infect-others-study-finds/), there is only a 12.5% chance for them to spread it to the *vaccinated* individuals around them. This results in 422 new infections.  **Those are for the 750 unvaccinated individuals infected within 7 days of the event. They would lead to a total of 1,266 new cases.**  For the 750 vaccinated individuals, [we know that their period of being as contagious is less than half that of the unvaccinated](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/08/11/covid-transmission-among-vaccinated-unvaccinated-what-experts-say/5488398001/). This means out of the 750 who were infected in the 7 days ahead of the event, half no longer carry those high viral loads.  So of the 750, now only 375 would have that high spread risk.  Using that same 25% chance of spreading it, these vaccinated individuals would spread the virus to 1.125 unvaccinated individuals around them. This would be a total of 422 new infections.  And again because the vaccine halves your chance of catching it, that 12.5% chance in *unvaccinated* individuals results in 211 new infections.  **Those are for the 750 vaccinated individuals infected within 7 days of the event. They would lead to a total of 633 new cases.**  Even with 50% of the people around the unvaccinated being vaccinated, the unvaccinated individuals spread it at a rate of 168.8%.  And even with 50% of the people around the vaccinated being unvaccinated, the vaccinated individuals spread it at a rate of 84.4%.  This highlights the clear risk that the unvaccinated represent in spread the virus.  **For a final example, let's look at the rate we'd see with a vaccine passport.**  All 1,500 infections would have occurred in vaccinated individuals, and all the 9 people around them would be vaccinated.  Since the viral load is high for half the time in the vaccinated, only half of them run the risk of that 25% spread. And since the vaccinated have half the chance of catching the virus, that's only a 12.5% chance to spread.  The result is 750 contagious individuals who go on to spread it to 422 people. That is a spread rate of 56.3%.  This is why getting the vaccine matters, and why vaccine passports in high transmission areas would slow the spread.

That's the issue I have, people feel like since it's *something against the virus* it's purely innofenssive and nothing new and anyone against it MUST be some anti-authority jerk.  I have literally 0 issues with the COVID vaccine being added to the list of required vaccine for your kids to go to school or travel to certain countries.  The vaccine passport being used within the borders will have very little impact on the spread of the disease. It will not ""end this whold covid bullshit*.   With such a high percentage of the population vaccinated already, there is not that much left we can realistically convince, and simple deterents like this don't work fantastically. There won't be a world of difference between say, an 80% and an 85% vaccinated population. Even a 100% vaccinated population within the country wouldn't end COVID, we'd need to vaccinate the whole world.  We also have a virus that now spreads pretty well through vaccinated people anyway (although gladly they don't get as sick), we will eventually need booster shots/a different vaccine.  The passport has a very limited amount of outbreaks it could prevent since outbreaks rarely happen in the sectors it will be implented in (restaurants/bars/theatres/etc.) This is not to say the passport will have zero effect, but it is small enough to not be worth the downsides in my view.  It is a costly, intrusive, and innefficient measure. Saying this does not make me anti-vax or a conspiracy nut or whatever else. It's just my observation. While asking for vaccination records for school and travel wouldn't be anything new, mandating *private* businesses to demand a piece of someone's healthcare records to simply enter their business would be. Even more unusual if you consider that this proof of vaccination is neither a proof you don't currently carry COVID or that you won't transmit it to someone there.   I would have significantly fewer issues with the government, for instance, offering private businesses to opt in or out of the passport thing. Or better yet, offer to pay for rapid COVID tests for businesses so they can ACTUALLY evaluate if someone entering their store is an outbreak waiting to happen or not.  I will not go whatsoever into the idea that this is a tracking system and a government conspiracy or what have you, but it does *needlessly* add a layer of identification and segregation that CAN be exploited by governments. If not this one, maybe a future one. It is very likely such a system would last a really long time, or even be applied to other diseases or other things. Not all of which ypu might agree with, even if you said ""yes"" in the case of COVID vax.

826,2,1629441774,"Another elephant in the room is the blind assumption that a vaccine passport will act like some magical barrier against others' risky social behaviours. But it won't, especially given the transmissibility of the new variants.  E.g. a fully-vaccinated person who goes to crowded clubs/concerts/stadiums every weekend and only wears a mask when legally required will always have a higher risk of contracting and spreading COVID than an unvaccinated person/couple who spends the weekends at home watching TV, wears masks in stores, and never goes into dense crowds.  The same goes for fully-vaccinated people who spend dozens of hours per week in physical contact with unvaccinated, school/daycare-attending children. It would be inhumane not to play with one's kids, but to blindly assume like many have for the last 18 months that children aren't an obvious disease vector is ridiculous. They catch and spread it just like anyone else, particularly with delta.  So, even if vaccinated, these are two very high-risk groups that will never be as safe to interact with as people who, vaccinated or not, socially distance and wear masks outside their home. While vaccines greatly reduce the odds of catching and transmitting COVID, so many vaccinated people's behaviours can instantly reverse those odds (and how), to everyone's peril. Vaccine passports won't do a single thing about that except lull everyone into a false sense of confidence.   Now, some things could help to fill this gap, like behavioural questionnaires for entry to workplaces, or mandatory COVID tracking apps at all public venues. But vaccinated people would flip their shit if they were actually held as accountable for their risky post-vaccination behaviour as they want unvaccinated people to be.

In the US, they've been making it sound like hospitals were having a lot more children due to the Delta variant, using that to drive up vaccination rates, while it's actually RSV cases that are increasing these rates as covid was and still is not dangerous to children. According to the CDC, RSV puts on a normal year over 50,000 kids aged 5 and less in hospitals, those are normally considered acceptable numbers but this year, we know how much panic that will cause, especially as the rebound drive higher numbers. By the way, Australia has already experienced that significant RSV rebound last year which is why it was obvious that it'd be happening here as well, and the same thing is happening, cases are increasing way earlier than normally expected, as if losing herd immunity shifted the usual seasonal wave a couple months early.  I'm pretty sure more lockdowns will be coming.

If the federal government thinks they can just keep restricting everyone in contravention of the constitution they are going to have a fight on their hands. Legal, and probably eventually physical. No one is going to put up with perpetual restrictions. Not to mention the talk about forcing people to get vaccinated or reducing their constitutional rights based on vaccination status. I may not agree with some of my family members on their vaccination decision but I will defend their rights to participate in society. As far as I'm concerned, they take the risk on themselves by not being vaccinated and them along with all the other unvaccinated people and the vaccinated alike can participate together in society. I mean, it's the unvaccinated who need to worry, we who are vaccinated don't need to be too worried since the vaccine is incredibly effective. So unless we're saying that we have to protect ignorant people from themselves then the whole ""vaccine passport"" thing is pretty unnecessary.

Even if I provided 'scientific evidence' you'd disregard it like you've disregarded the science of vaccines. Don't pretend like you suddenly care about facts.      Again, you can choose to act like a responsible adult, or not. If you choose not to, the consequence is that we, the responsible adults, will keep that portion of the population that is the now the vector for transmission, from interacting in anything except the most basic manner. Much like we do with children by limiting what they do and not letting them go off and do what ever because they can hurt themselves and others.      If you people started acting like adults, we wouldn't need to treat you like the spoiled brats you are.

870,18,1629053362,"There’s a lot to unpack here. The truth is being vaccinated makes you already protected from the virus, and vaccine passports are more of a way of protecting unvaccinated people.    That said, vaccine records are a healthcare record, and businesses should not have access to it. A lot of businesses don’t take health cards as ID (note: some still do) just to avoid this bit of complication.     Now the argument is COVID is a different beast and should get a different treatment. While I don’t disagree, I’m more concerned about the government’s implementation. If they can barely get CERB right, how am I supposed to expect a proper implementation of a vaccine passport? There are so many potential issues with a vaccine passport, eg tracking our activity, leak of personal information (because a software built in a hurry is at a much higher risk of security breach), but also opens the door to further use of government enforced identification. Do we start asking for proof of travel so we can guarantee you might not have Ebola (lysogenic so not yet symptomatic)? Do we ask for proof of no consumption of chicken in HK in case of HxNx virus? It’s a slippery slope.    What it needs to be is a temporary measure. The measure needs to have an end date defined from the start, with no ability for extension.

The unvaccinated are providing a means for the virus to incubate and mutate, possibly into variants that are vaccine resistant. In 6 months we could be where we were a year ago, searching for a new vaccine to counter a new variant of the virus.  A vaccine passport protects people who have been vaccinated, and allows them to get on with their lives, back to some semblance of normal.

Nevertheless, insults are just an emotional response to a lack of argument, so please find below my answer.  The yearly lethality of the flu is 9 thousand people per year, and we do not require a flu passport. Given that the current lethality is 15 thousand per year for COVID, it would make sense to say that if COVID lethal cases decreased to the same numbers as the seasonal flu, we shouldn't have a vaccine passport.   As for the vaccine itself, the rate of vaccinated vs unvaccinated for current cases has to justify the proposed COVID passport. This ratio has to be a well determined, and accepted so that we have a measure to remove the passport when it is no longer necessary. I am not a legislator, so my proposals do not hold the same scrutiny.   We can go by the current number of people currently in hospitals in Ontario, as this information is easily available. We would need to determine our metric on this.   &gt;https://covid-19.ontario.ca/data  We can either take all cases, cases hospitalized or cases in intensive care. I would argue that we should look at intensive care for this metric, as the vaccine should be decreasing severe complications, but at the moment of me looking up the page there are no unvaccinated people in ICU, 7 partially vaccinated and 5 fully vaccinated people. It seems to me that this data is not representative. So we can look at either hospitalization with ICU together (32,44,11) where the unvaccinated represent 37% of all cases, which still seems way too low. Finally we can count all cases (234,32,58), which takes us to 72%, but at this point we are ignoring the whole purpose of the vaccine.  You can take other data, but it seems the current percentage being presented is around 70% unvaccinated cases. Once again, I would strongly argue to only look at severe cases, as that is the promoted reason for the vaccine, but we can use all cases as well.  So we have 30 to 70 currently which justifies you saying that the unvaccinated should be forced to have different measures from the vaccinated. I think this is very low, but we can allow even for that. Say we go to 50 to 50, would you still support restrictions on people who didn't take the vaccine even if the cases are equal ?

If cases spiral out of control in Toronto, should Thunder bay have the same restrictions? No. Nor should a Covid passport be required there. But in hard hit areas it should, and should be a temporary implementation to fight an ongoing major outbreak, in my opinion. Instead of punishing everyone across the province.    I'm not doubting Dr Hinshaw. I'm doubting her colleagues. There are leaks that say she doesn't really have much of a say in the matter. After all, would you vote the hand that pays you, when people that opposed Kenny have been let go or resigned?   And I agree, we don't need 0 cases, we need low hospitalizations. But if we go into this blind, we might have a worse situation on our hands.   And yes, if the provincial government can make a drinking age different, it can require a vaccine passport to be used in its borders as well. Trudeau has said it is up to the provinces to decide.   In my personal opinion, vaccine passports should be used for a targeted set of restrictions on a hard hit region by Covid. So we can have some amount of normal life, not go into full lockdown, and remain safe.  But, hindsight is 20/20, and we will know what was the right option, and what was wrong after this is all over.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/p32tqn/provinces_divided_on_making_use_of_covid19/h8oq4kg/

To me, the passport system makes sense because it allows businesses to remain open and would hypothetically create less of a strain on the Healthcare system and would be cheaper overall.  Government already has its hands in how businesses operate because otherwise, business would pass operating costs onto society instead of paying them themselves.

Excerpted the press release in the dog days of summer:  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Canadians are looking for a more reliable and secure way to demonstrate their COVID-19 vaccination history to foreign and Canadian border officials. To that end, the Government of Canada is collaborating with the provinces and territories to develop a proof of vaccination that will facilitate cross-border travel, while reducing the risk of spread and importation of COVID-19. We are also continuing to engage with Indigenous partners across the country to ensure that a proof of vaccination credential responds to the needs and rights of Indigenous peoples.   &gt;   &gt;The Government of Canada is working with provinces and territories to develop a secure pan-Canadian approach. This plan is based on advice from our public health officials with priority placed on the safety and security of all Canadians.   &gt;   &gt;For Canadians who decide to travel, using a proof of vaccination will provide foreign border officials with the vaccination history needed to assess whether a traveller meets their public health requirements and provide a trusted and verifiable credential for when they return home.   &gt;   &gt;Travellers will be able to submit their proof of vaccination in ArriveCAN (mobile app or Canada.ca/ArriveCAN) when coming back to Canada. While the focus is on a digital proof of vaccination, we will also make sure that these documents are accessible for all Canadians who may need to use them.  All of the above to say that ""We're still working on it and in the meantime don't forget to use ArriveCAN when coming to Canada.""  Nary a mention of an actually usable federally-backed certificate for Canadians to use when trying to enter other countries.

In fact it's been a habit of mine for years to put my vaccine booklet in my luggage while traveling even domestically, just because it's a good idea.  So what am I trying to hide, exactly?  I've never had to actually produce my vaccine booklet for anything other than travel to some parts of Africa where Yellow Fever is still an issue, though.  &gt;I understand people want to keep other medical issues private, but why vaccination status?  Why does it matter?  Take this for an example: a Jehova's Witness decides, on religious grounds, that they will not get the vaccine.  What should happen?  Should they be barred from public life until they violate their deeply held religious beliefs?  Another example: a person is immunocompromised and is directed by their doctor to not take the vaccine.  What should happen?  Should they be barred from public life until they put their health at risk by violating their doctor's orders?

That's another potential that we must be wary of, absolutely.  What justification can you give for not requiring proof of the annual flu vaccine?  After all, the flu kills lots of people each year as well and there is a vaccine available.  What reasoning can you provide to not require flu vaccine passports which could not also be used against covid vaccine passports?   Let's go a step further when it comes to diseases.  How about STD passports?  Why would you be opposed to revealing if you have an STD to the laundromat worker?  *If you've got nothing to hide then you've got nothing to fear*, right?  But let's go a step further and broaden this to our health and healthcare system.  How about a nonsmoking passport?  After all, smokers cost the taxpayers a staggering amount for their healthcare directly related to smoking, don't they?  How about an obesity passport?  They're even worse than the smokers in terms of cost to the healthcare system, correct?  Shouldn't there be penalties for being such a drain on society?  And what of those who refuse to mend their ways?  What solution do you propose to deal with them?  Yes, the concern for how the rules we enact now will be applied in the future, and to future generations, is absolutely a concern that any reasonable person should hold.

944,6,1628642489,"&gt; Then  why not show a QR code when you visit a bar or a restaurant as a temporary measure, even if it is just to help put other people at ease  Because doing so “to put other people at ease” is literally just virtue signaling and empathy theater.  If a person is symptomatic and he is hacking and coughing, I can understand how that may make others around him uncomfortable to be in his vicinity.  But if you feel uncomfortable being surround a perfectly healthy person showing zero indication of illness, then maybe it’s you who are overly anxious that’s the problem and not the person who is perfectly healthy showing zero indication of illness.    &gt; even if it is just to help put other people at ease and promote vaccination?  The goal shouldn’t be to promote vaccination.  The goal should be to promote societal cohesion and prevent societal collapse.  Vaccine passports deepen the societal chasm by way of segregation, two tier treatment, and “punishing” people who don’t fall lockstep with you mentally and culturally.  Vaccine passports are extremely divisive, as it literally cleaves society into two classes of people.  If the goal was increasing public health, all the vulnerable people ought to stay home.  They are mostly the ones getting infected, getting super sick, superspreading it in high viral loads to those around them via their underperforming immune systems, being hospitalized with long-term covid infections posing an elevated risk to hospital staff tasked with their care, and then dying from said covid infections. If we lock down the vulnerable only (aka targeted protection), or if we mandate 100% vaccination rate on the elderly only, we would be able to improve public health and safety dramatically.  Throwing all the non-vulnerable into the same bucket has marginal benefits at best, and comes with a far greater cost.  So why don’t we either mandate 100% vaccination of everyone over the age of 60, or mandate everyone over 60 to shelter in place until the pandemic is over?  Or at least ban anyone over age 60 from going to restaurants, salons, bars, and nightclubs?  Or, instead of demanding everyone vaccinate in order to access things like groceries stores, why don’t we demand groceries stores open up 2 hours a day (like maybe 8-10am) where they mandate masking, social distancing, never-ending sanitizing of surfaces etc, but after 10am, the store reverts to pre-covid level of free-for-all, where no on is being told to mask or socially distance.  The vulnerable and the terrorized have their chance to shop during the 8-10am sanitized hours and the rest of us can shop anytime after 10am.  Everyone has a choice in the matter, and no one is forced to cater to anyone else’s lowest common vulnerability.    &gt; The sooner everyone is vaccinated, the sooner we get our lives back to normal.  Nah.  The sooner you act normal, the sooner we go back to normal.    &gt;**If you disagree with the vaccine passport, then, to be consistent, you should also disagree with license plates...**  License plates don’t compare to an injection of a substance in your body.

953,15,1628685327,"Full text below:  ***  Unvaccinated people in Quebec will be denied access to non-essential public spaces such as bars, restaurants and gyms as of Sept. 1, the province’s Health Minister announced on Tuesday as he revealed details of the most sweeping vaccine passport policy in the country. Health Minister Christian Dubé said at a news conference on Tuesday that Quebeckers would need to scan a code on a smartphone application to get into busy public spaces, including festivals and concert venues. Employees at those businesses will not face the same vaccination requirement to avoid running afoul of labour laws, Mr. Dubé said. People from other provinces and countries will also have to use the system. The announcement continues Quebec’s record of aggressive and controversial responses to the [COVID-19](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/topics/coronavirus/) pandemic, which ravaged the province’s long-term care sector during the first wave. With its long winter curfew and early decision to delay second doses of the vaccine, Quebec has regularly staked out distinct policy terrain from the rest of the country, sometimes inspired by ideas in Europe.   The province will begin to test the passport at a Quebec City sports bar this week, the first of at least two pilot projects intended to smooth out technical issues before the formal launch in September. The system will cover all of Quebec, not just hard-hit regions as the government previously said, in response to rising case counts and the growing prevalence of the more-contagious Delta variant of the novel coronavirus. The Health Minister presented the expansive new policy as a way to prevent another round of lockdowns in a fall resurgence of the virus.   “A fourth wave is inevitable in Quebec,” he said. “The idea is to give access to these locations only to people who are fully vaccinated, instead of closing them like we have during the first three waves.” The provinces are divided over whether to require proof of vaccination for certain activities.   Internationally, vaccine passports are gaining currency. Israel, France and New York, among other places, have announced or implemented restrictions on access to at least some businesses based on vaccination status.   The government of Canada is working on a proof-of-vaccination system for international travel.   Quebec will become the third province in Canada to use a vaccine passport of some kind, after Manitoba and PEI, although Quebec’s will be the most comprehensive. Visitors to PEI can apply for a proof-of-vaccination pass to allow them to enter the province without self-isolating, while residents of Manitoba with proof of two shots can attend some large gatherings such as pro sporting events.   Other provinces, such as Alberta, say they have no plans to implement a vaccine passport program. Ontario Health Minister Christine Elliott said on Tuesday that her government will not mandate vaccinations, and individual businesses can decide whether to require them for staff or patrons. “That has always been our position – that we are not mandating vaccines, that that is something for people to choose for themselves, but we encourage people to get vaccinated,” she told reporters at a hospital announcement in Collingwood, Ont. Ms. Elliott also raised concerns that proof-of-vaccination smart cards could be subject to fraud, and said Ontario’s paper and e-mail confirmations of second doses will suffice.  Ontario’s Chief Medical Officer of Health, Kieran Moore, said at his weekly briefing that Ontario-specific vaccination passports are a government decision, but he does not think they are “absolutely necessary” now. Still, he said policies will be reviewed over time. “I don’t think any door has been formally closed, but we are achieving the goals we wanted to achieve,” he said, adding that he expects vaccination numbers to climb again in September. So far, 81 per cent of Ontarians aged 12 and up have received one dose, and 72 per cent are fully vaccinated. Dr. Moore said the province’s goal is 85 per cent to 90 per cent fully vaccinated.  Despite their different approaches, Quebec will work with Ontario to make sure qualifying residents of that province are able to use Quebec’s vaccine passport, said Mr. Dubé, noting the close links between the provinces.  Quebec also boasts high rates of vaccination, with 84.8 per cent of residents above the age of 12 having received one dose, and 72.2 per cent fully vaccinated, according to its public-health institute. The province continues to nudge reluctant Quebeckers to get their shots in creative ways – a provincial lottery open to fully vaccinated people held its first draw last week – and Mr. Dubé said he hopes the passport system will encourage uptake. “Don’t wait to hit a wall in September – go get vaccinated,” he said at his news conference, which was briefly interrupted by a protester opposed to public-health measures. Geneviève Beaulieu-Pelletier, a psychologist and associate professor at the Université du Québec à Montréal, said the passport system could help overcome some vaccine hesitancy by giving hardened opponents an excuse to get their shots while saving face. “There are people who don’t dare give up their position,” she said.

However, while at glance these macro statements hold room for questions and healthy debate.  a.  I have not seen any stats that back-up the statement that unvaxxed people are contributing to the transmission of cases.  The statement has only been ""Unvaxxed people make up majority of hospital ICU Covid patients"", which has been a testament to the fact that this COVID shot save lives.  Cases should mean nothing if the number of deaths/case is down.  The nation is over 70% vaccinated, at what threshold would you feel safe mingling around unvaxxed people?  Vaccinated become cases as well. great.  Ok, well not a big deal as long as they do not become hospitalized we are still good.  Right?  b.  My poor grammar made you assume I am likely an anti-masker.  This is incorrect.  What I meant to say is, now that we seem to be through the thick of it (ie, mask mandates lifting in my current province) we as a population still need to practice common sense and practice prevention practices (masks, stay home if sick, wash hands, etc).  Masks were made mandatory, social distancing was implemented, PPE where social distancing is not possible.  So, I do understand why and what we have been doing since day 1.  However, now at day 700 we don't need to be so vigilant - no more masks indoors etc.  Did that clear things up?   c.  *or use our healthcare service at all.*  Sad statement to read TorontoSoup.  But at least it was pretty humorous to me (I enjoy dark humour).  Seeing the burden that the healthcare system has been under for the past 30 years of my life due to complications through obesity.  COVID doesn't hold a candle to what obesity has costed the medical system, and our tax dollars).  Especially since ""*pretty much all""* major complications from COVID are found in those who are obese who are not already unwell or quite old (80+).  Would you be ok to save lives nationwide by banning big soda, high tariff on junk food, shut down fast food and mandating exercise to get our population healthy again?  I'm down for going straight to the root cause of this pandemic, and not rely booster solutions (referring to a society that is dependent on booster shots to stay ""normal"").  &amp;#x200B;  Lastly, we are getting off track regarding the vaccine passport.  This isnt just a health debate, this is also collides with personal rights and freedoms that we all have as Canadians.  There are elements of this passport that disrupt those values that we all take for granted.  We are acting like this virus that yes, although deadly to a large number is still pretty shitty at killing (it is very good at spreading though) will end the world as we know it.  If this is what is happening to our freedoms with this, what happens when something deadlier comes along?  &amp;#x200B;  We are in a constant state of fear - take the vaccine you won't die.  You also won't die from the individual who gave you COVID at the pool who's not vaccinated.  I understand my odds pertaining to statistics from this virus.

I'm from Ontario and long before COVID hit we were having discussions about ""hallway medicine"".  &gt; Every day, Ontario hospitals put nearly 1,000 patients in what the province's health ministry calls ""unconventional spaces,"" such as hallways, meeting rooms and storage areas.  Behind all those numbers are the patients affected by hospital overcrowding: waiting more than 24 hours in the emergency department before getting admitted to a bed, spending their hospital stay in a makeshift spot, such as a converted exercise room, or facing repeated delays for surgery because all post-op beds are full.  https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-hallway-medicine-hospital-overcrowding-patients-1.5443172  This was the state of our healthcare pre-covid.  And you're starting to lose me on this one.  If we can agree to some extent that the risk remains small then we should be in agreement that vaccine passports are not required.  The policy is genuinely authoritarian in nature.  The health minister has openly stated it is for the purpose of ""compliance"".  This opens up the debate to the ethics of medical coercion, which I hope we can both agree is a bad outcome.  The state should never pressure citizens into receiving medical treatment, particularly when the risk is small as we have agreed.  We need to start asking ourselves what kind of society we want to live in post-covid.  You have to be extremely vigilant in states of emergency as it is the prime opportunity for ambitious governments to further their agendas. This means calling out governments when they extend their reach too far under the guise of an emergency.  The Patriot Act signed after the 9/11 attacks is a good example of how laws enacted under a state of emergency tend to stick around. Signed in by Bush and extended thereafter by Obama. The patriot act gave the US government wide ranging surveillance powers previously unavailable to it. This is the focus of the Snowden controversy.

There are still a small percentage of people who will experience a breakthrough case even if they are fully vaccinated and become sick, but it will not be life threatening.  A vaccine passport is to prevent the normans who won’t get vaccinated from joining large crowds and gatherings, preventing the nearly guaranteed spread amongst that group of people and stopping different variants from popping up among the general population. It is a public health initiative. Your rights aren’t being taken away from you because of a vaccine passport. You can go take the shot and join the rest of the vaccinated world, or you can wait. There are private businesses who will dictate the terms and conditions on which you can enter, protecting their employees and other customers is their priority. If they say you need to be vaccinated to enter or participate in events, well that’s tough luck to the unvaccinated. The unvaccinated will have to do curb side pickup and delivery for the things they need and watch from the sidelines.  Look at the case rate now in the United States compared to the case rate last year from when lockdowns were initiated. During lockdowns, the average was +50,000 cases each day or so, but hospitalizations were exploding. Compared to now, where in the United States the average is 100,000 cases each day, hospitalizations are dramatically reduced. That is entirely due to the vaccine. This theme plays out in every single country that has a population that is vaccinated.  A vaccine passport gets us to herd immunity quicker, gets us out of this pandemic quicker, and gets us back to a semi-normal life quicker. Why should I, a person who is fully vaccinated, be stopped from going on with my life because a group of uneducated normans refuse to take the shot?

There are quite rational people...scientists, virologists, nobel prize winners, people at the top of their field or involved in the invention of MRNA technology still asking questions and the answers aren't all in.  What is happening, however, is equivalent to book burning in terms of scientific debate.  Censorship, smear campaigns, people risking their careers to ask questions. It's a concerning time in scientific/intellectual history. Make whatever choice you want, hate people for being hesitant if you want, but a certain % of people are uncomfortable while there are still gaps in the literature, and not without rational reason.      *Variants:*   Please keep in mind, that vaccinations reduce chances of becoming very ill, hospitalizations and death.  You can still get and spread covid while being vaccinated.  74% of individuals in this sample were vaccinated and carrying a transmittable load of Covid.  Out of a further sample of 133, 90% were carrying Delta.   Yes, non vaccinated people will typically carry higher viral loads, but please consider some nuance in your framing of non vaccinated as the only source of continued spread/variant.

However, the researchers concluded that the chance a vaccine-resistant strain will emerge is highest in a scenario that combines three conditions: First, a large portion of a population is vaccinated, but not everyone. Second, there's a lot of virus circulating. And third, no measures are in place to curb potential viral transmission from vaccinated people.   &gt;   &gt;That scenario describes several Canadian provinces right now, like Alberta and Manitoba. Country-wide vaccine passports are probably our best chance at avoiding that result... at least here in Canada.

1055,1,1626450891,"Exactly and this is why the premier of Quebec has set up a vaccination password system.  To push the undecided and lazy to get their shots.    They have done the same in France, except that it's not a vague ""only if we get a wave"", but a definite, starting on this date, a passport will be required to take the train, to go to a cafe or bar, etc.  This prompted  10,000 people to sign up to get vaccinated.  It works.  And while I don't think anyone should be forced to be vaccinated, I wouldn't agree to fines or something similar.  I compare this to smoking.  You have the right to smoke in your own house, but if you leave that house, I have the right not to breathe your toxic fumes.    And I am for mandating vaccines for workers who interact with vulnerable people.  If they are anti-vaxxers, they have the option to find a line of work that doesn't involve the same clientele.  There have been cases of double-vaccinated vulnerable people getting infected with covid and dying.  The vaccine isn't bulletproof protection.  I think our senior folks suffered enough.

1056,2,1626451505,"&gt;Vaccination passports aren't to force people to get vaccinated. People can still make that choice themselves.  First, as custom dictates, I will state that I've been fully dosed and I still think vaccine passports are dystopian BS.  Second, I'll address your statement here: Is it really honest to call something a ""choice"" when the alternative is to be ostracized from society and barred from public spaces (or at best, segregated)? I mean sure, no one is coming to arrest you for not taking the shot (yet...), but to call it a free choice is a bit disingenuous I think.  Third, leaving aside the murky ethical waters of covid 19 vaccines, I think this whole conversation (the overall public discourse, not just this comment thread) needs to be reframed. We talk about vaccine passports like some kind of isolated public health tool, instead of what they really are: social credit passes. Right now, their scope is confined to COVID and your vaccination status, but that could easily change. So, when you mull the prospect of a vaccine passport, I think you have to be honest with yourself about where you stand on the question of social credit passes in general. I can see the argument for them, but the potential for abuse is also very high as it confers a great deal of power to whoever gets to decide what is pro-social and what is anti-social behaviour.  Just my $0.02 on why some anti-passport rhetoric is a good thing! These things need to be discussed out in the open (rather than what has happened over the last year where anyone suggesting that a vaccine passport was on the way was dismissed as a conspiracy theorist).

It’s going to have an impact on businesses like movie theatres and restaurants, entertainment venues, because if there’s no way to know if the person standing beside you has been vaccinated or not who’s going to want to take the risk?

1068,9,1626399258,"Indeed, these are side effects, and they do come at a risk.  When doing the risk analysis though there is the risk to others to take into account, unless one doesn't care about them.  The side effects you just listed are very similar to those of COVID, and there are risks associated with that as well.  The common trend that seems to be occurring is it is damage due to inflammation, so things like heart damage, and even erectile dysfunction are possible outcomes.  When you factor in others, the risk profile changes.  There is so much talk about not limiting peoples activities, and how the idea of vaccine passports will create a dual class society, etc. but all these arguments are self centred and don't take into account others.  A proper vaccine passport system would not reveal any information about you, what vaccines you had, or even if you're vaccinated.  All that is needed is that you've been verified.  There are three options I can see here that could qualify:  1. You are fully vaccinated (regardless of vaccine type). 2. You can't be vaccinated due to a medical reason that is backed up by a doctor. 3. You are a conscientious objector.  When going about your business, or travelling, the only question to answer is, are you verified.  The answer should be yes or no.  Another factor is date sensitivity, but that doesn't effect the answer, it is still yes or no.  In theory, everyone can be verified by one of the three things above.  Option 3 should be the hardest to obtain, due to it being a weak point in our society, but perhaps all that is needed is a quick online course talking about vaccines and why they are beneficial and you can get verified.  As for other people.  If you are one of the unlucky few who can't get vaccinated, eg. allergies or within a group that doesn't have an approved vaccine, then you are being put at risk by others who choose to ""take their own risks"" and not get vaccinated.  When someone who can't be vaccinated goes grocery shopping, for example, they don't have the luxury of deciding for themselves if they should or should not get protected, the are forced to be unprotected.  That is why it is up to everyone else who is able to get vaccinated to do so, to reach and exceed herd immunity.  It is clear than each person is able to make their own choices about what they allow into their body, but it doesn't mean that the greater society needs to accept their choice.  They are free to not get vaccinated and they are free to exclude themselves.  It is heartless, but they are a risk to everyone.    On top of this, the vaccines aren't 100% effective, so they aren't just putting those who can't get vaccinated at risk, they are putting everyone at risk.  I'm sure that individual doesn't want to cause others harm, like _life long heart damage, nerve issues, death, and other not yet reported side effects._  It is up to all of us to work together, to the best of our abilities, to have a happy, healthy society.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/okzvdg/were_not_gonna_have_a_split_society_ontario/h5chd5e/

Ideally, we should let people travel with few restrictions once we feel comfortable with anyone traveling.

It's been showing great results so far.  &gt;Apparently you can still transmit and get infected despite being vaccinated   You can transmit it, yes, but the viral load is much weaker. The goal is to have no community spread, or maintain it at a minimum so the virus cannot spread as easily. We do this to support our healthcare system and the more vulnerable people in our population.  &gt; Why force people if at some point there won't be any clog?   To avoid future clog in the event of a resurgence. You know hospitals are supposed to treat other things than COVID?  &gt; Resurgence doesn't equal a proportional increase in hospitalization rates.

1094,4,1625773228,"I edited my comment above to provide more info (I accidentally hit post early). It is not rare for kids to catch and spread COVID, at least not now. When you see that Delta is largely spreading amongst unvaccinated people, what isn't mentioned is that most of those people are kids. In some countries they're accounting for like 1/2 of the cases. As mentioned, it has a low rate of causing MIS-C (multisystem inflammation syndrome) which can cause severe damage that will impact them for the rest of their life if it doesn't kill them. Delta is more concerning for this reason (I think Alpha also caused this but isn't super common in Canada, but the original strain of COVID largely did not).  &gt; You can't advocate for that. People should talk to THEIR doctor and determine if it's right for them. People shouldn't be taking medical advice from government officials, celebrities, online commentators or anyone other than their doctor.  Then I encourage those people to go talk to their doctor, and their doctor will almost certainly tell them that they should get vaccinated - unless they're one of those VERY small number of people who can't, or their doctor is an anti-vaxxer nutjob who doesn't care about committing malpractice (also very rare).  &gt; Not to enter restaurants, bars, gyms, etc. And not for something that isn't even a cure. The vaccine helps, but it's not a cure for anything.  I don't know about restaurants/bars etc specifically, but vaccine passports have been used to control attendance at events. They were used to control attendance at pilgrimage sites even 100 years ago which were places plague was typically spread in large numbers.  No vaccine is a cure. Polio did not have a cure, but the vaccine passports for it were used to control people's movements + registrations for school etc anyway.  We've already used vaccination documentation for school registration and schools are a public space. There's no sense in NOT using it for restaurants/bars/gyms etc. Those are private businesses that can choose to use the passport if they want, or not - but many likely will, because the majority of people are getting vaccinated and at least in the short-term many parents will not feel comfortable bringing their kids into spaces where unvaccinated people are accepted (while their kids are still unable to get vaxxed).",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/ogc0x1/covid19_quebec_will_implement_a_vaccination/h4icse8/

Your attendance at schools has been dictated by your vaccinations, so yes, it has. I'm 30 years old and I had vaccination records too. Without them, I would not have been attending public school. That's a public space -- this vaccine passport will be used for inter-provincial travel presumably, but also for private businesses, which will be able to choose whether to use it or not - but many people will not feel comfortable going into private businesses that make no effort to push people to get vaccinated.  &gt; I don't care. Taking the whole population as hostages with this ridiculous passport and using blackmail to force people to vaccinate is a slippery slope and I find it very worrying that my fellow citizens, like you, are willing to give the governement this power over us.  Nobody is taking anybody hostage. If you don't want to get vaccinated you don't have to. But it may mean not being able to go to Quebec in the near future, or go into private businesses there that choose not to let unvaccinated people in. This isn't a difference of opinion or some ideological difference - it's a vaccine, and if people choose not to take it they face the consequences. The biggest one of which is, you know, possibly catching and spreading a deadly disease.  The gov't *already* has this power over us and they mostly don't use it. They're using it in this case because it makes sense. Letting people walk around with a deadly communicable disease and spread it all over without consequences makes no sense when the vaccines are widely available to everybody who wants one (except kids under 12).  &gt; It's not about preventing travel?

They have the same rights as everybody else. **Including the right to get a vaccine at a time of their choosing for free.**  Not getting vaccinated is a CHOICE.

1119,1,1623882048,"The show must go on. But if you got the AstraZeneca vaccine, you’re not invited.  Canadians who got that shot will not, at least for now, be allowed in seats for “Springsteen on Broadway” the first production since the famous theatres went dark at the start of the pandemic.  “It’s just plain not fair,” said University of Toronto bioethicist Kerry Bowman. While the Canada-U.S. border is closed to non-essential travel, it’s expected to open soon, and though making it to a show is not a life-or-death situation, “it’s a huge problem.”  It could also be just the beginning of bureaucratic vaccine woes, as the world starts to reopen with a patchwork of different approved shots.  “From an ethical point of view it’s very difficult, because what has happened is people have made their commitment to being vaccinated for their own health and the health of their communities and the world, and people are turning their nose up at it,” Bowman said.  AstraZeneca was approved by Health Canada, but not by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. First doses have since been stopped in Ontario due to safety issues with blood clots, but many have opted to go ahead with second shots or mix with Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna.  According to a Q and A posted on the theatre’s website, guests at “Springsteen on Broadway,” an intimate show featuring The Boss performing solo starting June 26, will need to be fully vaccinated with an FDA-approved jab. That means at least two weeks days after a second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna. Or at least 14 days after the one-dose Johnson &amp; Johnson Janssen vaccine.  Guests will have to provide proof of vaccination from their health-care provider on a smartphone, or with a physical copy.  Sadly for the many GenXers who got AstraZeneca firmly in Springsteen’s demo, “at the direction of New York state only FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson) will be accepted.”  The only exception is for children under 16, who must be taken by a vaccinated adult and provide proof of a negative rapid COVID test taken within six hours of the performance, or a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test taken within 72 hours.  The theatre and the New York governor’s office did not respond to requests for comments by deadline.  The no-AZ policy touches on a larger problem, said Bowman: the lack of international co-ordination on a registry of acceptable vaccines, that will become more of a problem as countries start to open up again.  “As we roll into 2022 there’s going to be just this mosaic of different vaccine backgrounds that people have and there’s got to be an A list,” he said. “We have got to figure this out.”  AstraZeneca has been used in a number of jurisdictions, including Britain, he notes.  China and Russia have their own vaccines, which are already being used beyond their borders. Brazil is buying the single-shot Chinese vaccine, and Algeria is administering Russia’s Sputnik V, neither of which is approved by the FDA or Health Canada.  This means “people coming back into Canada who have had vaccines not recognized in Canada will have the same problem” as those barred from Broadway, said Kelley Lee, a professor and Canada Research Chair in Global Health Governance at Simon Fraser University.  “It’s a real reflection of how chaotic it’s been. Countries adopted their own travel measures when the pandemic occurred and now when they’re trying to ease them, it’s no surprise.”  The level of vaccination in different countries, as well as testing and quarantine protocols, also varies, said Lee, who noted the vaccine passport idea has been driven by industry groups “keen to get business going,” and not the World Health Organization. It will be really important to follow the “real-world data on vaccine efficacy” to know which ones work.  “We would ideally need a global system that would give everyone the same treatment in terms of their immunization status and it would be reliable and secure,” she said. “We don’t have anything like that.”  With almost 60 per cent of adults fully vaccinated, New York City is roaring back to life, well beyond Broadway, and proof of vaccination is increasingly the golden ticket to join in the fun.  Several late-night shows have opened up tapings to live audiences again, but they, too, need to be fully vaccinated. According to NBC’s website, AZ does not make the cut for “Saturday Night Live,” or “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”  New York state has also launched the Excelsior Pass, which lets you share you vaccine or negative test status on your phone with a QR code, and provides access to theatres, stadiums, and other events. For now it’s only open to those who have been fully vaccinated in the state.  Things are starting to open up, but Lee added that it’s important to recognize we’re still in a transition phase, especially globally.  “I think we need to be patient, and I think Americans are getting a little more impatient,” she said.  “I have had AstraZeneca so I guess I won’t be able to go to Broadway.”",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/o1gq4n/burn_in_the_usa_canadians_who_got_the_astrazeneca/h20sdra/

A PCR test is the most reliable diagnostic test but still far from perfect with the chances of getting a false negative ranging from 20% to 100% depending on when you had been exposed if true. For screening passengers at an airport, it's highly unsuitable because it's not ""quick"" as the interviewed CEO claims. It takes between 1-3 days to get the results in Canada.  The quicker but much less reliable test is the antigen test (different from the antibody test which is also unreliable compared to PCR). You could get results from the antigen test in as soon as 15 minutes, but the trade-off is speed for accuracy.

1146,1,1622836124,"&gt; It’s been about 14 months since the border with the U.S. was closed. The time to start reopening it has arrived. And somehow the government of Canada is not ready.  &gt; This is one of those cases where a sudden blanket measure was put in place because of an emergency and, now that there are better ways to deal with it, there is too much sleepy inertia getting in the way.  &gt; So snap out of it, Ottawa. People who have been fully vaccinated can safely travel across borders without quarantining. Govern yourselves – and all of us – accordingly.  &gt; That’s not a political opinion. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded fully vaccinated people are good to go across borders, without quarantine. Last week, Health Canada’s own Expert Advisory Panel said the same thing.  &gt; In May, the Biden Administration suggested talks on reopening, but Prime Minister Justin Trudeau played down the idea.  &gt; While Mr. Trudeau’s government is dawdling over it, two Liberal MPs, Wayne Easter and Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, banded together with a U.S. Representative from western New York State, Brian Higgins, to call for government to start phasing in a reopening of the border – starting with dropping quarantine requirements for people who can show proof they are fully vaccinated.  &gt; “We really do need to exercise greater urgency – given the evidence, given the science that we know, that it is safe for fully vaccinated individuals to travel,” Mr. Erskine-Smith said in a telephone interview.  &gt; That Canadian Expert Advisory Panel didn’t suggest dropping all border measures, but revamping to make them smarter. The recommendations notably included cancelling the mandatory three-day hotel quarantine for air travellers because it is inconsistent, inconvenient and of marginal value in preventing the spread of COVID-19.  &gt; Instead, on Thursday, the government increased the penalty for skipping out of hotel quarantine from $3,000 to $5,000.  &gt; It’s hard to imagine the hotel quarantine was ever much use, but it was implemented to beef up the blunt message the government wanted to send: Travel = Bad.  &gt; The thing is, Canada now needs to move to another message: Vaccination = Freedom.  &gt; Goldy Hyder, the chief executive officer of the Business Council of Canada, said the freedom to travel is a powerful incentive to get vaccinated. The benefit of being fully vaccinated should be the ability to travel, within Canada and abroad.  &gt; “COVID put us under house arrest. Vaccines give you mobility freedom. Or they should,” Mr. Hyder said. “What are we waiting for?”  &gt; One reason for Canada’s sluggish approach might be a political fear that opening the border to fully vaccinated people now might draw attention to the fact that, for the next month or two, there will be a lot more Americans that are fully vaccinated while Canadians are still in what Mr. Trudeau called a “one-dose summer.”  &gt; Maybe Mr. Trudeau figures it’s easier to wait till the end of August, when it will be closer to an expected fall election, too.  &gt; There are more practical concerns. There’s a question of whether a Canadian “vaccine passport” would be issued by the federal government and, if so, whether the provinces will share vaccination data with Ottawa. There’s also the issue of what documents from the U.S. and other countries would be accepted as proof of vaccination.  &gt; But surely, Ottawa should have seen that coming. If they’re not ready after all this time, they’d better get a move on.  &gt; Some European Union countries already have such documents, and international air-travel organizations are working on standard formats. Several U.S. states have their own certificates, and phone apps.  &gt; “Surely we can figure this out, as between Canada and the United States, much more quickly – given the friends, families and business interests that live across both borders, and work across both borders,” Mr. Erskine-Smith said.  &gt; Canada’s tourism sector would be better off even with just a partial reopening of the border. A little more business travel would be good for the economy, too. It’s also just a good message to send that Canada will welcome anyone who has had two shots.  &gt; “Its good for our economy, and it is good for our brand,” Mr. Hyder said.  &gt; It’s more than that. Governments have a duty to open up freedoms as much as possible when it is so low-risk. Canada’s has fallen asleep on its pandemic border policies.

None of this is a personal attack on you, but me just going through the stuff my colleagues and I have thought about from a 'mental exercise' point of view because it's a fascinating problem. Like, for example:   a) That situation I mentioned in my previous post - 1 vaccine dose in Ontario, another in the US. How does that reconcile on the passport, with both effectively being marked '1 of 2' for the same vaccine? Would you be required to explain _why_ that situation occurred?  b) Marking it on passports: Works for Canadian citizens, but what about Permanent Residents or people who were here when they got vaccinated? The same quandary would apply as a non-American were I to get my shot in the US as well? Should we expect various nationalities to go to their independent consulates/embassies to get stamped? I doubt it; this would simply overwhelm the system and cause more logjams. The organization responsible for working on making new Canadian Passports can barely handle the backlog as it now stands. This document would _need_ to be an independent piece of paper that you carried with your passport, much like the yellow/red cards for Yellow Fever, etc.  c) The vaccine rollout, in the interest of expediency, allowed pharmacies to administer the first dose of AZ. How would a validation of that work to put it on a passport, in terms of a pharmacy verifying that they did in fact give both shots? How would that hold up in the face of foreign travel?   d) The broader question of all of this is - do other countries, with their varied methods of vaccine rollout and decision-making, have the capacity to recognize and trust the authority of other countries' health organizations? Will, for example, the CDC recognize the authority of Ontario's Trillium Health Partners as being at par, for example, with someone who had their vaccinations done in India? If not, then how is that standard set?   These are just some of the issues I see with this thorny problem of Proof of Vaccinations being used for international travel.   The more I look at it, the more I come to realize that getting a global standard to work with these situations might be near impossible, given that each country had to act quickly to the evolving situation within their borders. There will necessarily need to be some 'laxity' in the initial rollout to accommodate these situations. Additionally, it might be more of a non-problem considering every country is hoping that they have a vast majority of their local population immunized fully before they 'open the gates', as it were; nullifying the effect that a few 'bad faith actors' (i.e. people with falsified papers, for example) could have in terms of triggering another COVID wave on their soil.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/ndp7sv/vaccinations_are_picking_up_is_it_time_to_reopen/gyckzz4/
1181,0,1620943168,"&gt; WASHINGTON—This week, I told U.S. Rep. Brian Higgins that when it comes to the state of discussions about reopening the Canada-U. S. border, officials at the negotiating table are being very quiet.  &gt; “I think you’re being generous. I don’t think there is a table. I don’t think anybody’s at it. Therein lies the problem.”  &gt; So yeah, if you were thinking about a vacation in the U.S. this summer — or of having relatives who live down south come visit you — maybe come up with a Plan B.  &gt; Higgins, the co-chair of the U.S. Congressional Northern Border Caucus, represents Western New York, where frequent cross-border travel is both a way of life and a linchpin of the economy. When I spoke to him earlier this year, he was advocating a plan to possibly loosen restrictions on border travel by Canada Day or July 4, or at least to have some guidelines in place about when, how and under what circumstances reopening might take place. This week, tens of millions of vaccinations later, he was suggesting September as a new possible date to shoot for. Even on that, he didn’t sound particularly optimistic.  &gt; “A public health crisis can be managed and at the same time, you can begin to lift some restrictions,” Higgins said of his position that the definition of “essential travellers” should be expanded, possibly with some sort of vaccine requirement. “If you wait for this to be eradicated, the border’s never gonna open again.”  &gt; The border has been closed to most travellers since March of 2020. Since then, there have been almost monthly stories full of expert speculation about how and when a phased-in reopening plan might come. All along, these have been accompanied by no official word other than a monthly announcement that the current restrictions have been extended another month. Expect another extension announcement next week. And then probably another one a month after that.  &gt; A drop in the number of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and the wide availability of vaccines fuelled hopes things would be different this summer. For so many it can’t happen soon enough. Fully vaccinated Canadians living in the U.S. haven’t seen their families for over a year because they don’t have enough vacation time to build in a two-week quarantine in Canada. Higgins’ New York constituents who own cottages in Fort Erie, Ont. Border resort destinations like Old Orchard Beach, Maine where 60 per cent of a typical year’s tourist business comes from Canadians, or “Sunset Country” in northwestern Ontario where 95 per cent of fishing lodge rentals are to Americans.  &gt; The border isn’t entirely shut down, even for travel not considered essential. Under the current rules, Canadians can visit the U.S. as long as they quarantine when they return, and it is possible under some circumstances for visiting Canadian citizens to quarantine in the same house as those they plan to visit. It remains much harder for Americans to visit Canada for any non-essential reason, even if they own property there.  &gt; In any event, the numbers show the current restrictions have had a dramatic effect on the number of people crossing the border: A Statistics Canada report released Tuesday morning on international travel to Canada last month showed arrivals to Canada from the U.S. by both land and air were up significantly from April 2020, but were still down more than 90 per cent by land and 96.5 per cent by air when compared to April 2019.  &gt; And there have been some signs that a change may be on the horizon, though there is little momentum at the moment.  &gt; On his second day in office in January, President Joe Biden issued an executive order demanding his cabinet report on the issue of COVID-19 public health measures at the border within two weeks. Almost four months later, there’s been no public indication that report was written.  &gt; Last week, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote to Biden’s cabinet urging them to work with Canada to “finally develop a transparent, bilateral, and public plan” to safely reopen the border to non-essential travel — urgently, he wrote, before another “summer season” is lost. He’s among the most powerful members of the legislative branch of government, and is a Democrat, like Biden and Higgins.  &gt; Meanwhile, earlier this month Canada’s Health Minister Patty Hajdu said some form of vaccine passport would be a requirement for entry upon reopening Canada to visitors, a sign changes to travel policy are at least under consideration.  &gt; Tuesday, Omar Alghabra, Canada’s transport minister, said he’d discussed principles “for reopening the travel sector” with his G7 counterparts recently as part of a “comprehensive, ongoing effort,” but without a resolution in sight. “I can’t give you a time when we’re going to start seeing the gradual reopening, because it’s going to continue to be guided by public health measures and public health advice and public health experts.”  &gt; On the other hand, Premier Doug Ford has publicly suggested in recent weeks that restrictions at the U.S. border should be made stricter, not relaxed. And the U.S. Centers for Disease Control is still listing Canada as a destination Americans should avoid all travel to as a “Level 4” very high-risk country for COVID.  &gt; Officials close to the discussions on the border have been unwilling to speak on the record. Experts reading the tea leaves recently have been projecting no likely change until late summer or fall. The conversations I have had with those familiar with the process in both countries indicate nothing is likely to happen in the next few months.  &gt; To some, that sounds prudent. Others will find it a hard to swallow. Higgins, the U.S. representative, says he’ll keep arguing to at least develop a framework and criteria for decision-making on the question.  &gt; “Just a glimmer of recognition, a glimmer of hope. To say, here are the metrics that we want to reach, and if we reach them, we can get closer to a border opening,” Higgins says. “Nobody is arguing for opening the border arbitrarily or comprehensively. Just, you know, some semblance of vision, albeit limited vision, for return to normalcy.”",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/nbrn83/thinking_of_summer_travel_to_the_us_better_have_a/gy13w76/

1185,3,1620764020,"&gt; I've been hearing for a long time that the inoculated can still spread COVID  It isn't that the innoculated can still spread covid, it's that we didn't have data that they didn't still spread it.   The vaccine creators, in order to get the vaccines out the door quickly, tested whether the vaccine was safe and whether it prevented infection and severe outcomes. They did not test whether it prevented asymptomatic vaccinated individuals from spreading it.  So it isn't so much that the vaccines don't prevent people from spreading it as there was no data to suggest they don't (or data that they do). Good scientists are very careful about precisely stating what the data and studies tell us, and very careful about what they do not.  Right wing media and anti-vaxxers seized upon the ""we have no data on this"" and interpreted it to mean ""vaccines do not prevent spread.""  Which is not correct.  The emerging data (results of vaccination are still being studied) in places like the UK and Israel seem to suggest that the vaccines do prevent the spread of COVID.  &gt; it would also mean the immediate end of lockdown for those who receive it  Except that it takes 2 doses (for most vaccines) spaced at least 3 weeks apart and then an additional 2 weeks after the second dose to maximize the immunity provided by the vaccine. So immediate is relative.  I am not disagreeing with this point, but it opens up a whole other can of worms regarding proof of vaccination. Many countries are moving to various ""vaccine passport"" systems that would be required before boarding airplanes or transportation, or even possibly before entering sporting events, concerts, and other events.  The question then becomes who enforces the vaccine passports. Do we expect restaurant workers to request and enforce that all patrons have been vaccinated? retail workers? or do we wait until vaccination rates are close to a point that provides society with ""herd immunity"" before opening things up?",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/n9woue/vaccines_will_get_us_back_to_normal_why_is_canada/gxrrxon/

There is no evidence, either from other countries or from history, that demanding proof of vaccination to leave your house is at all warranted or needed, but there's plenty of evidence that such draconian demands will increase radicalization among those already opposed to restrictions and vaccinations.  As for those who can't get a vaccine, the only group you listed that actually cannot get vaccinated is children, and that's not a ""forever,"" that's a ""yet."" That, and young children have been shown to be, by and large, almost unaffected by covid, and as everyone who keeps telling me we should open schools says, they're also been shown to be a very low risk for spreading it. Organ recipients and cancer patients can be vaccinated, and both are actually in priority vaccination groups.

If the vaccinated are still expected to be able to be carriers of the virus and able to spread it, as Dr. Tam keeps telling us they are (the reality may be quite different, as far as I'm aware there are pending studies from the US and Israel showing that the vaccinated have such a reduced risk of spreading covid that it basically won't happen, but *our* top medical professional is sharing nothing but doom and gloom), then even the vaccinated would pose a risk to people who are somehow medically unable to get a vaccine.",canada,t5_2qh68,/r/canada/comments/n8gsk9/some_universities_say_no_to_proof_of_vaccination/gxiy027/

1199,0,1618754667,"&gt; There is no well defined end date. It was supposed to end in weeks but was summarily extended to late April. No doubt it will continue to be extended without just cause given.  The end date of quarantine for [travellers is 14 days](https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/isolation). I wasn't talking about the duration of the policy, I was talking about the duration of your quarantine before entering the country. This policy should have been in place from the beginning of the pandemic and should last until the end. If it had, we wouldn't have the new more contagious and lethal variants in Canada right now.  &gt; The Canadian Constutional Federation and Canadian Civil Liberties Association both disagree with you on whether this is constitutional. These organizations are full of constitutional lawyers and policy advocates. What are your credentials?  I'm not interested in ridiculous appeals to authority. Those organizations are activists for civil liberties, and that's good. But [their position](https://theccf.ca/why-quarantine-hotel-requirements-are-now-heading-to-the-courts/) is simply incorrect on some aspects. They are correct to point out that there is no reason to have different standards for exemptions for entering Canada from those leaving and returning, but that's about it.  Quarantining at borders is not ""arbitrary detention"", it's a targeted detention with a specific goal and a specific duration to serve public health, and as long as it's non-discriminatory and evidence-based, then it is constitutional because the government has the authority to define border control policies.  &gt; There is no set time where you can return home. You must show a negative COVID test which have been proven to produce false positives at a very high rate. This system is as much open to abuse as police stopping whoever they want.  First, you're considerably exaggerating the false positivity rate. Whatever the false positive rate, you run the test multiple times to reduce the likelihood of false positives to near zero. This would take a few days at worst.  You're correct to be concerned about abuse, as we should be with any application of power, but possibility of abuse is only relevant if the policy does not or inherently cannot fulfill some meaningful goal. That's not the case here.  Finally, it's not at all like the police stopping whoever they want, it's equivalent to the police stopping *everyone* when engaged in a *specific activity*. In the former case, who police stop can be discriminatory, in the latter it's universal and so simply cannot be discriminatory.  &gt; If we legitimately wanted to stop any mutations from entering we would actually close the border where we have huge numbers of people crossing over.  This is simply impossible. We don't manufacture everything we depend on, which IMO is a mistake as well, but it's one we have to live with, and so some border travel simply must be permitted.  Regardless, there's simply no reason to stop border crossings anyway, as long as border crossers are forced to quarantine.  &gt; Or we would have measures targeting countries where the variants are spreading.  That's not possible. Variants often spread long before they are detected.  &gt; Instead this measure is a blanket policy interning all Canadians entering the country.  It should be a policy applying to all people entering the country, regardless of citizenship. The virus doesn't care what passport you carry.  &gt; The 3rd wave was bound to happen due to the lack of vaccines.  That's conjecture at best. The original strain was less contagious (by ~50%) and less lethal. In epidemiological models of the exponential growth of infections through a population, it means that either:   1. The 3rd wave either wouldn't have happened at all because the original strain wasn't contagious enough or lethal enough to overwhelm hospitals,  2. or it would have happened later when more people were vaccinated, and so also would have been a smaller, more manageable blip rather than the current tsunami.  &gt; Very doubtful that returning Canadians were a significant cause as they haven't been since the virus initially entered the country.  Preventing new more dangerous mutations from entering the country before we're aware of them is the whole point. Someone entering the country brought those new strains.
