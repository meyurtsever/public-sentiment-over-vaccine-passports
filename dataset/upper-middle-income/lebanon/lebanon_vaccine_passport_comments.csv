0,0,1633540224,Maybe if you registered with your ID for the sputnik vaccine you can register with your passport this time for Pfizer/AZ and vice versa. Because if you tried registering with the same ID or passport of the Sputnik they will not allow you to take a new vaccine.,lebanon,t5_2qzpg,/r/lebanon/comments/q2hrct/already_got_sputnik_back_in_june_is_there_a_way/hfmj54o/

All I know is that if you try travel to Europe with Sputnik, your vaccine won’t be accepted",lebanon,t5_2qzpg,/r/lebanon/comments/pka0c1/walkin_vaccination_for_all_people_above_18_years/hc2juk3/

I've lived a bit in Turkey but not more than 1-2 months stretches at a time. What are your questions?",lebanon,t5_2qzpg,/r/lebanon/comments/p5dq9e/any_lebanese_in_turkey/h97h3t6/

I applied and today I took my first shot, tho I only applied to a uni abroad and I still have no idea if I will travel or not.  You need to submit documents like the contract that the university abroad have sent to you and your passport and a proof that your university requires you to be fully vaccinated before you can enter it, just submit random papers and you will get to set an appointment within a day.",lebanon,t5_2qzpg,/r/lebanon/comments/ow3w0z/how_do_i_vaccinate_pfizer/h7g5dc9/

6,0,1617639457,"The vaccine passport is not new. Polio was widespread until vaccination campaigns ended it. Hepatitis vaccines also lowered the rates immensely, same for mumps and rubella and so on and guess what? They were all mandatory w ma ken fik tetsajal bel madrase balehon.  The only reason you are not seeing the horrors of these diseases is because their vaccine was mandatory.  &gt;To comply to live in safety at the expense of personal freedom of choice is a price many are willing to pay until you no longer have freedom whatsoever  Bro aside from the vaccine which will lessen the amount of carriers so as not to kill people, what freedoms are impeded? ""They"" can literally fund a mercenary army to genocide an entire continent and no one would give a shit. And if a shit was given, then given how strong ""they"" re made out to be, they can silence the shit.

7,0,1611995259,Thanks for the quick response. I want to register using my passport but I don't have one yet.   &gt; Children aren't given the vaccine. I know Pfizer only recently started giving it to 12-15 year old but for now most of the vaccines are for adults.
