This is what someone in Australia would get to prove to Immigration/Border Force that they are medically exempt (source).  Actually, you use the ICVC issued by your country of vaccination or residence, not the one issued by where you’re going. New Zealand for example cannot issue me an ICVC even though they have my Australian vaccinations loaded into the CIR so that I can generate a vaccine certificate to get into venues there.    The issue in this case is actually with his Australia Travel Declaration, which specifically requires either vaccination or contraindication, and even ATAGI don’t consider previous infection as a contraindication.

If it's been a full year, a partner visa will probably work for you.  I'm coming to Australia on a prospective marriage visa (subclass 300). This could also be an option for you if you get engaged and don't qualify for a partner visa.  We hired a migration agent and she's been extremely helpful. Expensive, but considering the staggering amount of lawyer time it buys, it's a downright bargain. We could probably have muddled through without her if we'd had to, but if you can afford it, go for it.  For proof of our relationship, we provided a few photos together with various friends and family; a whole bunch of stat decs from his relatives/friends/coworkers; tickets for visits to each other and travel together; receipts for gifts to each other; many screenshots of messages to each other; contracts and email exchanges with wedding vendors; and copies of wedding invitations. We dumped the lot on our agent and let her pick out what was most relevant, so I don't know exactly what ended up getting submitted.  The biggest hassles were in interfacing between different countries' bureaucracies. For example, it was complicated to get a police check from a country I've lived in but that has no police records on me.  I've also had an interesting deadlock: to live with my fiance, I need to move to Australia; for that, I need a visa; for that, I need proof that I'm legally able to marry him; for that, I need a certificate from the French embassy; for that, I need proof that we live together. Oops. I gave my agent copies of documents I sent to apply and of the French embassy's response, and apparently the Australian side of things was happy with that. We'll need to apply for that certificate in a *huge rush* after I arrive, and I don't know what you do if you don't want to live together before marriage for religious reasons or whatever.  One thing that breaks my heart was that I was eligible to participate in a HIV vaccine trial, but it would have made me show up as HIV+ on the standard test, and apparently even with documentation from the trial, that's a no-no for immigration, they won't use a different test.  So, overall, no individually huge bureaucratic hassles, just a lot of work. No embassy visits; the longest trip was the medical check, everything else just required me to go to town hall down the street or to the post office.

It might be less emotionally satisfying and less politically popular with the majority than continually chasing after the small number of remaining hardcore antivaxxers, but all governments in Australia would be well advised to focus pretty much all their attention and effort on getting booster campaigns running as efficiently as possible, and ensuring everyone already vaccinated understands the need to get a third dose and is reminded to do it.  Given the times and dates of every shot are on your vaccination certificate and the entire countries dates are spread out, surely it wouldn't be impossible  to ensure everyone gets a reminder text with information about the closest available vaccine locations when they are eligible for a booster, along with a follow up call 3-4 weeks later from someone who can help arrange an appointment or answer any questions they have.  It does suck a bit that two jabs aren't providing entirely permanent protection, and honestly it wouldn't shock me if some of the public relations efforts from pfizer and co have gone in to glossing over the significance of waning immunity whilst they  initially focused on supporting widespread mass vaccination campaigns- if you're selling someone a car, you tend to focus on how well it drives initially rather than the need for a service 5 months later..

But the sheer number of times I am expected to scan in can often be borderline absurd (and I suspect most people agree to some extent).   I infer this suspicion based on how reluctant most people in general seem to be to actually check your certificate (they do it). But you can tell most do not want to be placed in that position.   For example, I went into Grill'd the other day, and a young woman greeted me as soon as I entered. I said hi.

And then she ran off behind the counter to serve me (I could have been lying). But my word was apparently enough for her.   My point isn't to criticize the girl or whine (she seemed like a wonderful person). But this system is clearly imperfect and I think we all can recognize that. Because this has been my experience typically when being asked to sign in -- reluctance by the people themselves. Because it's an awkward situation to be placed in.

For comparison, normally it is an Indian or Pakistani Uber driver. Sometimes Croatian or some other European place. But they've never once asked me to 'check in'. And the experiences have always been extremely pleasant.   But the Karen (like every Karen I've had) was snide and accusatory. ""Don't you check in at places you go to?... It's no different here"".  Reflexively, I apologized and instantly checked in. But I was frustrated by the glee she was partaking.   She had this wry smile on her face.   ""Much better... Now where are we going today?"".   I told her where I wanted to go but this entire introduction of hers just soured the whole experience for me. I felt like a criminal.

27,0,1637831259,"The greatest irony of all is that the Nazis very famously relaxed smallpox vaccine mandates that had been put in place since 1874.     On one hand, they were running a genocidal campaign so they weren't interested in spending resources to save lives that they would then have to spend resources on taking.   The relaxation of vaccine mandates for minorities was a form of population control.  Here's Hitler translated:    &gt;""In the field of public health there is no need whatsoever to extend to the subject races the benefits of our own knowledge. This would result only in an enormous increase in local populations, and I absolutely forbid the organization of any sort of hygiene or cleanliness crusades in these territories. Compulsory vaccination will be confined to Germans alone, and the doctors in the German colonies will be there solely for the purpose of looking after the German colonists. It is stupid to thrust happiness upon people against their wishes. Dentistry, too, should remain a closed book to them.""  And his Chief of Staff, Martin Bormann:  &gt;""The Slavs are to work for us. Insofar as we don’t need them, they may die. Therefore compulsory vaccination and German health services are superfluous. The fertility of the Slavs is undesirable.""    On the other hand, Hitler was also a populist and his base were a bunch of conspiracy nuts. So they weren't actually that tough on their own people getting vaccinated either.  Conspiracy theories about Jewish secret societies using vaccines to taint pure Aryan blood were very popular.    ""Lebensreform"" was also growing in popularity in Nazi cricles and that was a pretty much a proto-hippy fad that heavily taught replacing chemicals injected into your body with simple lifestyle changes (more sun, more exercise, etc).  So while the Nazis would talk about restricting mandatory vaccines to German citizens they would also play to their base by relaxing vaccine mandates and introducing a system of ""elasticity"" for German citizens. For the German population, the vaccine mandates would still be in place but they wouldn't be enforced.

The Governor-General issued a Proclamation under section 12 of the Quarantine Act 1908, declaring the entire area within a 15 mile radius of the Sydney General Post Office a quarantined area. &gt;  &gt; The Governor-General also made Provisional Regulations under the Quarantine Act 1908–1912. The Regulations provided: &gt;  &gt;&gt; 2 No person who has not been successfully vaccinated shall leave the proclaimed quarantine area of the metropolitan district of Sydney, in the State of New South Wales, for the purpose of journeying to any other State. &gt; &gt;Individuals traveling to other states of the Commonwealth were required to produce a ‘certificate of successful vaccination issued by the Department of Public Health of a State’ on demand of a quarantine officer. The Regulations required the ‘successful vaccination’ must have been within the past five years.  &gt;...  &gt;The penalty for breaching these regulations was up to £50, in a time when the minimum wage was £2.10.0 per week so the maximum penalty was 20 weeks of the minimum wage.

Your body produces immune responses differently based on timing of exposure - similar to the forgetting curve if you know what that is (You remember things far better if you re-learn something just as you are about to forget it). Its the reason why they keep changing the timing of the second dose (several weeks to months) - as new data arises on when immunity weans, re-introducing antigens at this time produces a stronger, longer lasting immune response according to current research. The booster shot is also specifically timed but I dont know the literature around this yet. Getting Covid immediately after the first vaccine is probably similar to having one or the other - your body probably sees it as the same concurrent infection.

Think about the fact people who don't vote get fined - the AEC already knows who is and isn't voting. Australia also doesn't have an undocumented underclass to use as a boogeyman. Who do people think are trying to vote fraudulently? It isn't an issue in America and it isn't an issue here.   [According to the AEC](https://www.aec.gov.au/enrolling_to_vote/enrolment_stats/) there are 17.685,585 eligible voters in Australia. Of these, 16,905,290 are enrolled. [In the 2016 election](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/more-than-18000-people-asked-to-explain-why-they-voted-twice-at-election-20161019-gs5cal.html) , there were 18,000 votes caught as being fraudulent. That is 0.1% of the possible votes. There were also 87 instances of electoral campaign fraud including dodgy how to vote cards handed out by political groups.  As far as ID is concerned, when I lived in Australia I had ID but it rarely matched my home address. I didn't drive and having a correct address wasn't important for buying alcohol. In fact, I lived in Canberra for three years without ever switching my drivers license from my NSW learners. I could change my voting enrolment details online and without a fee. Because I moved so often (landlords constantly increasing rents) there would be quite a cost involved in making my ID match my address. One time I didn't quite make my enrolment changes in time and they accommodated me by making me do an out of area form.  Personally I'm against a vaccine passport for everyday life because it seems like a hassle. I'm in NZ now and had to apply for my NZ passport because otherwise I might not be able to prove I'm vaccinated. A difficult to forge vaccine certificate or having it linked to my medicare/nhs number would be fine imo.",australia,t5_2qh8e,/r/australia/comments/qr2xaa/its_unclear_why_new_laws_to_enforce_voter/hk4v64m/

35,1,1636174433,"&gt; But riddle me this. If somebody were to make the same argument for a vaccination certificate, how would you feel?  This is not even half as clever as you think it is. The point of vaccination certificates is mostly (a) to keep the unvaccinated away from potentially contracting/spreading a dangerous virus in crowded public places, and a little (b) to make life mildly inconvenient for the unvaccinated as an incentive to get the jab. Putting up barriers to entry in a pub accomplishes both those goals, and it doesn't in any way impinge upon their democratic freedoms (unless you believe sinking piss in public is essential to democracy). If you forgot your phone going to the pub then tough fucking titties, come back another time. You'll live.  The inconvenience is both *targeted appropriately* (i.e. at non-essential luxuries) and *proportionate to the utility* (i.e. vaccination against COVID-19 is useful enough to justify inconveniencing people, and distancing the unvaccinated is useful enough to the rest of society).  You cannot say any of that for voter ID. It impinges upon access to the core of democracy (the right to vote), its utility is negligible (voter fraud is a non-issue), and it is targeted indiscriminately.

36,0,1635661849,"OK, there are about 14 steps you need to jump through to get them into Australia.  Each one of those steps has timing attached to it.   So for example; you need a blood test for rabies antibodies so many weeks before they land in Australia.  And to get that they have to have the rabies vaccine so many weeks before that.  And it doesn't always take.  So you've got to aim for the earliest window.  And that's just 2 steps.  And that's just the Australian side of the bureaucracy.  You have to get certain certs from the exiting country and they have steps you need to go through to get that.  So you have to overlay the two bureaucracies and figure out the timing of each.  Then you've got a third country involved.  This is why the agents can charge so much.

79,0,1628170265,"Vaccine Covid Mary's. Because of the nature of the vaccine, it raises the possibility of asymptomatic infections that can still pass on covid to others. When that is a known FACT, it means every single person must be vaxxed at the same time OR all vaxxed people need to wait with no ""special exemptions to be out and about"" or ""vaccine passports"" till the very last person is vaxxed. Or until the very last ""person at risk of death"" is vaxxed. As we saw yesterday even a no preexisting condition 27 year old can die, so it is really hard to pick who is a ""person at risk of death"".   Supply is the problem now that it has been opened up to all over 16. You cannot be out and about being a Vaxxed COVID Mary until at least all in the population have been given the opportunity, VIA ADEQUATE SUPPLY, to get a vaccine.   Me i have already had covid twice the second time was so mild i will take my chances unvaxxed, will confirm this with antibody testing tommorow and be asking my doctor for an exemption certificate should an employer OVERSTEP their bounds and MANDATE VACCINE, or no job.

82,0,1625498069,"&gt;Why can't we just get a vaccine fucking passport stamp already?  What and do something?   If you bored read this:  Today the European Commission is proposing to create a Digital Green Certificate to facilitate safe free movement inside the EU during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Digital Green Certificate will be a proof that a person has been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result or recovered from COVID-19. It will be available, free of charge, in digital or paper format. It will include a QR code to ensure security and authenticity of the certificate. The Commission will build a gateway to ensure all certificates can be verified across the EU, and support Member States in the technical implementation of certificates. Member States remain responsible to decide which public health restrictions can be waived for travellers but will have to apply such waivers in the same way to travellers holding a Digital Green Certificate.        Vice-President for Values and Transparency, Věra Jourová said: “The Digital Green Certificate offers an EU-wide solution to ensure that EU citizens benefit from a harmonised digital tool to support free movement in the EU. This is a good message in support of recovery. Our key objectives are to offer an easy to use, non-discriminatory and secure tool that fully respects data protection. And we continue working towards international convergence with other partners.”        Commissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, said: “With the Digital Green Certificate, we are taking a European approach to ensure EU citizens and their family members can travel safely and with minimum restrictions this summer. The Digital Green Certificate will not be a pre-condition to free movement and it will not discriminate in any way. A common EU-approach will not only help us to gradually restore free movement within the EU and avoid fragmentation. It is also a chance to influence global standards and lead by example based on our European values like data protection.”        Key elements of the regulation proposed by the Commission today:        Accessible and secure certificates for all EU citizens:    The Digital Green Certificate will cover three types of certificates –vaccination certificates, test certificates (NAAT/RT-PCR test or a rapid antigen test), and certificates for persons who have recovered from COVID-19.    The certificates will be issued in a digital form or on paper. Both will have a QR code that contains necessary key information as well as a digital signature to make sure the certificate is authentic.    The Commission will build a gateway and support Member States to develop software that authorities can use to verify all certificate signatures across the EU. No personal data of the certificate holders passes through the gateway, or is retained by the verifying Member State.    The certificates will be available free of charge and in the official language or languages of the issuing Member State and English.    Non-discrimination:    All people – vaccinated and non-vaccinated – should benefit from a Digital Green Certificate when travelling in the EU. To prevent discrimination against individuals who are not vaccinated, the Commission proposes to create not only an interoperable vaccination certificate, but also COVID-19 test certificates and certificates for persons who have recovered from COVID-19.    Same right for travellers with the Digital Green Certificate –where Member States accept proof of vaccination to waive certain public health restrictions such as testing or quarantine, they would be required to accept, under the same conditions, vaccination certificates issued under the Digital Green Certificate system. This obligation would be limited to vaccines that have received EU-wide marketing authorisation, but Member States can decide to accept other vaccines in addition.    Notification of other measures – if a Member State continues to require holders of a Digital Green Certificate to quarantine or test, it must notify the Commission and all other Member States and explain the reasons for such measures.    Only essential information and secure personal data:    The certificates will include a limited set of information such as name, date of birth, date of issuance, relevant information about vaccine/test/recovery and a unique identifier of the certificate. This data can be checked only to confirm and verify the authenticity and validity of certificates.    The Digital Green Certificate will be valid in all EU Member States and open for Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway as well as Switzerland. The Digital Green Certificate should be issued to EU citizens and their family members, regardless of their nationality. It should also be issued to non-EU nationals who reside in the EU and to visitors who have the right to travel to other Member States.        The Digital Green Certificate system is a temporary measure. It will be suspended once the World Health Organization (WHO) declares the end of the COVID-19 international health emergency.        Next Steps        To be ready before the summer, this proposal needs a swift adoption by the European Parliament and the Council.        In parallel, Member States must implement the trust framework and technical standards, agreed in the eHealth network, to ensure timely implementation of the Digital Green Certificate, their interoperability and full compliance with personal data protection. The aim is to have the technical work and the proposal completed in the coming months.        Background        To comply with the measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus, travellers in the EU have been asked to provide various documents, such as medical certificates, test results, or declarations. The absence of standardised formats has resulted in travellers experiencing problems when moving within the EU. There have also been reports of fraudulent or forged documents.        In their statement adopted following the informal video conferences on 25 and 26 February 2021, the members of the European Council called for work to continue on a common approach to vaccination certificates. The Commission has been working with the Member States in the eHealth Network, a voluntary network connecting national authorities responsible for eHealth, on preparing the interoperability of vaccination certificates. Guidelines were adopted on 27 January and updated on 12 March, and the trust framework outline was agreed on 12 March 2021.        Today the Commission adopted a legislative proposal establishing a common framework for a Digital Green Certificate. The Commission also adopted a complementary proposal to ensure that the Digital Green Certificate is also issued to non-EU nationals who reside in Member States or Schengen Associated States and to visitors who have the right to travel to other Member States. Separate proposals to cover citizens and non-EU citizens are necessary for legal reasons; there is no difference in treatment of citizens and eligible non-EU citizens for the purpose of the certificates.        The latest information on coronavirus measures as well as travel restrictions provided to us by Member States are available on the Re-open EU platform.",australia,t5_2qh8e,/r/australia/comments/ociw5u/a_mild_level_of_suffocation_australians_overseas/h44vxxb/
