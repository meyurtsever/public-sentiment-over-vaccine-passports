My situation:   I am South African and we only have around 200 covid cases a day atm but still we are considered a medium risk zone even though some European countries are at 25 000+ a day and low risk... don't understand that logic. Anyway so we needed to apply for the sandbox setup.  You can imagine how stressed we were about our vaccine certificate QR code not being recognised because South Africa is usually behind on everything or not even thought about before the richer countries so there was very little faith it would go through smoothly.  We uploaded through: - Gmail,  - Used ordinary passport - South African vaccine certificate + separate pic of vaccine QR code. Our vaccine certificate showed our ID numbers but not passport numbers (so I wouldn't worry about editing that in like some people have)  - For accomadation we just used our SHABA certificate which we requested from sha+ hotel and entered the SHABA number provided  into the booking ID part. - AXA insurance certificate showed specifically that covid is covered.   I was honestly the most stressed and strung out I have ever been, I registered a few times on different emails, because I was so scared I had done something wrong. I called my countries Thai embassy who could not help, I tried calling that helpline they provided but noone answered, couldnt sleep or eat.. But my girlfriend remained calm and only made one application without reapplying 50 times like me and at the end of the day we both got the approvals and she got hers 1 hour before me!!  That being said, the best advice I can offer is; STAY CALM. I have not seen many cases of anyone being out right denied yet, we are all rightfully stressing because we are in the first few weeks of the system operating and are essentially guinea pigs! I know it sucks but it had to start somewhere and I truly believe that as long as you made your application with at least 3 full working days to go I am pretty certain they will approve you!   One thing that I noticed did go through is the email to support@tp.consular.go.th they only answered me straight after I had been approved and said that I am already approved - lol-  but it was confirmation that the email line does indeed work!
