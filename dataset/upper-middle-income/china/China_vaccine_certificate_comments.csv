4,0,1627525011,"There are a few problems.  First, Olympics tickets are still not available even though there's only five month left. Judging by the current covid situation tickets might be limited. Some event may even hold without audience. So get a ticket before you get a flight.  Second, there's a mandatory quarantine for those who enter China. I think it's 28 days if you want to go to the city center of Beijing for figure skating. So beware of the time.  Then to your question. China has been limiting the flight to US since the early stage of the pandemic. I believe every airline have a limited number of 1-2 flight per week and there's a meltdown/bonus mechnaism. If there are 5 cases in a single flight the flight will pause for 2 weeks. To my knoweldge the non-stop flight is CA987/988 (LA -  Tianjin and straight to Beijing after quarantine). If you want to land somewhere else there's also CA769/770, MU587/588, CZ327/328, MF829/830, UA857/858, DL289/288, DL283/284, AA127/128. These flights require Chinese citizens to provide covid test and vaccine certificate so it will be tougher for foreign citizens to book. Be sure to ask the airline for info.  But these non-stop flights are hard to book and very expensive. I would just fly a longer trip.",China,t5_2qh2v,/r/China/comments/oth1z8/why_arent_they_any_nonstop_flights_to_china_from/h6wpnaf/
