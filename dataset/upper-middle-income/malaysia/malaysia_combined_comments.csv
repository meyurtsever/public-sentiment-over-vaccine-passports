Never caught Covid, this despite multiple times being in contact with persons who have tested positive within a few days of contact.  Survivorship bias. But you do you.  &gt; Informed consent. I believe the job of the government is to present its citizens with as much facts as it can and yet leave consent to the individual. I am of the opinion that vaccine mandates are fundamentally wrong. If you don't have sovereignty over your own body, then what do you have left? You might as well not live.  &gt; If someone decides they are not ready to take any vaccine for any reason. That should be their sovereign right. If you are happy to take a vaccine, again, that is your personal right. No one should force anyone else to do anything.

However, this notion of sovereignty would be inapplicable in times of emergency, such as the pandemic we're in.  &gt; Mask mandate &amp; vaccine passport. I don't really know how I feel about this. On one hand I do see the appeal of the wider benefit of keeping the community safe, on the other hand I do not agree that the government should have the right of telling you where you can and cannot go based on whether you have taken a jab. Perhaps leave this to the decision of the individual business owners / shop themselves?  Refer to the above counterpoint. In times of emergency, a unified measure will mitigate the aftermath better.  &gt; No difference in 'user experience' of vaccinated vs unvaccinated. Vaccinated: Can catch covid, can spread covid, can be hospitalised, can die. Unvaccinated: Can catch covid, can spread covid, can be hospitalised, can die.  The science behind COVID is still at its infancy; science ain't a magic bullet. To use an analogy, wearing seat belts can reduce car crash fatalities by thousand folds but idiots will still argue personal freedom and complaining discomfort and inconveniences.  &gt; Never have I ever seen a movement on this scale to coerce people into taking a vaccine, and to dehumanise those who don't comply.   Read up on centuries of human history battling plagues.  &gt; Do not vaccinate the children. I am happy KKM's stance is that vaccination of kids is optional. The death rate of SARS CoV-2 is &lt;0.0115% in children below 12 (per KKM data). This is THE SAME as the death rate of the common cold in children below 12 (per CDC data). So why vaccinate kids?  Because the science behind COVID is not fully understood, and that kids' immune system is still developing.  &gt; Goalposts keep changing. They took your fundamental human right freedoms under the guise of keeping you safe. Then they said you'll get your freedoms back when you get vaccinated. Then they said not good enough, get boosted. No one knows how the goalpost will change next.  Refer to the above counterpoints. The goalpost will always be subject to change. That's not necessarily a bad thing.  As for the remarks on how other countries are handling COVID, do note that their strategies and countermeasures have yet to yield results. For example, Japanese government's natural immunity plan is heavily criticised by their own citizens, especially during the Olympics last year.

1,1,1,1643273923,"Here are the low-down, from my recent experience.  1. Within 2 days before your board the plane, get the Covid test. Make sure you don't have a weekend between the test and you leaving — then the 2 days over Sunday (where labs are closed) is a non-started.  In such case, you'd have to pay much dollars for a same-day result. 2. (actually, the stupid cert that the foreign clinic produced can be forged easily, so it is a stupid thing to require that) 3. The website you apply for is basically for home Quarantine, otherwise, you'd be assigned a center to do your quarantine — hotel, or MOH's god-forsaken dorm centers. 4. So, to apply for home quarantine, you will have to prep before hand:    1. Get low-res photos of the house (outside &amp; in) you plan to quarantine in    2. Get low-res images of your Covid vaccination certs, passports, IC    3. From the US, go to this website, [https://hso.moh.gov.my](https://hso.moh.gov.my)    4. You can only apply for this home quarantine no more than X days before your flight. 5. Once it is approved, you will be given an email.  Save that email, as you will need to show that to the MOH person at KLIA (I don't know about other airports). This email can came to you on the day you fly, or when you are in transit.  How's that for tension? 6. Why low-res images?  The fackers who developed the web-site placed a size restriction on the uploads per file (250Kb).  You better be a tech person who can deal with shrinking file sizes, etc.  Those damn facking facks . 7. Once you land in the KLIA, you will be taken on a bus to the quarantine area.  On the bus, you will see QR codes.  Get started on entering the data they need, while the rest of the passengers just stand there like dummies.  If you have many flights coming at the same time, this time saved can get you through the queues quicker. 8. Get your ticket, and passport ready, as you will need to furnish some data through the website.  Enter those data in darkness while you sway inside the bus. 9. When you finally get to the counters, they will check your data you entered already, your MOH home quarantine order, COVID results, MySejahtera (if you have it) or vaccination certificates, blah blah blah. 10. If all in order, you go through another Covid test, and they give you a lanyard. 11. You clear Immigration, then get to the MOH counters where they take your lanyard and then put some sort of wrist band tracker thinjamajig. 12. I think then, you clear immigration and customs after that.  ps. I don't know if these processes are changed from country-to-country.  I was coming back from the US.  And I don't know if the recent change in policy by KJ is in effect already.",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/sdtpig/returning_from_overseas_registration_website_with/huf1jr4/

When was the last time KKM told you to eat well, get enough sunlight, exercise and boost your natural immune system?   \- The virus is real but the response of governments all over the world from the start of the pandemic has been unprecedented and a vast overreach of powers. It is clear, even as recent as today from Denmark, that lockdowns kill economies more effectively than it prevents Covid spread. If lockdowns worked, then everyone in the UAE (which has not had a lockdown since June 2020) should have caught Covid and died by now.  \- Goalposts keep changing.

Below is the article (not OP link)     **Hidden camera reveals 'appalling' conditions in overseas PPE factory supplying Canadian hospitals, expert says**Posted: Jan 15, 2021 4:00 AM ET | Last Updated: January 17  As global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) surges during the pandemic, so has the human cost for those making it overseas, an investigation by CBC’s Marketplace has found.  *Hidden camera footage inside the world's largest glove manufacturer in Malaysia shows several employees working in close quarters. Shortly after, there was a massive COVID-19 outbreak that led to nearly 6,000 infections. (Name withheld)*  The wall of noise is constant as the workers manually check, sort and pack a seemingly endless supply of disposable gloves into boxes destined for international markets like Canada.  The production line, filled mostly with migrant workers, is cramped. Yet COVID-19 protocols like sanitizing, physical distancing or mask-wearing, meant to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, don't seem to be enforced at this Malaysian factory.  ""They just want \[you\] to work. They just want product. They don't care about the worker,"" said one employee from Nepal, who works 12 hours every day.  In spite of these health risks, some employees say they can't leave their jobs. They say they have significant debt — often borrowed at the hands of unscrupulous lenders — having paid recruitment agencies massive fees to line them up for their jobs.  ""I don't have any choice, I have to work \[to pay off my debt\],"" said another worker from Bangladesh, who makes around $3 an hour and is paying back loans two years after starting his job.  As global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) surges during the pandemic, so has the human cost for those making it overseas, an investigation by CBC's Marketplace has found.  The investigation into the global PPE trade revealed that some of the life-saving equipment Canadian health-care workers are using appears to be made in sweatshop-like conditions — raising doubts about Canada's commitment to international human rights and its ability to prevent unethically sourced goods from entering the country.  Workers at the Top Glove factory in Malaysia wait in line to be tested for COVID-19 following a plantwide outbreak in November. (Reuters)  ""We can say without doubt that the \[glove\] industry remains a hotbed of systemic forced labour and modern slavery,"" said Andy Hall, an international migrant worker rights specialist based in Southeast Asia. ""\[Migrant workers\] are not seen as human beings…. They're often treated as second-class citizens and systemically abused.""  Several Canadian companies that have tens of millions of dollars in PPE contracts with the federal government imported goods from the Malaysian manufacturers Marketplace investigated.  ""Canada is tainted and Canada is complicit in this abuse that's going on,"" said Hall.  ***How unethically sourced PPE could be ending up in some Canadian hospitals | Marketplace***    Marketplace spoke to nearly two dozen employees at disposable glove factories in Malaysia who say they face unsafe work and living conditions and violence on the job. Many of these goods could be making their way into the Canadian health-care system. 3:13  Canada, through import laws, prohibits the entry of goods that are produced with forced labour, which according to the International Labour Organization (ILO) can include such indicators as debt bondage, restriction of movement, excessive overtime and poor living conditions.  Yet according to records reviewed by Marketplace, millions of disposable gloves manufactured by Malaysian companies in conditions that experts say have the hallmarks of forced labour have come into our ports.  Hidden camera footage also showed unsafe working and poor living conditions inside a Malaysian factory, which Hall described as ""really, really appalling"" after viewing the video.  ***Hidden camera reveals where some of your PPE comes from***  An insider documents conditions inside his factory and workers’ dorms and a labour activist reacts to what he calls “appalling” conditions at a Top Glove factory in Malaysia. 2:05  Marketplace interviewed 23 current and former migrant workers from across the disposable glove industry in Malaysia who detailed various stories of alleged exploitation: situations of debt bondage, deceptive recruiting practices, passport retention, excessive overtime, abusive workplaces and deplorable living conditions.  Gloves of all types — nitrile, vinyl, latex — are used by health-care workers in many situations,  including swabbing, intubating and examinations. Some health-care professionals can go through several boxes of gloves a week.  ""The only reason I haven't gotten sick, it isn't just luck — it's PPE,"" said  Dr. Nadia Alam, a family doctor and anesthesiologist in Georgetown, Ont. ""It makes me mad that nobody's taking care of \[these workers\].... It's despicable, these kind of practices.""  Dr. Nadia Alam, a physician in Georgetown, Ont., credits PPE with keeping her safe throughout the pandemic. (CBC)  In 2020, Malaysian glove makers produced close to 220 billion gloves, about 70 per cent of the world's supply, according to the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association. Manufacturers rely heavily on migrant workers from countries with few employment opportunities, including Myanmar, Indonesia, Nepal and Bangladesh.  Reports of human rights abuses in the PPE industry aren't isolated to gloves. Gowns were reportedly being made with North Korean forced labour. Masks were being made by ethnic Uyghurs as part of a controversial labour transfer program in China.  ""This is an issue around the world,""  said Hall. ""The whole supply chain of medical products, ventilators, masks, gloves, gowns, it's all coming from an industry with systemic forced labour issues.""",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/qwdbh6/canada_halts_import_of_goods_linked_to_forced/hl2wjlv/

13,13,0,1635386740,"**By Liza Lin, Yifan Wang and Jon Emont**  *Oct. 27, 2021 11:22 am ET*  SINGAPORE—Chinese laborer Zhang Qiang set off for Indonesia in March to work for a Chinese steelmaker. Six months later, he was wading through the waters off Malaysia’s shores with four other men, fleeing what he called a scam.  “I felt we were cheated, yet also felt I was helpless,” Mr. Zhang said in an interview from Malaysia, where the men were detained by local authorities.  Mr. Zhang said he was lured to Indonesia by the promise of a better paying job, but his passport was taken once he got off the plane. He and other workers were asked to sign contracts for lower pay and longer durations than they had been promised.  Around 600,000 Chinese migrant workers were employed abroad at the end August, according to official government data, with many of them working for Chinese companies on projects connected to President Xi Jinping’s signature Belt and Road infrastructure-building initiative.  China Labor Watch, a labor rights group based in New York, says experiences like those of Mr. Zhang and his colleagues aren’t uncommon. Based on interviews with around 200 workers in 12 countries and information from a whistleblower in China’s trade ministry who it hasn’t publicly identified, the group estimates that tens of thousands of workers abroad are being paid less than they were promised or exploited in other ways.  China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn’t respond to a request for comment. Beijing has acknowledged the existence of illegal and unlicensed labor dispatch practices over the years. In 2012, the Ministry of Commerce issued a new rule aimed at protecting the rights of overseas workers, and in 2016 asked local authorities to step up enforcement of the rule due to continued violations.  Mr. Zhang, a 31-year-old father of two from China’s central Henan province, was promised the equivalent of about 15,000 yuan ($2,300) a month for a period of six months—an attractive prospect for a man who earned far less welding metal bars at construction sites in China, he said.  He was employed at a work site in the Morowali Industrial Park, a Belt and Road project where Chinese steel giants had invested in large-scale smelting of nickel for use in making stainless steel and electric-vehicle batteries.  Launched in 2013, the trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative aims to tie countries around the world to the Chinese economy through a new network of roads, railways, ports, power plants and factories.  Chinese companies invested at least $12.7 billion into Indonesian steel and nickel projects since 2013, drawn by its large nickel reserves, according to a Wall Street Journal tally of such projects.  The reliance by Chinese companies on labor brought from China instead of local hires has fed resentment in some places. Earlier this year, a large Indonesian labor union criticized the use of unskilled Chinese laborers, saying it cheated local workers out of jobs.Mr. Zhang’s journey began in mid-March, when he saw an advertisement for the Indonesia job in a chat message group for migrant workers. Lured by the promise of a pay bump, he contacted the recruiter who posted the ad and packed a suitcase, reassuring his family that the move would fund a better life, according to his wife, Wang Lan.“When I come back, I’ll buy you a bed,” he told the younger of his two daughters, before boarding a bus in the city of Anyang, in Henan province, to head to the airport, Ms. Wang said.Chinese labor contractors have to obtain a government license before arranging for workers to go overseas.   Commercial and human resources bureaus in the eastern city of Wuxi, where Mr. Zhang’s privately-run contractor Rongcheng Environmental Engineering Co. is based, said no local companies had obtained such a license.Ms. Wang said her husband wasn’t given a contract to sign before leaving and didn’t think to ask the company for proof of a license.   Rongcheng didn’t respond to a request for comment.Arriving in Indonesia, Mr. Zhang and other workers recruited from China were told to put their passports in a box, according to an account posted on WeChat by Mr. Zhang and other workers in early September. They were then transported to a metal smelter site in Morowali operated by Jiangsu Delong Nickel Co. Ltd., a privately-owned Chinese steelmaker whose nickel-production operation in Indonesia was described by Chinese authorities in May 2020 as a “key Belt and Road project.”   Rongcheng Environmental Engineering is a subcontractor for Jiangsu Delong.At Morowali, they were offered construction jobs at a salary of 10,000 yuan a month—instead of the promised 15,000—asked to work longer hours and presented with employment contracts that paid out 1,000 yuan in cash monthly—with the rest of their salary withheld until completion of the project at an unspecified date in the future, according to Ms. Wang.Jiangsu Delong didn’t respond to a request for comment.  Local anger toward Chinese workers means there are few politicians or local organizations in places like Indonesia who are focused on their welfare, which adds to their vulnerability, say labor experts.  China’s pursuit of a zero-Covid-19 strategy has further compounded the problem, according to China Labor Watch’s founder Li Qiang, whose organization has interviewed Chinese workers across Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe since August 2020. Drastic reductions in the number of international flights and stringent entry conditions, including antibody testing and long quarantines, have made it hard for many workers to return home, he said.  Chinese laborers in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Serbia told the Journal that with few new workers coming to replace them, existing workers are prevented or discouraged from returning. Those who want to leave often have to fork over large sums to pay for air tickets and quarantines, which can run between two to four weeks, the laborers said. Workers are generally promised airfare for their travel to and from the countries, but during the pandemic, employers have in many cases withheld the return airfare to get workers to stay longer on the job.  One worker building roads as part of a Belt and Road project in Papua New Guinea, who declined to be named, said about half of the 100 workers on the project are working past the end of their three-year contracts because they are unable to return home.  The price of returning home more than tripled to 65,000 yuan this year after the Chinese government ruled that citizens could only return home on direct flights, he said. With no direct flights from Papua New Guinea, workers needed to fly to Laos and quarantine there first before heading back to China, he said.",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/qhc9v5/chinese_workers_say_they_are_lured_abroad_and/hibvld1/

Maybe they will ask for it once the cancellation is done.  They always ask for the original passport. I’m not sure if any of that process has changed due to covid.

Singapore just announced their ""Vaccinate or Regular Test"" regime today, effective from 1 October.  Source: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=374045344080951&amp;id=100044264657476&amp;sfnsn=mo  For example, if you are unvaccinated by the time the health pass system is in place, you are not allowed to leave your home at all unless you pay for two swab tests(whether positive or negative) each week. You are also forbidden to dine in, gyms and not allowed to attend large events such as concerts, parades.   But if you are vaccinated with both doses, you will be exempted from this requirement and you can enjoy the benefits of the vaccinated, such as dine in with 5 pax and above, no masks(save money) etc.   If they take the second dose now before the Malaysian government announces it, they won't have to rush and flock to get vaccinated at last minute like crowds in [France] (https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/more-than-900000-people-france-rush-covid-vaccine-tougher-measures-near-2021-07-13/) which can cause COVID clusters.

24,24,0,1628130850,"My 2 cents  The timing of the lockdown actually made people forget 2 large clusters that recently formed:  Genting Cluster  Raya Cluster  Genting cluster is large and is a great example of motherfucking stupid fuckers at top level of genting's management as well as the fucking gamblers. it also highlight HOW FUCKED we are with enforcement. how could they open? why are they allowed to open? HOW the fucking fuck?  were they summoned later? i dont have a clue  Raya cluster is also dumb BUT i can understand why people did it. i dont support people who drove back for raya, but at the very least its because of FAMILY. not because of stupid gambling addictions which is fucking inexcusable. that said, the  raya cluster would be a larger contributor to the numbers.   these 2 clusters were bombs that were waiting to trigger. people spread the virus here n there without knowing, thinking ""lockdown mah"" ""i m safe NOW mah"". nope. you wont know till its too fucking late. one of the gamblers from genting or one of the makciks who balik raya maybe went to a  supermarket, went around touching fruit. had close contact with the cashier, then the cashier spread it around to everyone else.  who the fuck knows how many people got it?   also, we are experiencing LOCKDOWN FATIGUE. people are starting to suicide, and those that dont, are pretty much DAMN tired of all the lockdowns. the last 2 month lock down is BULLSHIT.   some industries are left open FINE. i actually can accept that. some industries are actually essential. Beer closed down? FINE. But LV? someone on r/malaysia posted a sign showing LV could operate. LIKE WHAT THE FLYING FUCK? you fucking kidding me?  then theres the enforcement. cannot travel interstate. cannot travel more than 10km.  WHERES THE ENFORCEMENT?   i had been going to hospital interstate previously as someone close was hospitalized. i got caught and fined. OK i accept that i should get a doctors note or watever. i paid the fine and wasnt given leniency (except early payment discount). no time for compassion that someone i know is in hospital. FINE i honestly dont hold that against KKM. it was i who did not follow the proper procedure. i accept that.  but what grinds my gears is that i have driven past that same road block maybe 7-8 times and only ONCE was i actually stopped. another time that i was checked was when i had my documentations so they waved me off when i flashed it.   ROAD BLOCKS FOR WHAT? if you say road blocks cause jam. sure thats a given but, WHATS THE FUCKING  POINT OF ROADBLOCKS, if youre just gonna wave 90% of the people off?  ""he looks like hes not going anywhere"", ""oh he looks like hes going interstate""   whats the criteria? why bother having a road block if you dont check EVERYONE.   i strongly support a PROPER lockdown. many people might hate it, i've always supported the idea that we should have done proper lockdowns back last year.  but no. ""small people need to survive"". ""how to eat"". look at where we are now. i told people, our condition is like an athlete with leg injury. the athlete COULD continue training with LOW performance, lower recovery rate AND potential for harming his leg injury even more. OR take an extended but PROPER break allowing him to heal up first.  nope. a huge lot of people are stuck with how do we eat.   similarly schools. some parents say  ""if schools are closed, i cant work coz i need to take care of my kid"". look at what the fuck happened. schools opened, VERY SHORTLY people caught covid  from school clusters. now NOT ONLY do you  have to take care of your kid, your kid is sick. and YOU ARE TOO. so dont need to work either. good fucking job.  i do see the importance of education. i have no confidence that zoom education can work. but if a parent  is working from home or aren't able to work due to everywhere being closed. perhaps an idea, is why not..... TEACH YOUR CHILDREN YOURSELF? i m digressing.  we still live in a time where people do not fear the virus enough. some people say its fake. some people dont believe in vaccines. some people believe their faith will keep them protected.  it REALLY doesnt help that sometimes our LEADERS do not set a good example with photos of them breaking SOP. also, i DONT UNDERSTAND, why is it, that when you need to give a speech, or if you're being recorded, or if you're taking a simple selfie, YOU NEED to take your mask down? is your face so damn fucking important?   so are the influencers on insta/fb/tiktok. sometimes i wonder, are they breaking SOP being so close with other people? sure some of them may have the excuse ""i live with these people"". if thats the case STILL, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE WORD ""INFLUENCER?"" you are influencing people to disregard the SOP. WHO THE FUCK knows who's staying together? monkey see monkey do. in malaysia we have monkeys everywhere.  lets get back to lockdown fatigue, and suicides. people are tired. the people ""like me"" who follow  the SOP. play it safe etc. we're fucking tired. when people are tired, they tend to let their guard down. when we make ourselves vulnerable, our chances of getting it is higher. but at this point many of us are starting to no longer care. fuckit. kena, kenalah. nasib mah.  then theres the issue of VAXXHOLES. a lot of people are getting vaccinated. i am quite happy to hear that. BUT, some people are getting vaccinated SO THEY CAN GO OUT.   selfish fucks.   there are people who cannot vaccinate or have a risk that make them unable to vaccinate. these people are vulnerable. i dislike those who actively refuse vaccination but i would still sympathize. sometimes a child is born into a family of antivaxxers. are you telling me that you wouldnt mind spreading covid onto these people? really. wheres the sympathy? be a better person!  there are a lot of talks on allowing people to get a ""travel passport"". where having single/double vaccination allows you to go out/dine in etc. let me just bring you back to what i mentioned earlier. implementation and enforcement is SHIT. roadblocks are poorly implemented. what makes you certain that this travel passport can work?  the ""easiest"" solution is everyone is forced to show their vax status using mysejahtera. i admit this is the ONLY reasonable way to implement it. but it must come with REQUIRING people to show their IC/passport. i have witnessed a delivery company get blocked from entering a premise as one of their workers ""didnt bring phone"". they came back later and were allowed entry as the ""phone"" they brought has double vaccines and is in good status.  i strongly believe that people will not be diligent to check and ensure the phone/mysejahtera matches the person ID. checking the mysejahtera is already a hassle in itself.  i m digressing again.  the virus. is like a stupid chain mail. send this to 10 friends or bad luck falls onto you. some people check their mail late. forwards this to their friends. and their friends keep reforwarding it back to themselves over and over again.  a vicious cycle of infection because not everyone is taking it seriously enough.  i m fucking sick and tired of this shit.",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/oxyxid/why_is_malaysia_covid_cases_keep_rising/h7rapo9/

26,26,0,1626102301,"Thanks for your honest response. I hope the discussion can continue without personal attacks.  I'd like to dig a bit deeper to better understand where you are coming from, as I too have encountered a few anti-vax and vaccine hesitant individual.  From what I gather, it's not that you do not take the pandemic seriously, but that you do not trust the authority mandating the vaccine. Is this only at the local scale (incompetent govt), or is it in line with more of the global mistrust (globalist central control agenda)? If not can you help articulate your point of view? I can understand if the mistrust is local, and if the virus is only affecting the region. But seeing that the pandemic is global, and we can see the daily news  countries that have started to open up due to more vaccination, what else would it take to convince you to register? Also do you see any other way free people could tackle the issue of global pandemic without global coordination and support?     Secondly, do you work or have close friends who work with people in the medical field? Do you accept their concern that the longer the virus exists and is allowed to spread, the higher the chance for it to evolve into something more deadly? What are your thoughts on vaccination for people who work at the hospitals where they are exposed to infected people far more than the normal person?     There are many reasons for one to be anti-vax/vaccine hesitant, so is good to be able to have civilized discussion about it. From my own encounter, the most anti-vax person I have personally talked to at length, has a general mistrust of authority both locally and globally. She also came from a religious background that saw current events as fulfilling some biblical prophecy. At one point she also brought up parallels with the 'mark of the beast' to the vaccine, and vaccine passports being a way for the globalist to control human kind. It took a bit of convincing to show that we have always needed some sort of vaccine passport to travel to high risk area. It's just that this is a global pandemic the type we only see once a century, and everywhere is high risk, before the conversation could be brought back closer to reality. It took a few months of discussion before she decided to change her view on the vaccine.  Another vaccine hesitant encounter is not my own but that of a family member who had a friend who also adopted the wait and see approach. She did not register even when her age group has already long been called for appointment. I could not get any further details behind her hesitancy, other than she wanted to ""wait and see"". Unfortunately she contracted Covid in May, admitted to ICU, put on oxygen and had organ failure after 2 months. She passed away recently without her family by her side.  I'm not sharing this to scare you into registering, or forcing my P.O.V on you. Just to share my stories of people I have encountered (not on internet). If other people can share their experience with people they know ( in real life), or their own reasons for choosing not to vaccinate, please share.

I meant during MCO i do witness a lot of people not follow the SOP and do whatever they want, ie group activities w/o mask. Take Taiwan as a case study, they did impose a self lockdown prior goverment imposing it. Regarding to my thought on those doctor who exposed themselves with the patients, i do believe that they have the knowledge how to prevent themselves and they know better than most us what do to prevent from getting it.

It wont be surprise that you did open some of my mind in the discusssion. I myself is not a religious person , and yes i do heard the ""mark of beast"" theory and ""insert the chips into our body"". Dont be surprised that i do heard about 5g is related to covid-19 haha. I strongly oppose a vaccine passport and it is taking away our human rights. I do believe that we can win over this pandemic with the history of(Plague disease, Spanish Flu,although it is not a global scale).      I do heard of alot of funny theories on anti vacc as well haha. What i am trying to express is i do not want to blindly follow the crowd for the vaccine. I do not take vaccine due to peer pressure and i think for myself why should/shouldnt i take the vaccine. Do let me know if you have any question.

I guess if you grew up with a silver spoon in your mouth, you already know that it's not so great here but even then, I don't know. Everyone decides for themselves.   If you're in uni, many private unis have voluntary student exchange programs where you could do a maximum of two semesters abroad while still paying local tuition fees. It's still going on if you can find a placement during COVID, but it'll pick up again after all this. If you're not in school, just backpack and do unofficial jobs for some months and see if you find a reason to stay out there. Luckily, Malaysia has a very high passport power index.  I started traveling alone at eighteen and fell in love with Thailand and West/Central Europe because they are both very liberal places. Even their hardliners aren't as bad as the hardliners here. Malays look so silly when you come back. They freak out at pork and alcohol and not praying and LGBT people. Literal cave people from Plato's allegory.

Two core reasons, first being that the current vaccination program at any time risks being rendered obsolete when the virus mutates into a form that is completely immune to all existing vaccines. We're already seeing reports that say that Pfizer is less effective (AZ even more so) againts the India variant. Its been only about 18 months (21 if you count the 3 months China did an information blackout to hide the pandemic in its early stages in Wuhan) since the virus made its debut on this planet.  &amp;#x200B;  Second being that when herd immunity is achieved worldwide, most nations probably wont give a hoot about these passports because their own citizens are already vaccinated. This idea applies for most vaccinable diseases, where we dont have any sort of vaccine passports for them, despite some of them posing a much higher threat than Covid for a nation's population.  &amp;#x200B;  Honestly tho, I hope that Malaysia continues to accelerate towards herd immunity, and in the future make the vaccines widely available to the public via private practices. Once this is achieved, the need for ""vaccine passports"" will be drastically reduced, and by then we'd be able to dismiss the need for it. I think it will be a massive waste of taxpayer money anyways, as they will need to create a database to keep the vaccination records, and then they will need to pay the cops to run investigations on people questioning overbudgeting of the department.",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/o4msgd/health_dg_vaccination_passport_for_interstate/h2ijtcu/

The test involved taking samples from both nostrils + throat as opposed to the one nostril + throat sample in Malaysia.  Had no idea what was the destination until we reached. Will not reveal hotel name here till I have left. Received test results (negative) within 3 hours, scarily efficient, maybe cuz not that many samples to test d due to zero community cases.

To give a quick example ; we have already been inform to enter or exit any premise or conducting businesses, we need to showcase our fully vaccinated certificate via mysejahtera.    So why making this as a surcharge when it’s already a mandatory thing to do? Scanning QR code and showing vaccine cert as the first two things you need to do and having to know one of it requires payments to disclose, is just an unsavoury way to make money.    If the surcharge were to be on test result from the RM 19 test kit prior them entering your premise, then that’s sounds valid reason to consider for the added-services to pay.

82,31,0,1630462351,"&gt;My sentiment comes from the fact that someone I know who has underlying medical conditions and is at risk with vaccinations, will be excommunicated from society, even as her doctor advised her not to get vaccinated yet, so why would the government go against the mind of a qualified doctor on health issues? Is it me or does this simply not make sense?  If you have a medical dispensation against getting vaccinated, then that's fine.  Right now everything is a WIP. Our NSC is not a very agile body and you can see policies and guidelines being issued are slow or at times contradictory.  Yes, it sucks if you're strongly discouraged from being vaccinated and not being able to do certain things that those who have are - i.e. dining in, visiting certain locations et al.  But this is government. Government is not nippy and swift. In time I'm sure the guidelines will be issued for those who have not been vaccinated on medical advice.  On the other hand we have the other side. Takut, I heard my neighbour's second cousin's best friend's acquaintance died after being vaccinated, it's my body and my right to decide what goes into it! So many reasons. Sure.  But guess what, you don't live in a bubble. If you decline to be vaccinated for reasons such as those directly stated in the above paragraph, you're being selfish. Yeah, I'm sure I'll get brickbats for this comment but let's face it. We are in a D I S A S T E R situation. There is no reset button. There is no load save game button.  If you don't want to tango, then don't expect others to switch from the tango to the cha-cha because that's what you want to dance. (everyone else is tango-ing)  Eventually you're going to get to a situation where establishments have a choice and not merely following government guidelines. I work in a restaurant. The restaurant has a right to refuse service to you.  Even if the government says ""Okay! Everyone can dine in!"" and the restaurant CHOOSES to say, ""Sorry. Only those fully vaccinated can come in, please show your MySejahtera vaccine certificate as proof."" there is nothing you can say to overrule that. Sure you could take me to court if you like, but that again is your prerogative. Who knows, you might win after all, but then again, you might lose.  Likewise, shopping malls can say, ""Vaccinated only!"" and why is this? Because it's not a public space is it? It's a private establishment.  The only locations you can probably visit assuming restrictions are lifted are government establishments. Want to go makan, watch a movie, enjoy a theme park? If they say vaccinated only, again that's THEIR RIGHT to do so.  When it comes to employment that becomes a whole different ballgame altogether. Can employers terminate employees who decline to be vaccinated (without medical cause)?

""If you have not been vaccinated and do not have a digital certificate, then you cannot go.

To use an analogy, wearing seat belts can reduce car crash fatalities by thousand folds but idiots will still argue personal freedom and complaining discomfort and inconveniences.  &gt; Never have I ever seen a movement on this scale to coerce people into taking a vaccine, and to dehumanise those who don't comply.

The death rate of SARS CoV-2 is &lt;0.0115% in children below 12 (per KKM data). This is THE SAME as the death rate of the common cold in children below 12 (per CDC data). So why vaccinate kids?

As for the remarks on how other countries are handling COVID, do note that their strategies and countermeasures have yet to yield results.

So why vaccinate kids?  \- Why is the dominant strategy vaccines and not natural immunity? \[Japan recognises natural immunity on par with vaccines\]. The average person who has died from Covid already has 4 comorbidities (CDC data). UK estimates people who ACTUALLY died only from Covid to be about 50,000. Covid is a disease of the aged &amp;  immunocompromised. When was the last time KKM told you to eat well, get enough sunlight, exercise and boost your natural immune system?   \- The virus is real but the response of governments all over the world from the start of the pandemic has been unprecedented and a vast overreach of powers. It is clear, even as recent as today from Denmark, that lockdowns kill economies more effectively than it prevents Covid spread. If lockdowns worked, then everyone in the UAE (which has not had a lockdown since June 2020) should have caught Covid and died by now.  \- Goalposts keep changing. They took your fundamental human right freedoms under the guise of keeping you safe. Then they said you'll get your freedoms back when you get vaccinated. Then they said not good enough, get boosted.

144,25,0,1627399001,"Super long post incoming.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;instead of my friends who criticize me for leaving my job at this crucial pandemic time.  Always remember this one thing, your boss and your colleagues are just your boss and your colleagues. Believe me the company would leave you in their crucial period, even if you were loyal for years. A great boss is rare in Malaysia. At the end of the day, when you grow old one day you will probably look back and you won't even remember most of what you were doing in your 20s career-wise. But you will remember that mum and dad has always been there for you, no matter what. Trust me, all these corporate loyalty especially in Malaysia is just ridiculous considering the Malaysian median salary isn't even good enough to convince anyone that the company gives a shit about any single employee.   &amp;#x200B;  &gt;Just curious, how are you right now with handling your dad passing?  My dad passed at 59, my dad was a very flawed man. Had affairs, didn't spend as much time with the family as he should have. But he provided a comfortable life for us and gave us anything we wanted. I don't have a super close relationship with my dad like most modern families but his passing still had a huge impact on me. He was always very focused on work and career and I guess in a way I wasn't able to be his ideal son when he was alive, I had just graduated university and for normal parents this should have been enough. But my dad was working with limited time, he always wanted me to show him he could trust me to have a proper career and be independent.   Only when we lose someone, we think about the lost opportunities. He was just a few months short from watching my graduation ceremony, just 2 years short from watching me close my biggest contract in business. I always come back to the question, is he watching me? If he's around just a little longer how joyful he would be .  I wasn't able to see him beam with pride much when he was around, I wasn't given the opportunity to do that. When he passed I was only 22. I guess I personally do not care about showing off any achievements to him, I just wanted to see him very proud just for his last chapter of his life.   I lived with what-ifs for so many years and a part of me still do, but eventually we do move on. Life has to go on, and eventually we will close the book on the previous chapter knowingly or otherwise.  In a way, I accepted his flaws when he was alive and I wish I had done more for him and with him but eventually we all have to move on and life always finds a way to help us move on. I still think about him always, you will never forget your parents but it will be okay.   I really hope this pandemic goes away quickly and you and your mum are able to get that vaccine passport to go to Japan. The situation you have right now is the situation you have right now, at the very least we shouldn't give up hope for something just because it gets scary to hold on to that hope.

I'd like to dig a bit deeper to better understand where you are coming from, as I too have encountered a few anti-vax and vaccine hesitant individual.  From what I gather, it's not that you do not take the pandemic seriously, but that you do not trust the authority mandating the vaccine. Is this only at the local scale (incompetent govt), or is it in line with more of the global mistrust (globalist central control agenda)? If not can you help articulate your point of view? I can understand if the mistrust is local, and if the virus is only affecting the region. But seeing that the pandemic is global, and we can see the daily news  countries that have started to open up due to more vaccination, what else would it take to convince you to register? Also do you see any other way free people could tackle the issue of global pandemic without global coordination and support?     Secondly, do you work or have close friends who work with people in the medical field? Do you accept their concern that the longer the virus exists and is allowed to spread, the higher the chance for it to evolve into something more deadly? What are your thoughts on vaccination for people who work at the hospitals where they are exposed to infected people far more than the normal person?     There are many reasons for one to be anti-vax/vaccine hesitant, so is good to be able to have civilized discussion about it. From my own encounter, the most anti-vax person I have personally talked to at length, has a general mistrust of authority both locally and globally. She also came from a religious background that saw current events as fulfilling some biblical prophecy. At one point she also brought up parallels with the 'mark of the beast' to the vaccine, and vaccine passports being a way for the globalist to control human kind. It took a bit of convincing to show that we have always needed some sort of vaccine passport to travel to high risk area. It's just that this is a global pandemic the type we only see once a century, and everywhere is high risk, before the conversation could be brought back closer to reality. It took a few months of discussion before she decided to change her view on the vaccine.  Another vaccine hesitant encounter is not my own but that of a family member who had a friend who also adopted the wait and see approach. She did not register even when her age group has already long been called for appointment. I could not get any further details behind her hesitancy, other than she wanted to ""wait and see"". Unfortunately she contracted Covid in May, admitted to ICU, put on oxygen and had organ failure after 2 months. She passed away recently without her family by her side.  I'm not sharing this to scare you into registering, or forcing my P.O.V on you. Just to share my stories of people I have encountered (not on internet). If other people can share their experience with people they know ( in real life), or their own reasons for choosing not to vaccinate, please share.

154,35,1,1626106386,"Thank you for your kind response and a civilised discussion. I will discuss with you part by part.    I am from Penang. I am prone to be lone ranger due to my believe. Thats why i am very appreciate that we can discuss this topic peacefully. All my peers are FOMO(Fear of Missing Out) to get the vaccine and I am the only one who do not care about it and i carry on my life as usual. I dont spend much time on this covid issue and i would spend more time on earning money.      Basically, I do not trust the Globalist and the Phamarceutical Corporation. From the beginning of the first day , i felt like its more a Plan-demic than a pandemic. Its like everything is being planned from the first day. I remember i saw one video(i have forgotten what is the name of the video at youtube, i will send you when i recalled). It was posted at September 2019 and the video is talking about ""rehersal of containing a pandemic"" and coincidentally we have the pandemic. From my POV, it is like the Globalist is treating us like a clown. They want a group of mindless people who is obedient and easy to control.

I meant during MCO i do witness a lot of people not follow the SOP and do whatever they want, ie group activities w/o mask. Take Taiwan as a case study, they did impose a self lockdown prior goverment imposing it. Regarding to my thought on those doctor who exposed themselves with the patients, i do believe that they have the knowledge how to prevent themselves and they know better than most us what do to prevent from getting it. Props to the frontliners for taking care of this country during this pandemic     Yes, I do really appreciate a civilised discussion on this topic and you are one of the most polite person that i have ever talk with. It wont be surprise that you did open some of my mind in the discusssion. I myself is not a religious person , and yes i do heard the ""mark of beast"" theory and ""insert the chips into our body"". Dont be surprised that i do heard about 5g is related to covid-19 haha. I strongly oppose a vaccine passport and it is taking away our human rights. I do believe that we can win over this pandemic with the history of(Plague disease, Spanish Flu,although it is not a global scale).      I do heard of alot of funny theories on anti vacc as well haha. What i am trying to express is i do not want to blindly follow the crowd for the vaccine. I do not take vaccine due to peer pressure and i think for myself why should/shouldnt i take the vaccine. Do let me know if you have any question.     The following discussion is out of topic discussion. From your discussion , i can know that you are a kind and open minded person.

155,36,2,1626109868,"&gt; I mean, isn't the standard meaning of Islamaphobia ""an irrational fear of Islam and Muslims""? What other meaning could there be?  You'd think that, but this word has been used and abused in all manner of methods. Same way how sexism and racism has as well. In the game of identity politics, you simply check to see what boxes the victim checks, then accuse the ""oppressor"" of whatever those boxes are linked to. Suppose someone gets fired from a company. Based on their gender, race, age and even religion, they could now level a ton of different accusations towards their company, and even if the company is innocent in all these things, the PR hit would be massive.   Once again, identity politics is commonly abused as both a reactive and proactive method to wrangle a favorable reaction. Which is why I want you to specify what you mean by islamaphobia and not assume I already know.   &gt; Yes but this wouldn't be an irrational fear against Islam and those who follow it but an irrational fear of a certain sect of Islam, which is different.  Potato potatoe. The shia muslims would just argue its shia islamophobia.  Semantics is all it is.   &gt; I doubt this is about islam, it's moreso the implementations of their archaic actions, which they claim to be ""Islam"".  PAS could claim islamaphobia since these actions have never been fully implemented, hence these fears are irrational. I've been dealing with identity politics for more than a decade, and trust me, at the end of the day its not the rational reasoning that wins out, but rather the loudest and most SOB voice.   &gt; Disagreement or misunderstanding of following certain rules/laws of Islam is not Islamaphobia, it's just a set of preferences.   No its not. In Malaysia (Islam) as a general rule, conversion is usually irreversible. Not to mention your children are born into the religion, and will have a hard time converting out if they try. In some of the more primitive nations, attempts to convert will result in murder and honor killing.   &gt; (IMO Anyone being introduced into a damn religion would be quite shooketh, especially if it's an abrahamic religion).  None of the other abrahamic religions are this effed up about conversion and apostacy. Also, neither Judaism nor Christianity demand people convert to their religion before marrying one of their own. In other words, this is an irrelevant argument.  &gt; But it could be, and atleast in the states, it is. People are denied rights that others can enjoy because they are Muslim (like being denied jobs, housing,protection, etc).  Earlier you mentioned ""preference"". So let me ask you this. How do you separate preferences and oppression? What if society as a whole reject gay relationships? Its a preference for gay people to choose their partners, so if a huge majority of people in society prefer straight partners, would you consider it an oppression of gay people?   My take on the whole ""oppression"" idea is that its oppression if its done in the context where fairness must be upheld with the intent to cause harm. Note the extremely specificness of it. There must be intent to cause harm, and it is done in the context where the withheld service/products/treatment is offered to everyone else.   &gt; While I agree that many people use these words baselessly, they are actual things that plague society and should be discussed. Letting people get away with using these words baselessly actually worsens the problem. For example, if you call everyone racist, it would diminish the meaning of that word over time, making instances of actual racism harder to point out and solve. That's the whole point of me starting this discussion: to make people realise that they are not oppressed because they are Muslim in Malaysia, and to stop using the word baselessly because it's disrespectful towards those who actually go through it. Obv one reddit post isn't going to enlighten everyine over night, I still did it anyway coz I like discussing these things.  I think this is the part where we both shake hands because we both agree on the definition and potential solution of the problem, but disagree on where the slider bars land and specifics. Again my whole argument can be encapsulated with the following:  &gt;  Letting people get away with using these words baselessly actually worsens the problem.  Which again, is why I want people to specify and define their accusations before even giving them the time of day. Its pretty much built into the way I behave, which is why I respond the way I did. Its done in a way where people cannot accuse me of being unsympathetic, but at the same time its done in a way to out a liar if they are one.   Ultimately I think its best if people dont mix the concept of oppression with the concept of islamaphobia as it blurs the lines and just makes it even harder to define and discuss each topic. Oppression simply defines as the exercise of authority or power in a cruel and harmful fashion. Again, keywords being authority and power. A baker refusing to sell you a cake is not being oppressive. A group of bakers refusing to sell you a cake is not being oppressive. A group of bakers colluding to refuse to sell you a cake on the other hand, can be said to be oppressive, since by colluding againts you, they establish an authority or power that you dont have.   On the other hand, government servants engaging in these on the personal level can be defined as engaging in oppression, since they're obliged to carry out their duties fairly, and being a government servant provides them access to a variety of authoritarian powers to coerce you into complying. Case in point, if you tried to apply for a vaccine passport and the government employee demands a 1000% fee, you cannot refuse, because if you do, that government employee can file a police report againts you for running around without a vaccine passport. A private agency cannot do this, even if its within a corporation since there are and always will be methods to deal with this, including quitting, complaints made to the appropriate government body, and so on. Oppression can occur from a variety of things, and it often isnt done as a result of irrational fears. More often than not its as simple as a power trip, laziness, sadism or greed. People in power in general do not engage in petty oppression if they have an irrational fear of something; they take any and all actions to crush it as well as warn off future acts. This is why police in Malaysia take such harsh actions on people engaging in sedition, as opposed to... extorting people for money if they catch them with a packet of cocaine.",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/oiimbh/are_malaysian_muslims_entitled_to_say_i/h4xvn9h/

166,47,2,1624260912,"I'm still not sold on this whole vaccination passport idea. Two core reasons, first being that the current vaccination program at any time risks being rendered obsolete when the virus mutates into a form that is completely immune to all existing vaccines. We're already seeing reports that say that Pfizer is less effective (AZ even more so) againts the India variant. Its been only about 18 months (21 if you count the 3 months China did an information blackout to hide the pandemic in its early stages in Wuhan) since the virus made its debut on this planet.  &amp;#x200B;  Second being that when herd immunity is achieved worldwide, most nations probably wont give a hoot about these passports because their own citizens are already vaccinated. This idea applies for most vaccinable diseases, where we dont have any sort of vaccine passports for them, despite some of them posing a much higher threat than Covid for a nation's population.  &amp;#x200B;  Honestly tho, I hope that Malaysia continues to accelerate towards herd immunity, and in the future make the vaccines widely available to the public via private practices. Once this is achieved, the need for ""vaccine passports"" will be drastically reduced, and by then we'd be able to dismiss the need for it. I think it will be a massive waste of taxpayer money anyways, as they will need to create a database to keep the vaccination records, and then they will need to pay the cops to run investigations on people questioning overbudgeting of the department.",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/o4msgd/health_dg_vaccination_passport_for_interstate/h2ijtcu/
