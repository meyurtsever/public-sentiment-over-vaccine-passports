My situation:   I am South African and we only have around 200 covid cases a day atm but still we are considered a medium risk zone even though some European countries are at 25 000+ a day and low risk... don't understand that logic. Anyway so we needed to apply for the sandbox setup.  You can imagine how stressed we were about our vaccine certificate QR code not being recognised because South Africa is usually behind on everything or not even thought about before the richer countries so there was very little faith it would go through smoothly.  We uploaded through: - Gmail,  - Used ordinary passport - South African vaccine certificate + separate pic of vaccine QR code. Our vaccine certificate showed our ID numbers but not passport numbers (so I wouldn't worry about editing that in like some people have)  - For accomadation we just used our SHABA certificate which we requested from sha+ hotel and entered the SHABA number provided  into the booking ID part. - AXA insurance certificate showed specifically that covid is covered.   I was honestly the most stressed and strung out I have ever been, I registered a few times on different emails, because I was so scared I had done something wrong. I called my countries Thai embassy who could not help, I tried calling that helpline they provided but noone answered, couldnt sleep or eat.. But my girlfriend remained calm and only made one application without reapplying 50 times like me and at the end of the day we both got the approvals and she got hers 1 hour before me!!  That being said, the best advice I can offer is; STAY CALM. I have not seen many cases of anyone being out right denied yet, we are all rightfully stressing because we are in the first few weeks of the system operating and are essentially guinea pigs! I know it sucks but it had to start somewhere and I truly believe that as long as you made your application with at least 3 full working days to go I am pretty certain they will approve you!   One thing that I noticed did go through is the email to support@tp.consular.go.th they only answered me straight after I had been approved and said that I am already approved - lol-  but it was confirmation that the email line does indeed work!

64,0,1633876908,"Can you give an example of 2000% markups in Thailand.  I honestly can’t think of any.    I’m not talking about dual pricing when some street vendor in a tourist part of town tries to scam you.  That kind of stuff goes on everywhere in the world.    I’m talking more about national parks and similar where there is a posted Thai National and Foreigner price displayed.    There, I’ve only seen maybe 100% or 200% maximum.    And that would be off a base price that is ridiculously low to begin with, like 100 baht for Thais and 200 baht for foreigners.     Also, many of those things I mentioned in my previous comment don’t require substantial paperwork.  You picked the most detailed one as an example.  If I go to Disneyland, all I have to show is my CA DL.    A student only needs to show an ID card.  Etc.   I would also add, that “look” is basically laziness.  They don’t ask for every ID because if the person looks Thai and speaks Thai, there’s a good chance they’re Thai.    BTW, it works against them too.  My wife is Thai but holds American citizenship.     When I went to get my vaccination, it was only open to foreigners.  I walked right through and they never even asked for a passport.    She asked, in Thai, if she could get vaccinated too and they told her she couldn’t.    When she told me, I told her to go back and show them her American passport and ask again.    She went back and they gave her a queue number for the vaccine.    They were going to deny her because she looks Thai and speaks Thai.    But, in 99.99% of cases, it’s a correct assumption.  Just like when they didn’t even ask to see my passport.   I could be a naturalized Thai citizen, couldn’t I?     Given the high success rate and the low penalty for being wrong, combined with the added time it would take and longer lines, it’s easier for them to just assume nationality based on appearance.     What’s the harm if one Asian tourist pays the Thai price compared to the long lines that would be involved in checking every ID at the Grand Palace?

The first time i was out in around 45 minutes or so.  Second shot, i was there for 2 hours.  To get to the 9th floor you wait for really slow elevators as people gather all around you. Then everyone crams into the elevator up to the 9th floor.  The entire process is indoors in a narrow L shaped corridor.  There were 9 stops.  9. No reason it couldn't have been 2 or 3. Besides the around 150 or so numbers I heard called while i was there, there were dozens of workers (no wonder all these health workers keep testing positive).  Most of them were unnecessary and shouldn't have been there.  There were no accommodations for covid, it was just the usual snap the ""system"" into place and it hopefully fits what you're trying to do.  The number of people up there and the time spent there should have been limited at every chance.  Nothing was cut out and it could have just as easily been a pre-covid event.  And I don't think the spacing between chairs was sufficient at all.  But it doesn't even matter as much when you are in an enclosed space like that, worsened by the crowds.  The 30 mns waiting time should have been cut out for safety concerns. If someone feels unwell, they can return.  People should have been let go and allowed to remain in the area or not far away.  I've never had more than a cup of orange juice and sent away when vaccinated in the past.   Then i get handed a pathetic little piece if paper that says ""Thailand certificate "" for covid vaccine.  It's useless.  Then i was told I had to go to one of only three places to get a vaccine ""passport"". So i had to travel to nonthaburi arrived at 6AM and spent another 3 hours indoors with more people not really respecting social distancing.  One lady checks the papers, then you hand them to a lady at a window at 6.30. At 8 am she calls your name and hands them back to you, telling you to go upstairs where you start again.    So total I spent 5 hours indoors, not including two round trips traveling, in two days.  Probably there will be many posts following telling me I'm a shit head, been it's caused great anxiety.  I stayed in or traveled thru more than a dozen countries on 4 continent's since end of 2019, I've been safe so far, but so totally vulnerable the past two days.  Villa was a madhouse just now too, it's ridiculous.",Thailand,t5_2qjw5,/r/Thailand/comments/ob9tve/covid_information_travel_tourism_and_general/h5i5frf/
103,1,1626526211,"I have only had my first shot but it wasn't 9 stops. Once up the elevator it was 1 stop to hand the passport, 1 to see them again (this one seemed pointless), one to give them your filled in form and take BP/temperature, then recieve the vaccine then go to observation. The purpose of observation is incase you go into anaphylactic shock I think, it'll probably happen pretty quick after vaccination but you wouldn't want to be far from medical care if it happened I guess.",Thailand,t5_2qjw5,/r/Thailand/comments/ob9tve/covid_information_travel_tourism_and_general/h5iekfm/

As an expat, I will as well use my passport privilege, I am also preparing a trip with my family to get vaccinated in Europe and will not feel ashamed to come back Thailand fully vaccinated. I am enough of the politicians bashing on non-Thai people living in Thailand and theirs politics of « Thai people first » get vaccines. (I know that some expat here already got there vaccines in buriram or phuket but whatever…) If I have the ability to take action and get my family vaccinated ASAP, why not? My following comment may offend and this is not my intention as I am sharing my own opinion. To come back to the topic, from my point of view, Thailand is a narcissist society. -	make donation, take a group picture with the donation. -	go to the temple, take picture praying. -	go donate your blood, take a picture of your arms. -	feeling sick, take a picture on the bed hospital. -	Facebook account with 5000 people that you don’t know -	there is the same trend with restaurant/food but not only Thai people do it :) -	celebrities/idoles showing on theirs YouTube channel, Instagram, Facebook theirs life style and the privilege to get a covid19 test at home or complaining of the lockdown in theirs +300sqm property fully equipped.  In the article, Mint is showing off her life style during covid19 time, I don’t see any difference from my narcissistic list above.

105,0,1620285356,"&gt;I'd be interested to hear from people who are native to Southeast Asia (or  anywhere not in the US) and don't have residency in the US that did  something similiar how it worked.   I get the impression that vaccines are no longer in short supply in the US. That's definitely the case in Texas; I just checked, and the mass vaccination provider near where I live has over 1000 appointments available each day. And pharmacies and supermarkets have plenty of supply too.  I have some Mexican friends who flew to Texas to get vaccinated at a Walmart. No residency required, all the vaccine providers want to see is some photo ID with a birth date (Mexican passport works fine). Unfortunately, their trip was just after the US paused the J&amp;J vaccine, so they got Pfizer instead, and need to make a second trip for the second dose.",Thailand,t5_2qjw5,/r/Thailand/comments/n4obwa/thai_warned_about_vaccine_tourism_to_us/gx4iisd/
