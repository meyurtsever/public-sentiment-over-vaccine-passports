1,0,1643651841,"Your chances of seeing the aurora are greater further north, in the cold and dark season, and in an area without too much light pollution. You can download an aurora tracker on your phone, it will give you some idea. Tromsø is a good starting point (and it has a nice planetarium!), but you might want to go outside of town to avoid light pollution. I saw the aurora from the deck of ""Hurtigruten"" about one day south from Tromsø.  Some words of warning: In summer, the midnight sun will be up - no night means no aurora. Also, not every day has auroras, and if it's cloudy, you can't see it from the ground anyways. This means it's very difficult to plan. You need to be at the right place at the right time - a fair bit of luck.  Visiting the fjords: Yes, the fjords are open. Your idea of using Bergen as a starting point is sound, from there you can take a train to Voss (mountain/snow - great for skiing and hiking), or take a bus/boat to the fjords up or down the coast. And Bergen is nice in itself. However, Norway often has very bad weather, especially in winter. We just had a hurricane, and there have been avalanche-warnings... Do ask the locals on what's safe, what to wear etc: Nature in Norway kills a handful of tourists every year - don't add to the statistics.  As for culture, Norwegians are not very sophisticated. Some are rude. Most speak English, some speak French. There are also a few Moroccan expats, I am sure it's possible to get in touch with some of them via Facebook in advance. Also, due to covid-19 expect to have your vaccine passport checked at the border, and that you might have to wear a mask indoors in most public places.

So is it Vaxzevria or covishield?  I’ve read that article and it seems a bit ambiguous. It states:   ‘We are working on solutions to expand this system to include people who have been vaccinated using vaccines approved in the UK, the USA, and by WHO. At present this means vaccination with Covishield (the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in India), Sinopharm, and Sinovac. It must be possible to check people’s COVID-19 certificates using a QR code that is accepted by the EU Digital COVID certificate (EUDCC) gateway.’  To me that implies that they haven’t implemented it yet? I’ve spoken to the directorate of health and they said this batch numbers haven’t been approved, and then the directorate of immigration said it should be fine. So who am I to believe?

11,0,1632725201,"&gt;Ok so you are for segregation then, because some people cant medically get it and would not be able to go to certain places  Why is this always the argument you people turn to?  In the event of people being medically unable to have the vaccine, they would be qualified for this magical, mystical thing called a 'medical exemption'. That would mean that, yes, they wouldn't qualify for a vaccine passport that said they were vaccinated. But what's to stop the healthcare system issuing a vaccine passport that says ""medically exempt"" on it? So, they haven't been vaccinated, because they can't be, but their rights must be unimpeded because it's not actually their fault, so they get the passport anyway. I'll tell you what's stopping them - absolutely bugger all, and that's likely going to be what they do.   The only thing you're likely to find at this point is people who are, for whatever reason, medically exempt from the vaccine *may* be barred from certain job positions, since they pose a potential health risk. But funnily enough, that's already the case. People with certain conditions can't become pilots or lorry drivers. People on certain medications can't operate heavy machinery. It *already* happens. It's nothing new.  It's a really fucking *simple* concept, you know.  If someone is actually medically exempt (declared such by a real doctor), then the system has to accommodate them. Besides, most European countries aren't doing the 'no vaccine pass, no entry' thing. They'll still let you into wherever you need the passport for if you provide a negative COVID test from within 48 hours. So even for people who are *wilfully* unvaccinated, there's no 'segregation'.

Anything else can easily be done without for six months. I would not last six days with my fluffy friend!   As mentioned before, find a vet in the US that has experience with international pet transfer. You’ll need a pet passport issued a few days before your flight, and all of the necessary shots administered 24-48 hours prior to departure. Call the airlines *before* booking your own flight to make 100% sure that your pet can fly all the way through to your destination. Some countries will not even allow your pet to make a transfer in their airports, and it’s especially convoluted with covid.
