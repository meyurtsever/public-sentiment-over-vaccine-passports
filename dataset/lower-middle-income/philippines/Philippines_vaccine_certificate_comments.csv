5,1,1642690723,"&gt; MANILA- Public Attorney's Office (PAO) chief Persida Acosta hit back at Senator Franklin Drilon on Thursday after he said she should be barred from going to work physically due to not being vaccinated against COVID-19.   Acosta said that Drilon should not attack her personally, but instead go after Republic Act 11525, or the COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021.   Unvaccinated PAO chief must be barred from attending work in-person: Drilon According to Acosta, the law acknowledged the experimental nature of COVID-19 vaccines, mandated the creation of a national vaccine indemnity fund, and rendered vaccinators and vaccine manufacturers immune from suit and liability.   She said that under the law, vaccine cards should not be considered an additional mandatory requirement for educational, employment, and other similar government transactions.   ""Provided further that the vaccine cards shall not be considered as an additional mandatory requirement for educational, employment and other similar government transaction. Walang mandatory vaccination,"" Acosta said. ""Batas ho ito eh. Republic Act 11525. Bakit ako po ang kanilang pinepersonal? Eh di atakihin nila ‘tong batas na ito.""  (There is no mandatory vaccination. This is law. Republic Act 11525. Why am I being attacked personally? They should attack this law.)   ""Eh Kongreso po ang gumawa nitong Republic Act 11525? Hindi naman ako. Wala akong pirma dito.""  (Congress came up with Republic Act 11525, not me. I didn't sign it.)   She said it was up to a person whether they should get vaccinated against COVID-19. She also said that vaccines were still under Emergency Use Authorization, and that they should be given a Certificate of Product Registration (CPR) first before they are made mandatory.   ""Pwedeng i-mandatory vaccination, kung may CPR na ‘yan at proven na walang namamatay, walang nai-incapacitate, walang natatak, walang nagma-myocarditis, kahit sinasabi ng mga gumawa ng bakuna na ‘yan ang side effect. Eh kung wala, bigyan ng CPR,"" she said.   (You can do mandatory vaccinations if the vaccine has a CPR and it's proven that nobody will die from it, nobody gets incapacitated, nobody gets myocarditis, even if the vaccine makers said these are the side effects. If the vaccine doesn't have any of these, then give it a CPR.)   Acosta accused Drilon of not following the issue she initially raised, which was the supposed unconstitutionality of government's ""no vax, no ride"" policy.   ""Eh 50 million pa yung hindi nababakunahan eh? Eh di lahat ng hindi bakunado, hindi niya papasukin? Anong mangyayari ‘dun?"" the PAO chief said. ""Eh hindi niya sinusundan yung logic ng issue, dapat may major premise, minor premise, tsaka conclusion. Kung puro minor premise lang, ay walang katuturan yung conclusion na wag nang papasukin si Persida Acosta.""  (50 million Filipinos aren't vaccinated yet. So if they're unvaccinated, he wouldn't allow them to go to work? What will happen then? He's not following the logic of the issue. There should be a major premise, minor premise, then the conclusion. If it's all just minor premises, then the conclusion that Persida Acosta should not be allowed to go to work is worthless.)   But Acosta also said that she bore no ill-will toward Drilon.   ""Wala po akong masamang tinapay kay Sir Frank. Mahal na mahal ko po ‘yan kaya kahit na binabanatan niya ako parang siguro ‘di ko alam bakit galit sa akin ‘to eh binoto naman namin siya,"" she said.   (I don't have any grudges toward Sir Frank. I love him very much even though he's hitting me like this. It's like I don't know why he's so mad at me, even though we voted for him.)   Drilon said earlier on Thursday that Acosta should get vaccinated against COVID-19 since she was a government official. He warned that her not doing so could result in credibility issues for Manila's vaccination campaign.   The Senate minority leader added that he was ""open for a debate"" on a mandatory vaccination policy.   Health Secretary Francisco Duque III also urged Acosta to get the jab, saying that she was almost a senior citizen and should get extra protection against COVID-19.   The PAO chief earlier said that she was waiting for what she called a ""protein-based"" COVID-19 vaccine.",Philippines,t5_2qjov,/r/Philippines/comments/s8ktsp/unvaccinated_acosta_blasts_drilon_over_call_to/htgqn5t/

49,0,1626080425,"The EU's ""Digital COVID Certificate"", which is colloquially referred to as the EU's ""vaccine passport"" is a one-pager document that's supposed to make it easy for people to travel through and across the Schengen region by having a singularly-recognized, uniform declaration of a person's vaccination status.  It's this thing that supposedly only recognizes Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and AstraZeneca (specifically, the Western-manufactured version of AZ, and not the licensed versions of AZ from India, South Korea, or Thailand).  The ""rumor"" about Sinovac (and other vaccines) is based on how the Digital COVID Certificate has not yet been uniformly implemented across all EU countries, and __the EU has given its member states individual discretion on recognizing/allowing vaccines that the European Medicines Agency has not yet approved__.  For example: https://www.dw.com/en/which-eu-countries-accept-vaccinated-travelers/a-57808870  &gt; **People entering Spain** from what it deems ""risk"" areas — including many EU members and most other countries in the world — **can avoid quarantine requirements by showing proof of full vaccination with a jab approved by** the European Medicines Agency (EMA) or **the World Health Organization (WHO) at least 14 days before arriving**, proof of recovery from COVID-19, or a negative test.  [and noting here that Sinovac is included within this classification of vaccines approved by the WHO, even if it is not (yet) approved by the EMA]  &gt; **The Greek government** lists the following vaccines among those accepted: Pfizer-BioNtech, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax, Johnson and Johnson, **Sinovac**, Sputnik V, Casino Biologics, and Sinopharm.  In contrast:  &gt; France recognizes all vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency and considers travelers fully vaccinated two weeks after their final dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or AstraZeneca jabs, and four weeks after the single shot Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.  So given that France specifically does not recognize vaccines that are (only) approved by the WHO, and also does not specifically name Sinovac, then presumably a person vaccinated with Sinovac might not be able to enter France (without an urgent need/without undergoing quarantine), even if they might be able to enter Greece or Spain.  Or as another example:  &gt; However, fully vaccinated passengers with valid vaccination certificates are entirely exempt, no matter the color code of the country they come from. **Cyprus accepts all vaccines approved for use in the EU as well as the Sputnik V and Sinopharm shots**.  This means that Sino**vac** specifically would not count for Cyprus, even if Sino**pharm** does.  If you actually were going to plan a trip to Europe, and you were vaccinated with Sinovac (or Sinopharm, as in the case of the San Juan), you'd basically have to check on a per-country basis.

Of course, it’s still good to have the medical certificate or prescription on hand.   And at this point, I think they’re more worried about vaccines expiring than making sure that only A1-A3 get vaccinated first.

My suggestion is to wait for their announcements. Also, they might have new requirements because of the pandemic (such as Covid tests, vaccine passports).  &gt; hingiin ko po ba sa kanya yung required documents and ako ang magpapasa dito kapag nag apply na ako ng visa?  Yes, you will need to ask for these documents from your guarantor, and you will be the one to present. Also remember that the Japanese Embassy **doesn't accept** applications directly from applicants. You will need to find a travel agency that is approved by the Japanese Embassy and can submit the application on your behalf. Here are some of them: https://www.ph.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_ja/00_000256.html. They will help you gather and check your requirements. You will have to pay a fee.   &gt; Kailangan ko pa rin po ba mag present ng bank certificate ko? He mentioned that since he's gonna be the one who will cover my expenses during my time of stay their then I don't need to present my bank or pay anything.  Technically, you don't need to present anything if you have a sponsor. But I highly recommend presenting your own documents help because it helps prove that you do have some sort of money in your account and your ties to the Philippines.   Also, you need the latest birth certificate from PSA (issued within 1 year).
