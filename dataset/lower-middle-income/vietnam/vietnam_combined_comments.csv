My son felt sick &amp; messaged his boss to say he wanted to stay home &amp; see a doctor... his boss said to come to work or he'd be fired. This was the start of the shitfest. 

Locked in a room at school for 10 hours, no drink, food or his stuff. 
Transported to a military hospital. 
Being shouted at by military every time he tried to ask a question with Google translate. 
No results of any Covid tests given to him. 
After I got our embassy involved, transferred to a general hospital. He had to pay for his food. 
Brought by police to police station after 7 days in hospital... he still has no idea why. 
Brought home by police, quarantine for ""many days"" 

It's his boss who contacted the police at the start of all this. My son has no idea why. His boss apparently paid for the hospitals (1,400 USD) which he has to reimburse, lost earnings of the school due to the Covid outbreak, the ""administration fees"" to cover the extra work of  contacting police, hospitals etc. 

He hasn't overstayed his visa, but his boss fired him when he got Covid so his enforced stay will mean he is in the first month of having an expired visa ..... as if he's deliberately trying to stay. 

He has given his ex boss the blood money &amp; passport to get his exit visa. This takes 45 days according to the money grabbing bastard. The visa lawyer said it takes 5 - 8 days. 

One of the guys he worked with, pretended to beat up a colleague so he could complain &amp; he got deported. 

Another guy paid his school 2,800 for his exit visa on 29th December &amp; still waiting for it. He's living in a hostel in Hanoi with little to no money except what the other teachers can give him. 

None of them have been paid since the start of November &amp; this is happening in at least 6 schools...that I'm aware of. 

Thanks for taking the time to read my rant. Listen out for screams of joy in a few weeks when planes leave Hanoi with teachers on board...",VietNam,t5_2qkcr,/r/VietNam/comments/s7so22/whats_your_favorite_holiday/hthsllg/

For context, I’m a US citizen and I’m fully vaccinated with boosters for Covid and have a passport.

Are regular tourist visas even being accepted right now? 

I see there are tickets available to fly to Ho Chi Minh, but most either cost a lot or they are 50 hour flights. And I’ve read in multiple places flights from the US are limited to four a week and on a trial basis.

We get it, our passport are stronger, why do you need to whine and complain about it? Envy is an ugly color

&gt;Vietnamese trying to get to your country on a ""good day"", pre-covid would have been a much more brutal journey than having a few inconvenient layovers. Get a grip mate, you are crying because your preferred airline wasn't running and you had a few stops along the way?? What a joke!
&gt;That is what a little kid considers ""stranded"", because it was inconvenient for them. Ask your Viet friends how it was getting into Oz, UK, USA. You were annoyed? LMFAO

You're making a [false equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence), so nice logical fallacy. Are you aware even that it simply wasn't possible to enter Australia for quite a long time? You're way oversimplifying what's happened and showing your ignorance. Sure, there were flights but not as many as you think. A South African friend has been trying to leave the country since Nov but her flights keep getting canceled. An Australian friend of mine said he would've gone back home to wait out the pandemic but he was unable to enter Australia. (neither of those friends are on tourist visa FWIW) 

Also you may not realize this but many of the expats who have remained are people who have lived abroad for a very long time and don't really have a home to go back to. Many (probably most really) of those on tourist visas are older retirees as well who at this point in their life don't have family or homes back in their countries, they're too old to find decent work (getting a job is much more difficult for people who are retirement age in western countries), living expenses are far higher so they would have to go through much more of their savings than planned or find jobs. And it's not like there's a pile of jobs waiting for them back home. Maybe you can see why going back to their home country would be very difficult for some

My TRC runs out on the 22nd of December and I'm having to renew my passport before I can apply for a new one.

Unfortunately, due to covid, I was unable to get an appointment until the 15th of October to renew my passport, and now I am quite worried that it won't come in time to renew my TRC. Especially as I need a week for my company to sort out my work permit with my new passport. 

Additionally, due to covid, I'm obviously unable to do a visa run to Cambodia to buy myself a few months. Obviously I would also need my new passport to do this also as my passport is invalid once I've started the process of renewal, but this would usually have been an option if it arrived in time, but not soon enough to get my TRC sorted out. 

I'm especially worried about the possibilitythat my passport won't arrive a all until after December 22nd as I don't trust the ability of the UK government to do anything in a timely manner. However, if this is the case I'm really really not sure what to do as I'd be without my passport, nor the money to get a plane back to the UK (I'd also prefer not to have to travel back there.

* Can't afford K-12? Go sell lottery tickets. 
* Can't afford to put a deposit down on a hospital visit? Die or get out because there is no option of going into debt or setting up payment plans. 
* Every damn city floods horribly after the slightest bit of rain year after year.
* Dogshit passport. 
* Lose a family member to vehicular manslaughter? Did a loved one get raped? Tough. Take the money because the officials have already taken theirs and buried the case. There are no district attorneys just the police.
* Get fined, beaten, falsely imprisoned, or killed by the police? Sorry, the Party's decision is law and anyone who disagrees is reactionary that must be punished for abusing democratic freedoms.
* Starve to death during COVID because there is no stimulus package, payment freeze, or civil and human rights. 
* Homeless? You don't see the homeless because they're dead or pushed to the borders of Vietnam. There are no amenities for the homeless here.

""Many countries in the world have applied the vaccine passport to reopen and return socioeconomic activities to normal.

It takes me about... 1 month (maybe less, it's hard to judge the time when you stay indoors 24/7) to finally get the vaccine via my company. A week later,my ward also announce the vaccine stuff

* I download the app after my vaccine. So I don't know for sure if it can help you registering for the vaccine faster. However, it WILL give you the certificate for vaccine faster (the day after compared to the website's the week after)

Vaccination for foreigners is guaranteed by the gov. But down to the site, there may be some miscommunication (at least, as of 2 weeks ago, before the current full lockdown in HCMC) on this regards. A member in this sub has also suffered from it, but it was cleared out quickly (he has the ward level official) and he got the vaccine afterwards.

Best of luck to you.",VietNam,t5_2qkcr,/r/VietNam/comments/pcfthe/sinopharm_vaccine_suplus/haiwd9n/

I have seen many migrants get the shot but all were teachers so I don’t know where a non teacher migrant can apply.
Would have preferred pfizer or moderna but Happy I got my vaccine as the risks outweigh the very small risk.
The place I went to was in district 2 and was very well done.
A school with a lot of open places. They set up chairs with good distance, everybody had to bring their own pen prevent sharing of materials. Covid nose swab test first, wait for 30 min, get blood and temp checked, get shot, get certificate and proceed to a different exit without crossing people who are still waiting.

 The government of Ho Chi Minh City intends from today to all foreigners who live in Ho Chi Minh City (this means all 21 districts and rural districts of Ho Chi Minh City as well as the city of Thu Duc)  to submit a vaccination offer.  The responsible authorities at the place of residence will carry out the vaccination.
 Please register by September 15, 2021 at the latest using the web form provided by the Vietnamese authorities1.  You will then receive an invitation to the vaccination appointment by e-mail or SMS, stating the time and place of the vaccination.  This invitation serves as a pass to get to the vaccination center.  So please have them available for possible controls at checkpoints.
 We have not received any further information on the documents to be submitted, but we recommend that you carry your passport with you.  If you have a yellow vaccination certificate (WHO sample), bring it with you and ask expressly to register the vaccination.
 Please note: One registration per person is sufficient.
