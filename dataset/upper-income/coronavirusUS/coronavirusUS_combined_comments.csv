In order for the vaccine to end this, we need two things to happen.   1) People will likely need to get booster shots, right now we are looking at every 6 months.

As a scientist at [Johns Hopkins points out](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/a-new-strain-of-coronavirus-what-you-should-know)-   &gt; as with any virus, changes are something to be watched, to ensure that testing, treatment and vaccines are still effective. The scientists will continue to examine new versions of this coronavirus’s genetic sequencing as it evolves.  We have been lucky so far, no major outbreak of a vaccine resistant variant.

38,38,0,1618588141,"A mask, keeping distant, washing your hands, having a vaccine -- they all decrease your risk of transmitting or catching COVID, and they do it in an additive way. It's an odds game. Individually, each thing you can do improves your odds of not getting sick, dying, or passing the disease on to someone else who might get sick or die.  I'm not up on the latest numbers of asymptomatic vs. serious cases of COVID, but last I checked the estimate was somewhere around 30-50%.  Also, a lot of those ""asymptomatic"" cases are only asymptomatic in the early, incubation phase of the virus and eventually turn into serious cases. Asymptomatic cases are particularly dangerous in terms of transmission because the carrier doesn't know they have it --  Most reasonable people, knowing that they had COVID, would take extra precautions to avoid giving it to others. If you don't know you have it, you're likely to take fewer precautions and your risk of transmission is much, much higher, especially if you're not able to remain physically distant or if you don't wear a mask.  The reason the jab is important is because it makes your body more efficient at fighting off a COVID infection.  Most of the time, it can completely prevent the infection from taking hold, but in a situation where your body gets overwhelmed with the virus, it can help your body fight off the infection before it becomes too serious. The vaccines very significantly improve your chance of survival.  The reason people want the passports has to do with enabling them to assess their own risk.  Whereas if I walk up to a store and see a bunch of people indoors, not wearing masks, and being too close to each other, I can politely turn around and find another place to shop -- or come back when the shop is empty because I'm not comfortable being maskless around others while COVID cases are as high as they are in my area. With a vaccine, you don't have a physical indicator on your body to show that you're doing what you can to minimize transmission so the passports provide a mechanism to allow people to assess that risk.  If I walk up to a store or restaurant and I see a bunch of people indoors without masks on, but they have all been vaccinated and had to demonstrate it to a bouncer, I can decide whether or not I'm willing to take that risk.

They ignored the surge in the UK (that was more vaccinated and had more currently implemented restrictions at the time) and thought “naw, that won’t happen here.”  I’m aware that the vaccines curb the spread, although less effectively than pre-Delta. I’m very pro-vaccine!   But I don’t see how you can argue that getting rid of the mask mandate was a good idea. Even if Delta didn’t exist without a national vaccine passport system, it would never work. And it didn’t, instead it helped fuel the spread of Delta.   Another bad CDC call: letting the vaxxed off the hook for surveillance testing. This one is even worse because they haven’t changed their guidance yet, unlike the mask recommendation. There’s no epidemiological rationale to exempt the vaccinated from routine testing when breakthrough infections are as common as they are. If testing capacity is the issue, then we should use the defense production act or other policies to address that. The US’ testing system has been dismal from the start and is frankly embarrassing compared to the dozens of European and Asian countries that have managed to get it figured out.   Hundreds of epidemiologists (not affiliated with this “cult” sub afaik) disagreed with the mask guidance change at the time. Science isn’t always black and white.

There currently is little way to verify vaccine passports internationally.    The US vaccine ""proof"" is farcically useless, anyone can fake it with a printer. The UK &amp; EU are working together to tie their systems together so they can verify.    The UK released an app so foriegn countries can scan a qr code &amp; verify the document. They then match the signed qr document which has all your details embedded. If you modify it the document fails to authenticate &amp; if the passport doesn't match the embedded name you are in trouble. Countries will decide how well stringent to implement checks but countries have all the tools required to validate it now.   The EU system works roughly the same &amp; other nations are working on similiar systems. But for now if you can't verify &amp; authenticate its safe to assume they are unvaccinated. Hence why no ones willing to accept foriegn documents at this time.   The US given politics will never be able to provide a vaccine passport.

The CDC just decided people would be more compliant if it was ten days instead of 14.

160,103,0,1618588141,"A mask, keeping distant, washing your hands, having a vaccine -- they all decrease your risk of transmitting or catching COVID, and they do it in an additive way. It's an odds game. Individually, each thing you can do improves your odds of not getting sick, dying, or passing the disease on to someone else who might get sick or die.  I'm not up on the latest numbers of asymptomatic vs. serious cases of COVID, but last I checked the estimate was somewhere around 30-50%.  Also, a lot of those ""asymptomatic"" cases are only asymptomatic in the early, incubation phase of the virus and eventually turn into serious cases. Asymptomatic cases are particularly dangerous in terms of transmission because the carrier doesn't know they have it --  Most reasonable people, knowing that they had COVID, would take extra precautions to avoid giving it to others. If you don't know you have it, you're likely to take fewer precautions and your risk of transmission is much, much higher, especially if you're not able to remain physically distant or if you don't wear a mask.  The reason the jab is important is because it makes your body more efficient at fighting off a COVID infection.  Most of the time, it can completely prevent the infection from taking hold, but in a situation where your body gets overwhelmed with the virus, it can help your body fight off the infection before it becomes too serious. The vaccines very significantly improve your chance of survival.  The reason people want the passports has to do with enabling them to assess their own risk.  Whereas if I walk up to a store and see a bunch of people indoors, not wearing masks, and being too close to each other, I can politely turn around and find another place to shop -- or come back when the shop is empty because I'm not comfortable being maskless around others while COVID cases are as high as they are in my area. With a vaccine, you don't have a physical indicator on your body to show that you're doing what you can to minimize transmission so the passports provide a mechanism to allow people to assess that risk.  If I walk up to a store or restaurant and I see a bunch of people indoors without masks on, but they have all been vaccinated and had to demonstrate it to a bouncer, I can decide whether or not I'm willing to take that risk.

I'm more open to the idea of using something like this technology which is voluntary and opt-in, but instead of using it as a passport, use it to provide incentives. Like discounts and coupons. For those who have been vaccinated. So let's say you are going to a concert or a restaurant, you flash your QRC code and unlock a discount or get a free soda or something.",CoronavirusUS,t5_2f86o2,/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/mf57ox/new_york_rolls_out_first_digital_covid19_vaccine/gslrzej/

There needs to be more perks for vaccinations in order to encourage people to go through the hoops necessary in NJ to get a shot.  What I find really paradoxical is that lockdown skeptics tend to oppose immunity passports. They are the ones who want to return to normal life, and getting the vaccine and an immunity passport is the safest way to do it until we reach herd immunity! Might have something to do with fears of a National ID system, though.",CoronavirusUS,t5_2f86o2,/r/CoronavirusUS/comments/mf5568/would_a_real_lockdown_work_in_america/gslsk56/

I hope airlines insist on a ""vaccine passport,"" and other similar precautions are taken elsewhere to defend the responsible population from those who don't want to take the situation seriously.   Granted, at some point we'll have to let individuals decide their own level of risk tolerance, knowing that we may never get covid fully under control in this country. The question at that point will be whether those who don't want to take any precautions will be polite around people who, say, want to wear a mask at a concert.

By the time you can require forced vaccination at say an employer a lot of the ""wait and see"" people will have caved and we will be left with only 10-15 percent who don't take the vaccine. This number will be even lower since a lot of employers will require it.  It's really a slippery slope to go down the vaccine passport route, and it will be of limited utility soon.
