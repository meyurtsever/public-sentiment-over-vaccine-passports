The fine is calculated based on how long you overstayed, the people who work there are the biggest dicks on the planet to literally everyone, even if you're PM Modi-ji.  * You'll be given an a special exit permit which is stamped red in your passport and told to leave within 48 hours.  ---  Don't bother booking any flights before you've spoken to the FRRO as you'll be rejected at the check-in desk or dragged off the flight before it takes off, it's really embarrassing.

Also print out your hotel receipt as they will want evidence of where you stayed whilst you overstayed. I don't know why, it's stupid, but it's something they ask for.

Not only that what about the fact only 30% of the population is doubly vaccinated to reach a certain  level of herd immunity ? These are not complete protection, \*if\* a new variant strikes , which again can be a possibility there is a good chance the country will again suffer, not as much as the second wave but even then there could be serious problems and we could be forced into a lockdown if shit hits the fan.  70% of our population has taken the vaccine but a recent survey by India today showed 7% of the population still hesitant to take the vaccine. 7 % is 7 crore people (check source) . That number is big enough to create problems. Do I guarantee there will be problems ? NO. Do I fear there will be problems ? YES, as should you.

Vaccines dont work if some people take it and some dont.  The geographical distribution and climatic conditions of those who are unvaccinated could create new variants with localized outbreaks, which can snowball into something else. You should read a little more news before asking people what the fuck they are on about, reflects poorly on you.  Plan B was published officially on September 27.

They are thinking about it, its not a hypothetical. Last time around he tried to do the same deny a lockdown etc and then went on to impose it anyway , how sure are you things will be  different this time ? They might not jump up to a proper lockdown but a mask mandate, vaccine passport and  booster dose is still a real possibility , unless you have a solid argument to deny that they wont ever do it. Israel itself started with the vaccine passport again, what makes you think India is in a better position with 30% fully vaccinated, no booster shots, no kids vaccination in sight. The third wave is here, the cases will rise and the government(s) with its tail tucked between its legs will again impose 8pm curfew and compulsory mask in public.  Capabilities have improved, only because we have vaccinated the population.  I am not wearing a tin foil hat screaming 400k cases a day here, I am still looking towards a significant damage if we are all not too prepared. Which I feel we are not there. Since I am not an expert I will not throw out a random number ,but going by trends I am observing in other countries we might be looking at 100k cases in the third wave and that could be devastating.  Finally, I can very freely criticize the governments chest thumping whenever I want. The person on the chair has been hired to do a job and I am not that person. The chest thumping comment was an observation to what is happening, people have already started being complacent, removing masks and everything since ' capabilities have improved.' I was simply trying to put forward my assessment that the country is getting complacent and I stand by my words.

11,11,0,1634430415,"Just as a counterpoint - I’ve been living in sg for 15 years (or in context practically all of my adult life). This post is one persons viewpoint, and with selective/recent media attention on some prompts that were politically motivated.      There are few people that are racist. The Govt isn’t, and the people that I interact with (work, housing, hospitals, restaurants, malls, vegetable Mandi, bus/train/cabs) aren’t racist.      The racist overtones are from the opposition MPs (presumably looking for leverage in the voting masses). The rest is from online trolls &amp; ill-informed random people posting messages (for all you know could be non-state actors like China).         There is discrimination against foreigners in general, in jobs/housing/school admissions - but there is a clear rationale to prioritise locals (even if discriminatory in end results). It’s not like there is a board saying, “Indians and dogs not allowed”.  The other factor is that India and China form the largest block of qualified persons applying for mid level jobs and there is ratio/quota of locals vs foreigners. For applications for permanent residency or citizenship, Indians specifically lose out to China mainland applicants, as there is a policy to maintain racial percentages and Chinese are at 70% while Indians are 10% approx - so there is some background to why a Chinese colleague.          some Indians here have felt the weight of the rulebook thrown at them for minor infractions such as loud music at late hours, which in India might have been brushed aside with, “tere baap ka colony hai kya?”. Typical shit like trying to cut queues, bypass rules, treat service staff like “servants” - which obviously gets some people riled up as that’s not the local culture - contributes to a bad impression (though I’ll clarify that the locals I interact with have the sense to not club all Indians in one category, much as back home you’ll not club all Bengali’s as “yeh tho communist hoga”).        All that said, yes it’s difficult now to retain work passes, retain jobs and it’s a tough life. But that’s more covid related than racism.

27,27,0,1621346081,"I posted about it before, but I was done cobbling together a system that worked and then exhausted myself keeping it going through all the grift, inefficiency and corruption.   I'm not saying immigration is a 100% success for everyone - I've witnessed so much go wrong for people who only had hope for something better, but it was a risk I took and it paid off. I work at a company that respects and values my work and encourages me to grow professionally, bosses who aren't raging, micromanaging assholes, made 10x more money than I would have in India, learnt so much from colleagues who keep me competitive. It's quiet, have a small friends circle here and I'm happy.   My favourite thing about life here is specifically the community amenities I get access to - I pay a small fee to access the community rec centre over here. They conduct classes for the elderly for physical fitness, a full fledged gym and a full-sized swimming pool. FFS people who train professionally for the Olympics use this space for their own training (albeit with their own focused trainers) a few times a week. Just by virtue of living in this city I get free access to a library and can rent books for free, digitally or actual books. They even have video games for free rent or movies. The library also has ESL courses (I used to volunteer there and once covid is done, I'll go back to my other favourite thing to do, which was drop off book requests to elderly folks in the neighborhood) and resources to help people train for interviews. A while back they even had a 'legal eagle' day of the week where a pro-bono lawyer would be sitting there for people to ask for free legal advice. Come tax season, there's tax clinics to help the disadvantages sort their taxes out. I can honestly say that I feel more a part of a bigger community here and the willingness to give back vs back in India.  Another favourite thing is the one thing that actually gets thrown around as a disadvantage - the fact that you need to do everything yourself and don't have a maid/servant for anything. Personally, I love learning new things and doing things myself. There's a certain catharsis in seeking perfection in something you've done yourself. My dad taught me a little bit of mechanics work when I was younger (it was a must to look after my old '57 Bullet) and I know a little bit of carpentry (not to my dad's level, he built all the furniture in their first flat). Once this covid thing is done I'll be joining a community college shop class here in the GTA to teach me how to make stuff too. My landlord remodeled a bathroom last year and was happy to have me as a second pair of hands to learn how he did it, so now I know how to do tiling and basic plumbing, which is awesome.    Having said that, no place is perfect - Canada has its flaws too. Housing is overinflated here in populous areas with the govt. working actively to keep it that way than acknowledge it. Sure, the weather is difficult for 4 months of the year, but then again - where has India had idyllic weather? I'd be roasting my ass off in the humid Mumbai weather or wading through god-knows-what during the monsoons, so compared to that, how could you even complain about being nice and warm indoors or kitting up to walk around in snow for winter? You can fix cold weather by wearing more stuff, you can be stark naked in the heat of an Indian summer and still be roasting.   I still miss India though - there are some days where I have dreams that I wake up in my Mumbai flat and I go to catch the 255 Ltd to Oshiwara and the hustle and bustle. I'll always love and miss the portions of India I adored, but I cannot abide with the things that I cannot change nor like. I am still not averse to the idea of settling back in India at some point when I'm older, but I feel like I have the tools and ability to be my best self outside India.   A common criticism of this is that 'you are not contributing to improving the land you left'. This isn't really true either and I'm not obliged to prove my fealty - I have my own means of making an impact even though I don't live in India anymore and I shouldn't have to defend an action that is for the betterment of my countrymen. If every one of us took a step to uplift the life of at least young person around us and be the big brother/big sister to them, a lot of the problems we talk about - lack of education, lack of resources - would be effectively dealt with.There is a growing gap of not just financial inequity within India (which affects even the reads of this subreddit). There is a 'knowledge inequity' as well - a lot of the people that need help, need access to that help which could come from you to grow. They need that direction. I mentioned in an earlier post just yesterday that a majority of Indian youth don't have soft skills in a way that can help with their employability. Companies clearly don't want to invest in growing talent anymore because it hurts their margins.   What some people don't realize is that a majority of you have the capacity, even if it's limited, to be the world for someone else. For example - My sister and I are financially assisting my parents in helping a single mum (and daily wage worker) that lives in the basement of our building to look after her small daughter. That woman looks up to my parents and in return, my parents are doing their best to change that child's life for the better. We've both been sending care packages from here, we Facetime regularly and we get to see the little one too and she's started talking in two languages now - Kannada and thanks to my mom, English too. My mom is using the Preeti Sagar sing-a-long tapes she used when we were kids for the little girl too, and she loves it. I've already set up funds (mostly earned from Canada) to look after her education and materials and my dad is helping both the lady and her daughter for all administrative stuff, like getting their documentation and working through even things like passport applications. They're fully documented, my dad helped them get bank accounts, taught the lady how to use an ATM, how to buy basic appliances. Everyone is happy (my parents adore children and my mom misses teaching, so she's enjoying this, as is the little one; her mother is learning to be more independent and self-sufficient and gaining confidence in herself). We can sit and point at the failures of the government all day long for not having some of the tools people can use to be self-sufficient, but we are just as culpable if we don't work to do anything ourselves.   Anyway, that was my long post for the day - seeing these posts come up has had these thoughts in my mind for a good long while now.",india,t5_2qh1q,/r/india/comments/nezsm0/emigrate_used_to_be_a_meme_on_rindia_i_cannot/gykhrkh/

COVID cases were severe in US and UK too in the past 1 year, did they criminalise anyone coming back from there? Would they dare do that in future for citizens coming back from such powerful western countries? The issue here is the jail term and fine imposed to citizens coming back from India.

87,53,0,1639302110,"Just did a Canada to India non stop flight today. Going to share my experience to help others who are contemplating travelling to India right now. Documents: Needed 3 documents in order to complete the whole process as smoothly as possible: Negative RTPCR, Air Suvidha, Vaccine certificate. Upon checking in, air suvidha was required although info was not checked, vaccine certificate was scanned. I had already submitted my Covid test to air Canada while checking in online and so it was pre approved. Upon boarding, none of the suckers were requested.Here is the really surprising part: after landing in Delhi we were told by security present at the door to form a line and have our air suvidha and boarding pass ready. When I got to the front of the queue they only cared about the fact that you had a paper in your hand that resembled an air suvidha form. No information was checked or cross verified. In fact, the guy who was stamping my boarding pass did not even glance towards my air suvidha form once. After the boarding pass was stamped, none of the documents were required again. Overall I found the experience relatively easy and straightforward , it was probably more strict in Canada as the vaccine proof was requested two times in total and air suvidha once. In India only air suvidha was requested (but not checked). Also no one from my flight (as far as I can tell) was told to get tested again as part of that 2% group. Canada is not a high risk country as per India’s guidelines so the only “requirement” you have is to self-monitor your health for 14 days.",india,t5_2qh1q,/r/india/comments/r6zmeo/foreign_travel_guidelines_megathread/ho8akcd/

The difference between ARR and RRR is described very well [here](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2021/04/12/relative-vs-absolute-risk-reduction-500-doctors-want-to-know/). Both are valid metrics, and both need to be considered when looking at the efficacy of a new medicine or vaccine. However, RRR has the advantage of being independent of factors such as the age, gender or underlying medical conditions. As you pointed out, a 25 year old is at much less risk compared to a 65 yea old. But both enjoy the same RRR to any given vaccine.  Finally, in matters like this, we as individuals need to do a cost-benefit analysis. The vaccine is free in India and many other countries, so there is no monetary cost. You can walk into your nearest PHC with an ID card and get it. It has a tiny risk of causing blood clots (&lt;0.001%) and a much higher reduction in risk of dying from covid (0.13% by your calculations, for a healthy 25yo, and I feel that that is an underestimate).

Delhi handling the migration of other states workers)  * Govt. then poured money into research and development of vaccine and now we are so much capable that we are exporting medicines to 50+ countries.   * Govt. provided help in basic need of poor people who were totally dependent on God to save them. Gave them free and very cheap ration for months, gave money, motivated people in various ways.   * I don't say that only govt did this many organisations and peoples on their own did that but on the scale that it was i haven't seen that long line and satisfied people when they got free ration.   * Planning, managing and executing all this was done by govt and none of this is happened by जादू, various people in their field of expertise gave there everything to make this happen, some are no longer with us (ॐ शांति 🙏🏻)  Though govt collected funds but even then money was used by govt. own pocket.

It is used just to verify that you are the person who made the booking and not the other way around to prevent them from accessing your details.   They can pull up details of all people registered on a phone number and mark any of them as vaccinated. I also got vaccinated from my office. The process they did was to ask for phone number, check identity and mark us as vaccinated and then we proceed to get the injection. They didn't ask for the secret code. Same even for the drives that happened in our township premises.   I don't think this is some kind of coincidence that this happened on Modi's birthday when they were trying to create some sort of vaccination record. It has happened to people earlier as well whenever they were trying to set some record. But till now such instances were mostly concentrated in the BJP states which showed massive vaccination numbers.  Also, I talked to my cousin since posting and he apparently checked on CoWIN portal itself. He didn't get the message. He checked after coming to know that several people with upcoming due dates for second dose have had this happen to them.  I also doubt this was even done by any PHC. All the govt needed to do was relay an order to the administrators of the portal to get it done.

147,113,0,1631438374,"&gt;Over 72 crore vaccine doses have been administered since the vaccination campaign against COVID-19 was flagged off on January 16 this year by Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. To provide a proof of vaccination for each of these individuals, Co-WIN is already issuing a digitally verifiable certificate. This certificate can be saved on a digital device (smartphone, tablet, laptop etc.) or stored in Digi Locker from where it can be digitally shared as and when required as a proof of vaccination. Similarly, at entry points where such certificate is required (e.g., in malls, office complex, public events etc.), it may be shown in both the digital and physical forms.   However, there may be instances where an entity does not need to see the certificate in full and would just need to know whether an individual has been vaccinated or not. A few of such possible use cases could be as follows:   An enterprise/employer may like to know the vaccination status of its employees to resume functions in offices, workplaces etc.   ii) The Railways may want to get the status of vaccination of the passengers who are getting their seats reserved in the trains.   iii) Airlines may want to get the status of vaccination of the passengers who are booking their flight tickets, and/or airports may only want to allow vaccinated passengers to pass through.   iv) Hotels may want to know the vaccination status of the residents at the time they are checking into the hotel, or at the time of making online bookings.   As the socio-economic activities are being gradually revived while maintaining everyone’s safety, there is a need for a way to digitally convey the status of individuals’ vaccination to entities with whom they may be engaging with for any or all reasons, as employees, passengers, residents etc.   Therefore, there is a need to enable an Aadhaar like authentication service for the status of vaccination through Co-WIN. To take care of these cases and others that may come up, Co-WIN has developed a new API called ‘Know Your Customer’s/Client’s Vaccination Status’ or KYC-VS. To use this API, an individual needs to enter his/her mobile number and name. Thereafter, they will get an OTP which they have to enter. In return, Co-WIN will send a response to the verifying entity on the individual’s status of vaccination, which will be as follows –   0 - Person is not vaccinated   1 - Person is partially vaccinated   2 - Person is fully vaccinated   This response will be digitally signed and can be shared instantly with the verifying entity. A real-life example could be when at the time of booking a railway ticket, an individual will input the necessary details for buying the ticket and if required, the concerned entity will also get the vaccination status in the same transaction, with the due consent of the individual.   KYC-VS will facilitate all such use cases and more. It is both consent-based and privacy preserving. Additionally, in order to facilitate quick integration and faster adoption, the Co-WIN Team has prepared a webpage with the API, which may be embedded in any system. This will allow for a seamless integration with any system in no time.   Besides the use cases pointed out, this service may be utilized by any service provider, private or public, for whom verifying an individual’s vaccination status is critical for facilitating a service requested.

194,160,0,1626242298,"There is a smidgen of truth in your points. However it is not enough to absolve the govt.   Yes the US and UK invested in the vaccine research, so they would always have a leg up. That's fine, but they didn't ask us to delay placing orders until Jan 2021, days before we began the vaccination campaign. Other countries had placed orders in the middle of last year.   Even when we did order, we ordered 14M doses, which is barely enough to vaccinate *Bangalore*, let alone the whole country.   And then there was the absolutely insane strategy of having three different types of buyers (union govt, state govts and private hospitals) face off against a duopoly of vaccine producers. In fact it was effectively a monopoly because covaxin production numbers are negligible compared to covishield. Any economist can tell you that a market where there's a monopoly against a fragmented group of buyers, heavily favors the monopolist. The govt created this monopoly/duopoly by allowing only two vaccines for several months. And this resulted in India paying more for vaccines than other countries that were importing the same vaccines from India. So far nobody has been able to explain the rationale behind creating this massively complex system.   Does this mean we wouldn't have problems if the govt had acted correctly? No. Vaccination across the world has faced challenges due to supply chain issues, embargoes and patent laws leading to vaccine apartheid. For these the western world can and should be held accountable. But the Indian govt made many unforced errors and persisted with them even when it was clear that their moves were having devastating consequences.

Thanks for putting it so succintly. And also thanks for not jumping at me, everybody is too busy with downvotes just because I asked a question. Although I guess someone might think I'm sealioning, and since this policy has resulted in so many deaths, I cant really complain.  From what I'm understanding, India allocated 35k crores for vaccine procurement. However it placed its orders too late(should have been placed \~aug 2020, but was placed in jan 2021), and that too a very negligibile amount of orders were placed. Just 16M doses amounting to \~600crore, which is a very tiny % of the 35000 crore alloted.  So that proves that India had the money to place orders, and thereby increase production of vaccines, but chose not to out of hubris. Shameful.

Wierd how you show a complete inability to understand the changed reality of Indian politics since modi came to power. What's MMS equivalent of vaccination certificate with his photo?

260,226,2,1621504610,"So yesterday afternoon I got my first dose of Covishield vaccine at one of the Apollo hospitals in Chennai. It was a relatively smooth process, and I will share the process in brief so that it can be helpful for you to plan for your vaccination:  (1) Booking vaccination appointment: Finding a slot &amp; booking on the Cowin portal is not an easy task. However, there are many apps/tools that can help in doing that &amp; I used the Paytm app - Vaccine Finder tool to search for available slots in Chennai. If you are unable to find a slot, don't worry - the Paytm tool has a very useful option for sending us Notifications whenever slots are opened. For that, you need to keep the Paytm app minimised/put in the background of your smartphone. Then, whenever slots are opened, you will get a Notification mentioning the hospital name, pincode &amp; no. of slots available. Then, immediately open the Paytm tool through which you can login to the Cowin portal &amp; check the slots which have become available &amp; book your appointment. Please note that this process needs to be done very rapidly, like even a few seconds delay can cause you to miss the booking! Think of like Tatkal booking, but 10x more difficult!!! After trying for three days continuously, finally I managed to book a slot by sheer luck!  (2) Preparing for the appointment: Once appointment is booked, please download the PDF confirmation of the same on your mobile phone. If possible, better take a printout &amp; carry it with you. Also, please ensure to take your Aadhar Card original with you to the Hospital (AADHAR CARD IS COMPULSORY. If you don't bring it, they will refuse to vaccinate you) &amp; also take a pen and notebook as you may have to fill out some forms at the Hospital.  (3) Travel to the vaccination center: This is a bit of a hassle now, as Chennai police are enforcing strict lockdown, they are not allowing two-wheelers or autos to travel from one locality to another. There are barricades at all road junctions &amp; police are stopping all vehicles and asking questions. However, if you have a personal car or booked an Uber/Ola cab to go to the Hospital, then the police won't bother you. Please be ready to show your appointment PDF document or printout whenever they ask. I personally was questioned at two junctions &amp; after I showed my printout &amp; Aadhar Card, they allowed me to proceed.  (4) At the hospital - initial formalities: Upon reaching the Hospital, I was asked to fill out a form with my personal details as well as Aadhar number &amp; Appointment code. We were asked to wait outside in a covered Parking Lot with seats sufficiently spaced out from each other to ensure social distancing. There were around 20-25 people seated there &amp; mask wearing was strictly enforced by the security. They called 10 people at a time to enter the hospital, did temperature checks &amp; offered sanitizer to clean our hands before entering. Once entered, we had to go to the billing counter where they checked my documents, asked me if I have any cold/fever/any comorbidities &amp; since I didn't have any, they asked me to proceed with making the payment of Rs. 850/- (as right now Apollo are offering only Paid Covishield vaccine for 18-45 age group). Then we were asked to wait inside. This entire waiting &amp; formalities process took around 30-40 mins.  (5) Vaccine injection: A few mins after being seated, I was called inside a room to take the vaccine injection. They showed me the Covishield vaccine vial &amp; injected the vaccine as a single syringe shot in my left arm (similar to a Tetanus injection). Afterwards, I was told be seated in another waiting room for 20 mins just to observe if I get any adverse reactions to the vaccine dose.  (6) Completion of formalities: While waiting inside the room, within 5-10 mins, I got an SMS confirmation reg the vaccine 1st dose I had taken &amp; it gave me a link to open/download the Vaccination Certificate PDF &amp; I was able to download it easily. Once the 20 mins waiting time was over, I left the Hospital to head back home.  (7) Travel back to home: While returning back home, as usual police checking at each road junction, but no issues &amp; I was able to reach home easily. I didn't get any tiredness or sickness that we were warned about getting after taking vaccine shot, so it was good.  (8) Post vaccine illness/symptoms: I luckily didn't get any major symptoms like fever or body pain, but at night I did feel little tired &amp; with slight headache. However since today morning I am feeling fine &amp; normal. So far so good.  That was my experience with getting 1st dose of Covishield vaccine in Chennai.

265,231,1,1621366473,"Good news, bad news for the three of you - /u/homosapien2014 , /u/Assasin-ed and /u/corporatededmeat. I'm currently sitting at home riding out a sick day from my vaccine shot and since my work has a strict 'No disturbance during a sick day' policy, I have some time to recover, think about what you've mentioned and document it all here, so enjoy.   Let's start with some general notes:   a) **This is strictly about finances.** How your educational and other factors really help to determine eligibility overall, but those can be worked on too.   b) **Assumptions.** I'm assuming in this case that both of you have at least a Bachelors' degree (quite possible) and are (likely) unmarried, given your ages.   c) **Canada as Frame of Reference:** I will be using Canada as a frame of reference for discussions, but you can do your research on other immigration programs to chart out what it would be for other countries - Aus/NZ/EU, etc.   d) **Timelines:** Your move to said country will not be immediate - you need to think long term and your long-term planning needs to be sound because it's not something you can action immediately. You need to do the groundwork, plan and prepare. So if you're thinking about going tomorrow, or next year - stop. What I'm going to talk about below is basically what you need to build towards to breeze through it when you're ready so as soon as the final step is in place, you're a go.   e) **CRS Scores:** When I qualified for the program, I scored a rather high CRS score of 481 which allowed me to move quickly. [Here's a breakdown of my score.](https://i.imgur.com/GDhPLBt.png) But I had something that (I'm assuming) you don't, which was a Masters degree that gave me some more points in the CRS score. For a considerable chunk of points, you should be looking at the following:   i) Under 30 years of age (ideally, unmarried gives you better points than married does, but more on that later)   ii) At least 2 - 3 years of work experience under the NOC code you're applying under  iii) High IELTS General scores - we're talking 8.0 and above on every section, no exceptions  iv) Something that's equivalent to a Bachelor's degree, as per WES. They have an estimator on their website. Obviously, if you have a Master's degree and it is Ontario-equivalent, nothing like it!  [You can find out your current CRS scores here.](https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp)   Now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about specifics:  #Age  **All of you have an advantage here. You're young!** I first thought about moving when I was 28 - I landed in Canada in a month after I turned 30. A lot of the available programs for now really start to penalize you for age after 30, so you all should score high marks in this sector. Additionally, the later you move, the harder it could be to adapt because there's good chance you'll need to start your working life in Canada a rung or two below the position you had in India.   #Current Savings  Before we begin, let's work on trying to build up a 'shopping list' of items that are going to be a part of this adventure:   1. [Proof of Funds](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/proof-funds.html): This is what the government asks you to show that you'll be able to support yourself in your new life in Canada. This is a sliding scale that depends on the number of applicants in your application. In case you do plan to get married between now and then, see one of the sections below about it. Assuming 1 person, for now, the current amount is CAD 12,960 (with today's current forex because of the abnormally high CAD atm, is around INR 7,85,394.92 as of writing this, so around 8 lakhs.)  2. [PR Application fees:](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/apply-permanent-residence.html) CAD 1,325 or INR 80,288.37 , or around 80.5k INR  3. [WES Certification of your degree to show its equivalency to a Canadian bachelors:](https://www.wes.org/ca/evaluations-and-fees/eca/) 220 CAD, or INR 13330.90, so around 13.5k INR  4. [IELTS General Test](https://www.britishcouncil.in/exam/ielts/dates-fees-locations) INR 14,700  5. [India PCC Application](https://www.passportindia.gov.in/AppOnlineProject/fee/feeInput): You'd need to get this done at some point towards the middle of the process. Costs INR 500  6. [PR Medical Expenses](https://www.lilavatihospital.com/Visa-Investigation): Costs associated with doing your medicals for the PR process towards the end of the process itself. Typically costs around  5,000 - 9,000 INR. I got mine done at Lilavati back in 2016, and it was around 7,000 INR.   Those are what I'd call 'The big 6' costs, of which the 'Proof of Funds' isn't even really a cost at all; they're literally showing your savings that you intend to use when you land in Canada. You only need to show you have this and that it's not with any strings attached and you're in the clear.   ***So, with the five real costs outlined, you're looking at a final total of 1,15,819.27, aka 1.15 lakh INR. So with your Proof of Funds, that's about 9.15 lakhs at a minimum.***  Now, there could be other miscellaneous items associated with this too:  a) If you lived in any country other than India (whose cost was already mentioned above) for longer than 6 months within the past 10 years before you plan to apply, you gotta produce a Police Clearance Certificate for each country. That cost can vary depending on the country but it's not terribly expensive relative to the other options outlined above.  b) Married at the point of application? Effectively double some of those expenses, because there are two of you.  c) Training material for IELTS, courier costs...this is going to depend on how you approach it.     Now, to come to specifics on this:   **/u/homosapien2014 :**   You stated 6L as your savings and 13L as your earning capacity for now, you're sitting pretty. You're already about 60% away from the target you need to hit financially.   **/u/Assasin-ed :**   You stated 50k. I wouldn't say you're in bad shape per se, you're also young and my earnings as an artist back then were similar to yours so I can relate.   Having said that, you have ways to go on that front, but again, it's not impossible. Something that nobody tells you is that your family and friends have the ability to 'gift deed' you the balance amount as a way of raising your Proof of Funds. I'm not going to comment on whether that's a possibility in your situation, but I wanted to put it out there as a valid option for you to pursue. I know someone who did that; their dad gave them 5 Lakhs as a gift deed and when he came to Canada and settled in, he earned that money back in short order and gifted it back to his father and bought them a car as a way of saying thank you. 'Nary a dry eye in the audience, etc.   Additionally, like I said before - you're young, your earning capacity can grow and you need to focus on saving. You have a runway of at least 5 years to get the above together.   **/u/corporatededmeat :**   You stated 10L (*Sirf dal kha rahe ho kya, bc?* I didn't have nearly that much in savings when I was 24, lol :D)  Good news for you too, you're already there savings-wise, savings wise but you should add some more and get to work on that work experience, seeing as you're a fresh grad.   **Now, the million-dollar question - what do you need to do to prepare?**  1. Sit down, pen and paper out timelines. Look up the pre-requisites like I mentioned above.   2. Use the first free consultations of a few migration consultants (except Y-Axis, they're *chors*) to get a sense of if you're on the right track. I did this and I found that they were useful and going to them prepared also allows you to see right through their bullshit because often they'll have their own racket going on. Had one of those nitwits tell me my WES ECA was 'wrong' so they'd need to order a fresh one for me. He can suck it, I made it through just fine so he was full of shit and wanted to pocket some extra money because he quoted double what the WES site was actually charging.   3. For things you're not certain about, go [here](https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-discussion-board/) - This is the one source of truth for anything you need to know about Canadian immigration, for example. There will likely be similar communities on Facebook or the internet for the chosen country you want to go to.   4. Set up goals - set up a financial account for immigration money, send your savings there, take stock of how much you've reached for Proof of Funds and for the big 6 expenses. Keep a regular track of this and keep an ear to the rails if something changes so you can modify the plan accordingly. Similar, set milestone dates for when you should start work on getting some stuff done - I can tell you right now that getting the WES is a painful experience because it depends on your university giving a specific document and either mailing directly to them (you know what grade A *chutiyas* Indian colleges are so good luck lol) or giving you a sealed, stamped envelop with the transcripts that you mail to WES for approval.   5. Start digitizing your documents, like... ALL your documents. From your birth certificate to your passport, start scanning and saving two versions of it. A high quality, high file size 'Original Master' and a compressed low-quality version. You'll need to refer to this a lot when you apply. Pay stubs, income tax filing, bank statements, everything. Download and store everything, set up reminders to download this stuff online or go into your bank branch and have them give you everything signed and stamped for your accounts and keep it. You're going to be likely printing out enough paperwork for the application to massacre a small forest, so best be prepared for it ahead of time.",india,t5_2qh1q,/r/india/comments/nezsm0/emigrate_used_to_be_a_meme_on_rindia_i_cannot/gylvdxv/

Not very close people, but not very distant acquaintances either. For one of those, the viral load was too heavy. That person was 81 years old. Even doctors refused to come and check to just declare him dead. The people at cremation center couldn't take the body without the death certificate. They finally advised the relatives to declare him 'bevaras' (don't know term in English), so they could cremate him. This man, loved by a big family had to go as if he was an unidentified dead body...  Out of four of those people, everyone had had first dose of vaccine, and two of them (in their 50s) had both.  I was talking to a doctor yesterday. I casually asked 'you must have had your vaccination.' She said that she did have, but she and her 3 doctor colleagues (including her doctor husband) did anti-body test post-vaccination just to check. All of them had nil antibodies. All of them are still at exactly the same risk.  This time last year, the fear was more of intellectual kind.

316,282,0,1617178556,"&gt; Brazilian health regulator Anvisa said Bharat Biotech's Covaxin Covid-19 does not meet its manufacturing standards, according to a note in the Tuesday edition of the official gazette.    The Brazilian government signed a contract last month to buy 20 million doses of the Indian drugmaker's vaccine. Bharat Biotech applied for emergency use of the vaccine in Brazil on March 8.    &gt;   &gt;Bharat and its Brazilian partner Precisa Medicamentos said in a statement that they would appeal the decision and would present evidence that it is complying with all requirements.   &gt;   &gt;Covaxin has been approved for use in five countries, including India, the statement said.

317,283,1,1617238431,"https://indianexpress.com/article/india/bharat-biotech-covaxin-brazil-7253118/  &gt; Brazil’s health regulator has rejected an application to give Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin a certificate of Good Manufacturing Practices following an inspection of the company’s site in Hyderabad earlier this month.   &gt; An inspection by Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitari (ANVISA) from March 1-5 revealed issues related to the Hyderabad-headquartered vaccine maker’s manufacturing processes. According to the regulator, these issues could potentially risk the quality of the vaccine, and the action plan it sent was not sufficient to mitigate the risks.  &gt; “The requirements pointed out during inspection will be fulfilled, the timelines for fulfillment is under discussion with the Brazil NRA and will be resolved soon,” stated Bharat Biotech in response to the issue.  &gt; According to ANVISA’s statement on its decision, different non-conformities were found at Bharat Biotech’s manufacturing site that denote a significant risk to the manufacture and product quality assurance. This, in turn, implies a health risk for users of the vaccine in Brazil, according to the regulator.  &gt; **Major issues flagged include safety-related observations that the company had not validated the method of analysis to prove complete inactivation of the virus (to prove that it was killed). According to ANVISA, considering that Covaxin is an inactivated vaccine, the company needs to ensure that the virus was completely inactivated, otherwise live SARS-CoV-2 viruses may be present in the vaccine.**  &gt; The regulator also felt that the **company was not taking all the necessary precautions to guarantee the product’s sterility and a lack of adequate control strategies to guarantee the vaccine’s purity.**  &gt; Other observations were that **the company does not use a specific control method to quantify the antigen content and potency of the vaccine** . The vaccine may have **variations in antigen content and consequently compromise its effectiveness** , according to the regulator.  &gt; Precisa Medicamentos **presented an action plan on March 17** to resolve these issues, but the **measures effectively adopted so far have not been sufficient to mitigate the risks associated with the non conformities indicated** , according to ANVISA.  &gt; “If ANVISA has inspected this facility and found it not meeting its standards, it has options to say it will never buy this product or to ask the company to make corrections so that it can take a call after another inspection,” said vaccine expert Dr Gagandeep Kang, Professor, Christian Medical College-Vellore.  &gt; “The company should take it very seriously and our regulator should take it very seriously, and either do an independent inspection and confirm whether there really is a problem that needs to be corrected or push back,” she added.

These are not complete protection, \*if\* a new variant strikes , which again can be a possibility there is a good chance the country will again suffer, not as much as the second wave but even then there could be serious problems and we could be forced into a lockdown if shit hits the fan.  70% of our population has taken the vaccine but a recent survey by India today showed 7% of the population still hesitant to take the vaccine. 7 % is 7 crore people (check source) .

They are thinking about it, its not a hypothetical. Last time around he tried to do the same deny a lockdown etc and then went on to impose it anyway , how sure are you things will be  different this time ? They might not jump up to a proper lockdown but a mask mandate, vaccine passport and  booster dose is still a real possibility , unless you have a solid argument to deny that they wont ever do it. Israel itself started with the vaccine passport again, what makes you think India is in a better position with 30% fully vaccinated, no booster shots, no kids vaccination in sight. The third wave is here, the cases will rise and the government(s) with its tail tucked between its legs will again impose 8pm curfew and compulsory mask in public.  Capabilities have improved, only because we have vaccinated the population.

Since I am not an expert I will not throw out a random number ,but going by trends I am observing in other countries we might be looking at 100k cases in the third wave and that could be devastating.  Finally, I can very freely criticize the governments chest thumping whenever I want. The person on the chair has been hired to do a job and I am not that person. The chest thumping comment was an observation to what is happening, people have already started being complacent, removing masks and everything since ' capabilities have improved.'

351,32,0,1621366473,"Good news, bad news for the three of you - /u/homosapien2014 , /u/Assasin-ed and /u/corporatededmeat. I'm currently sitting at home riding out a sick day from my vaccine shot and since my work has a strict 'No disturbance during a sick day' policy, I have some time to recover, think about what you've mentioned and document it all here, so enjoy.   Let's start with some general notes:   a) **This is strictly about finances.** How your educational and other factors really help to determine eligibility overall, but those can be worked on too.   b) **Assumptions.** I'm assuming in this case that both of you have at least a Bachelors' degree (quite possible) and are (likely) unmarried, given your ages.   c) **Canada as Frame of Reference:** I will be using Canada as a frame of reference for discussions, but you can do your research on other immigration programs to chart out what it would be for other countries - Aus/NZ/EU, etc.   d) **Timelines:** Your move to said country will not be immediate - you need to think long term and your long-term planning needs to be sound because it's not something you can action immediately. You need to do the groundwork, plan and prepare. So if you're thinking about going tomorrow, or next year - stop. What I'm going to talk about below is basically what you need to build towards to breeze through it when you're ready so as soon as the final step is in place, you're a go.   e) **CRS Scores:** When I qualified for the program, I scored a rather high CRS score of 481 which allowed me to move quickly. [Here's a breakdown of my score.](https://i.imgur.com/GDhPLBt.png) But I had something that (I'm assuming) you don't, which was a Masters degree that gave me some more points in the CRS score. For a considerable chunk of points, you should be looking at the following:   i) Under 30 years of age (ideally, unmarried gives you better points than married does, but more on that later)   ii) At least 2 - 3 years of work experience under the NOC code you're applying under  iii) High IELTS General scores - we're talking 8.0 and above on every section, no exceptions  iv) Something that's equivalent to a Bachelor's degree, as per WES. They have an estimator on their website. Obviously, if you have a Master's degree and it is Ontario-equivalent, nothing like it!  [You can find out your current CRS scores here.](https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp)   Now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about specifics:  #Age  **All of you have an advantage here. You're young!** I first thought about moving when I was 28 - I landed in Canada in a month after I turned 30. A lot of the available programs for now really start to penalize you for age after 30, so you all should score high marks in this sector. Additionally, the later you move, the harder it could be to adapt because there's good chance you'll need to start your working life in Canada a rung or two below the position you had in India.   #Current Savings  Before we begin, let's work on trying to build up a 'shopping list' of items that are going to be a part of this adventure:   1. [Proof of Funds](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/proof-funds.html): This is what the government asks you to show that you'll be able to support yourself in your new life in Canada. This is a sliding scale that depends on the number of applicants in your application. In case you do plan to get married between now and then, see one of the sections below about it. Assuming 1 person, for now, the current amount is CAD 12,960 (with today's current forex because of the abnormally high CAD atm, is around INR 7,85,394.92 as of writing this, so around 8 lakhs.)  2. [PR Application fees:](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/apply-permanent-residence.html) CAD 1,325 or INR 80,288.37 , or around 80.5k INR  3. [WES Certification of your degree to show its equivalency to a Canadian bachelors:](https://www.wes.org/ca/evaluations-and-fees/eca/) 220 CAD, or INR 13330.90, so around 13.5k INR  4. [IELTS General Test](https://www.britishcouncil.in/exam/ielts/dates-fees-locations) INR 14,700  5. [India PCC Application](https://www.passportindia.gov.in/AppOnlineProject/fee/feeInput): You'd need to get this done at some point towards the middle of the process. Costs INR 500  6. [PR Medical Expenses](https://www.lilavatihospital.com/Visa-Investigation): Costs associated with doing your medicals for the PR process towards the end of the process itself. Typically costs around  5,000 - 9,000 INR. I got mine done at Lilavati back in 2016, and it was around 7,000 INR.   Those are what I'd call 'The big 6' costs, of which the 'Proof of Funds' isn't even really a cost at all; they're literally showing your savings that you intend to use when you land in Canada. You only need to show you have this and that it's not with any strings attached and you're in the clear.   ***So, with the five real costs outlined, you're looking at a final total of 1,15,819.27, aka 1.15 lakh INR. So with your Proof of Funds, that's about 9.15 lakhs at a minimum.***  Now, there could be other miscellaneous items associated with this too:  a) If you lived in any country other than India (whose cost was already mentioned above) for longer than 6 months within the past 10 years before you plan to apply, you gotta produce a Police Clearance Certificate for each country. That cost can vary depending on the country but it's not terribly expensive relative to the other options outlined above.  b) Married at the point of application? Effectively double some of those expenses, because there are two of you.  c) Training material for IELTS, courier costs...this is going to depend on how you approach it.     Now, to come to specifics on this:   **/u/homosapien2014 :**   You stated 6L as your savings and 13L as your earning capacity for now, you're sitting pretty. You're already about 60% away from the target you need to hit financially.   **/u/Assasin-ed :**   You stated 50k. I wouldn't say you're in bad shape per se, you're also young and my earnings as an artist back then were similar to yours so I can relate.   Having said that, you have ways to go on that front, but again, it's not impossible. Something that nobody tells you is that your family and friends have the ability to 'gift deed' you the balance amount as a way of raising your Proof of Funds. I'm not going to comment on whether that's a possibility in your situation, but I wanted to put it out there as a valid option for you to pursue. I know someone who did that; their dad gave them 5 Lakhs as a gift deed and when he came to Canada and settled in, he earned that money back in short order and gifted it back to his father and bought them a car as a way of saying thank you. 'Nary a dry eye in the audience, etc.   Additionally, like I said before - you're young, your earning capacity can grow and you need to focus on saving. You have a runway of at least 5 years to get the above together.   **/u/corporatededmeat :**   You stated 10L (*Sirf dal kha rahe ho kya, bc?* I didn't have nearly that much in savings when I was 24, lol :D)  Good news for you too, you're already there savings-wise, savings wise but you should add some more and get to work on that work experience, seeing as you're a fresh grad.   **Now, the million-dollar question - what do you need to do to prepare?**  1. Sit down, pen and paper out timelines. Look up the pre-requisites like I mentioned above.   2. Use the first free consultations of a few migration consultants (except Y-Axis, they're *chors*) to get a sense of if you're on the right track. I did this and I found that they were useful and going to them prepared also allows you to see right through their bullshit because often they'll have their own racket going on. Had one of those nitwits tell me my WES ECA was 'wrong' so they'd need to order a fresh one for me. He can suck it, I made it through just fine so he was full of shit and wanted to pocket some extra money because he quoted double what the WES site was actually charging.   3. For things you're not certain about, go [here](https://www.canadavisa.com/canada-immigration-discussion-board/) - This is the one source of truth for anything you need to know about Canadian immigration, for example. There will likely be similar communities on Facebook or the internet for the chosen country you want to go to.   4. Set up goals - set up a financial account for immigration money, send your savings there, take stock of how much you've reached for Proof of Funds and for the big 6 expenses. Keep a regular track of this and keep an ear to the rails if something changes so you can modify the plan accordingly. Similar, set milestone dates for when you should start work on getting some stuff done - I can tell you right now that getting the WES is a painful experience because it depends on your university giving a specific document and either mailing directly to them (you know what grade A *chutiyas* Indian colleges are so good luck lol) or giving you a sealed, stamped envelop with the transcripts that you mail to WES for approval.   5. Start digitizing your documents, like... ALL your documents. From your birth certificate to your passport, start scanning and saving two versions of it. A high quality, high file size 'Original Master' and a compressed low-quality version. You'll need to refer to this a lot when you apply. Pay stubs, income tax filing, bank statements, everything. Download and store everything, set up reminders to download this stuff online or go into your bank branch and have them give you everything signed and stamped for your accounts and keep it. You're going to be likely printing out enough paperwork for the application to massacre a small forest, so best be prepared for it ahead of time.",india,t5_2qh1q,/r/india/comments/nezsm0/emigrate_used_to_be_a_meme_on_rindia_i_cannot/gylvdxv/
