20,20,0,1640727773,"From my understanding a lot of it is to do with tests are managed (I’m no expert, this is just my understanding of the differences in Covid testing strategies between Denmark and the UK, from having followed both countries throughout the pandemic).  In Denmark, in order to get your Covid passport to be allowed in to public places such as restaurants, cinemas etc, you have to have taken a PCR or LFD test at a test centre within 48 hours before, rather than from having done and registered your own LFD test at home (or you have to be fully vaccinated). This clamp down on testing for the virus means that Denmark has, for the most part, a pretty accurate picture of the true prevalence of Covid in the country.  In comparison, in the UK, you can get your Covid passport for entering public places by doing an LFD test at home, without it being verified by a testing facility. This makes it more likely that some tests may be done incorrectly, and also allows people to falsify a negative result. Also, a lot of the people who test positive from at-home LFD tests take isolation requirements in to their own hands and do not then take a follow on PCR test. This means that the test and trace service are not aware of the positive case, and are not able to undertaking tracing of contacts etc. Further to this, testing requirements are generally also less stringent in the UK for entering public places, workplaces etc. These things collectively mean that the NHS test and trace service, as well as the government have a less accurately view of the actual prevalence of Covid in the UK. As such, actual daily positive case numbers are predicted to being far higher than actual reported daily figures.  Worth noting that both Denmark and the UK are amongst the best countries that proactively test for different variants as well, which goes a long way towards understanding what variants are where.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/rqlk9l/covid_live_england_recorded_highest_number_of/hqbv5gi/

Being told by your employer you have to have a medical procedure or you're fired is being compelled. It clearly violates the most basic of human and worker rights. Those being bodily integrity and medical privacy, respectively.  &gt;How the F does that have any relevance or bearing on anything?!?  Ask the tens of thousands of NHS staff unhappy with being compelled to have COVID vaccines. It's a lot easier to exploit a minority of people than it is a majority.   &gt;Why the hell should everyone be forced to expose their elderly relatives to some ignorant anti-vax moron who puts their lives at risk, when there's no need?  Correct, there is no need. Daily testing already happens. Which, as COVID passport advocates have already acknowledged, offers the same protection as a vaccine mandate. That's why they give the choice of proof of vaccine or a negative test result (a far less recent one).  Your fear doesn't give you the right to mandate medical procedures for other people. I don't know how else to put it. Particularly when the people demanding this aren't doing the most basic things to protect themselves from COVID. If you're this afraid of COVID, I can recommend a dozen things you can do to mitigate your risk. But you'll do none of them because you're a raging hypocrite who wants to stamp on other peoples' rights to protect you from your own irresponsibility.   &gt;Yes. Really. Go ask a lawyer.

34,34,0,1639566489,"&gt;Why against covid certification?  I'm against them first and foremostly because they have been proven, by [studies](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/229153/vaccine-passports-linked-covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy/), to *increase* vaccine hesitancy.   COVID-19 vaccines have little (and decreasing) ability to protect against transmission of the virus, but they are able to prevent severe disease and even death. It's extremely important that people get vaccinated, but COVID passports entrench the unvaccinated and may even turn people against getting their boosters. They create a sense that vaccines are being used to control people rather than help them. And even worse - the conduit for the backlash caused by that perception is usually the National Health Service. That, to my mind, is more dangerous than just letting an unvaccinated person into an establishment to spread the virus - something that, whether they're vaccinated or not, would be happening anyway.  [The Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Select Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Administration_and_Constitutional_Affairs_Select_Committee) also published [a report](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/327/public-administration-and-constitutional-affairs-committee/news/157355/covid-passport-policy-lacks-scientific-evidence-base/) in September 2021 noting that COVID passport policies ack a scientific evidence base. And since then, real world application in similar countries to England like Wales, Scotland, and France have shown that they have little to no effect on viral spread. France has possibly the strictest COVID passport policy in the world and yet they have similar daily case numbers to the UK right now and are in the midst of their second biggest wave - England is in the same position, and we have not had COVID passports until now.  On a personal note: my mum's family are Irish Catholics from Northern Ireland. I have an extreme aversion to segregation. Barring the unvaccinated from participating in society, [especially when so many of them are of an ethnic minority makeup](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(21)00157-5/fulltext), is a bit dodgy to me.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/rgn50a/jeremy_corbyn_votes_against_compulsory_jab_for/homqp79/

I’m saying on this particular issue I.e. you must undergo this medical procedure or your individual freedom to go the cinema, go to concerts, go to football games etc is revoked, is unjust. As we have said, the unvaccinated pose little to no more of a risk than the vaccinated in terms of transmission, so on what grounds do the government have the right to control people in this way?   It’s easy to compare it to needing a driving license to drive, for example, as many have, but it is very clear why someone without a driving license poses a danger to other road users or pedestrians; they either haven’t been or couldn’t be trained to a suitable standard, or they have previously driven to such a poor and unsafe degree that their license has been revoked. It is pretty black and white. Even then, all the government is saying is “You require a license to do X, otherwise you can’t do X”. Covid passports straight away rest on far more unsteady ground in terms of their justification.

40,40,1,1639507254,"As per a report that the cross-party parliamentary Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee published in September...  &gt;Covid passports are being introduced for entry to some venues, including nightclubs and live sporting events, to control the spread of the virus according to the Government. However, new analysis and a lack of evidence provided by the Government in its response to the Committee’s report casts doubt on whether this will work.   &gt;   &gt;\[...\] the latest analysis by Public Health England (PHE) found that although being fully vaccinated protects against infection and severe symptoms, it unlikely to do much to stop the spread of the virus if people become infected. Jabbed and unjabbed individuals carry similar amounts of the virus.   &gt;   &gt;Concerns over viral load of the Delta variant appeared in Sage meeting minutes from 22 July. Sage, the Government’s scientific advisory panel, warned that there is ‘limited vaccine effect against onward transmission’ of the variant. Given that this meeting was held before the Government responded to the Committee’s report, the Committee has severe concerns about the way in which this policy has been developed and kept under consideration.  “We have often heard throughout the pandemic that the Government will follow the science, but when afforded the opportunity to provide it on Covid passports, it has failed to do so. All we have is a flimsy claim that there is a public health case, but without any foundation for the claim to stand on.”  “With recent analysis suggesting that vaccinated people carry as much of the virus as the unvaccinated into any setting, the disappointing lack of any scientific basis for the Government’s decision to go ahead could reasonably lead people to conclude that there is in fact no such basis. If the real goal is to drive vaccine uptake, then it is a deeply cynical approach that will be counterproductive.”  “Following through on such a costly, discriminatory and, potentially, ineffective policy will have consequences for trust in and acceptance of the Government’s measures to tackle the pandemic. It’s surely either time to prove how this’ll work or to put an end to it.”  Or let's just take a look at France, who have a similarly sized population as the UK *and* an incredibly strict COVID passport programme, and currently have a 7 day case average of +48,000 - not dissimilar to the UK's +51,000 7 day case average.  They do not fucking work, and the Wikipedia article you linked is talking about quarantine certificates, not COVID passports.  &gt;the public health measures being mandated are neither oppressive nor authoritarian  I'm sure the people present at Sarah Everard's wake, the Kill The Bill protestors who got their faces fucking smashed in with riot shields because they were 'violating COVID-19 restrictions', the university students who had the police pin them into their accommodation blocks, etc. would agree with you.  You can harp on about how I'm on the wrong side of history if you want. We'll see what happens when the unvaccinated, who already map directly onto a map of people who hate authority, get to position medical agencies as an 'other' to fight because they're being threatened with social exclusion to get vaccines they don't trust, by a government they don't trust and don't believe are acting in their best interests, every six months.  &gt;Facts.   &gt;   &gt;Don't.   &gt;   &gt;Care.   &gt;   &gt;About.   &gt;   &gt;Your.   &gt;   &gt;Feelings.

Uh... look i think that guy is a prat, and I agree that the measures being proposed are good and necessary (and not going far enough: a lockdown would probably bankrupt me and is probably necessary) however there is a legitimate fear that these measures, created in a time of national emergency, might get extended or simply not leave at the end.

110,110,0,1632468179,"#BBC’s lack of Tory scrutiny is ‘failing’ viewers, research finds   *Laura Webster*  ---   THE BBC has been accused of “failing to deliver” on its editorial guidelines after it emerged that its flagship News at Six did not run a single negative news story about the UK Government last week.  From September 13-17 no stories on the UK-wide news programme featured negative framing of the Westminster Government, research by The National found.  During the same period, Reporting Scotland ran 10 stories about the Scottish Government with a negative framing.  The disparity was identified as political stories on both the News at Six and Reporting Scotland were recorded each evening and categorised based on whether they featured a positive, negative or neutral framing of each government. Negative framing typically includes someone being “accused” of something or forced to “defend” an action.   The News at Six mainly featured stories that were neutral towards the UK Government, with 17 of the total 24 political stories using this framing. There was also one positively framed story about the UK Government, one neutral package about the Scottish Government and one negatively framed segment on Holyrood.  Meanwhile Reporting Scotland featured just six neutrally framed stories about the SNP government, compared to 10 negative ones. Every UK Government story was framed in a neutral light, and there was just one positive Scottish Government piece.  It is the third time this year The National has carried out the research, and the third time Reporting Scotland has been noticeably more critical of Holyrood than the News at Six has been of Westminster.  Rona Mackay (below), SNP MSP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, criticised the BBC over the findings.  “The BBC is mandated to ‘due impartiality in all its output’ – but they are failing to deliver on their own editorial guidelines,” she told The National.  “It is hard to believe Reporting Scotland and its sensationalist reporting are from the same organisation as the too-often acquiescent BBC News at Six.  “BBC bosses needs to explain to audiences the gross disparity in their editorial treatment between north and south of the Border.”  Most stories with a negative framing of the Scottish Government focused on health last week, with stories covering high ambulance response times, increased Covid-19 deaths, hospitality groups’ criticism of vaccine passport plans and a technical issue preventing full reporting of daily coronavirus figures.  Health stories on the News at Six, however, were presented to viewers through a neutral lens despite touching on similar themes of Covid-19 and planning to see the NHS through a difficult winter.  The 17 neutral stories also included coverage of the Westminster debate on cutting Universal Credit, a move which could push 800,000 people into poverty, according to research from the Legatum Institute think tank.  A spokesperson for the BBC said: “Journalists across the BBC always strive for fairness, accuracy and impartiality in their reporting of news stories for our audiences across all our platforms.”  The new research has been revealed after the Scottish Government hit back at Scottish Tory claims that ministers had put up a “wall of silence” over problems facing the NHS and ambulance service.  At the weekend, BBC Scotland interviewed Tory MSP and GP Sandesh Gulhane – with presenter Martin Geissler saying Humza Yousaf and Jason Leitch had refused to appear on the Sunday Show.  A spokesperson for the Holyrood Government said the Conservatives’ claims were “false”.  “Government and ministers have been working around the clock and will continue doing so to keep the public informed and to support the NHS through the exceptional and unique pressures it is facing due to the global pandemic,” they said.  “Ministers and clinicians have spoken to the media almost every day last week – the Health Secretary was interviewed on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and today [Sunday], the First Minister addressed Parliament on Thursday and the national clinical director was interviewed on Thursday and Friday.”",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/puepr3/bbcs_lack_of_tory_scrutiny_is_failing_viewers/he2cp4g/

113,113,2,1631898798,"You don't seem to be getting the point. The passport is not made to prevent vaccinated people to get covid. It is made to prevent unvaccinated people from accessing large venues with other loads of people who can easily give them covid. Testing is an imperfect choice to accommodate those who can't get vaxxed, but at least you would know that anybody in a nightclub/large event is either vaccinated (1/2 to 1/5 of transmission probability wrt to unvaccinated, so lower probability of having covid overall) or tested negative. This would reduce spread to unvaccinated people and create more incentives to get vaccinated.  In turn, this would reduce the hospital burden. Which is the main and only point of the initiative.   Your considerations on the current passport make no sense, as it is not in widespread use. Also, the domestic pass does not show why you have it. It just shows you are ""ok"". So you are not sharing personal data (if you are vaccinated or not). You clearly don't know how they work.  The only legitimate reason against this initiative is ""I don't want a sort-of ID thing"". Let's not consider that you already have to present it to enter nightclubs, but it is legitimate. I would not agree, but it is legitimate.

114,114,3,1631902187,"&gt;It doesn’t create an incentive, it effectively mandates it if you need one to do anything to be involved with society  No, it doesn't. You can still test or avoid going to places. A mandate means that if you are not vaccinated, you get fined heavily if you don't vaccinate your children your parental rule can be overridden by public health officials, and so on.  For example, passports are not mandatory. However, if you don't have one you can't go to places. Blood tests are not mandatory, nor are condoms, but if you don't test and you have unprotected sex you can't donate blood. And so on. Vaccination won't be mandatory, but if you don't get vaccinated nor want to test with the free LFTs... well, you won't be able to go to places. Easy.  &gt;Like I’ve said, why do you need a passport if the majority of the population is vaccinated?  The ""majority"" of the population is vaccinated also in the US. However, you can see how several states are saturating their hospitals despite it being summer (so people spending more time outdoor). Is the 89% in the UK enough to prevent hospitals from getting full? In case of a strong wave, even without a new variation probably not. Full hospitals mean postponing other types of healthcare, putting other hospital patients at risk etc...  &gt;I work with complex data on a daily basis  Me too. So you should know that one of the things that can make such a system acceptable is a simple rule of not storing the data and not showing the reason of your pass. People will know you have the passport, but not why. It could be due to testing or vaccination. Or exemption. Or whatever other reason. You won't be able to tell novaxxers from vaxxed people, exempt from vaxxed, and exempt from novaxxers. The only thing you will get to know is that that person is either vaccinated or does not have covid, and thus is allowed to enter a venue (if they had covid and knew it, they should be barred anyway as by law).  &gt;The point you are missing is if this allowed to happen en-masse and becomes the norm, they will be able to mandate anything. Personal freedom and choice is something we should never ever ever take for granted because once it’s gone, it’s seriously fucking hard to get back.  Again, this is a legitimate argument. I may agree for the UK more than for other countries (due to the common law system and lack of a proper Constitution), but the other arguments do not make any sense. I have told you what is the point of passports (avoid clogging up hospitals), that they already exist and are based on a fully functional system (no need to spend money, just open your NHS app and you'll find your pass), and that this does not reveal any information regarding your health record (you have clearly never opened your NHS domestic covid pass, have't you?), nor your ""checks"" get stored.  Even the legitimate concern that mandatory vaccines may reduce uptake may be true under certain circumstances, but not in general. For example, a mandatory covid vaccine may reduce public confidence in the institutions for the future, but I would expect the covid vaccination rate to go up, and fast. It happened in France and Italy. Again, Italy recently had to introduce harsh vaccine mandates and strengthen their enforcement as a lot of people just stopped vaccinating their children against deadly diseases due to fake news and social media resonance chambers, with vaccination rates for some of the ""normal"" vaccines dropping to 85-90%. After the mandate was introduced a few years ago, vaccination rates are up a gain to close to 100%.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ppyd78/bbc_news_covid_vaccine_and_test_passes_to_be/hd8hmos/
115,115,4,1631905772,"Currently, I agree with you on the mandated, it isn’t. However, my concern is that it isn’t financial consequences, it’s the discrimination and societal pressures that have consequences on people. Purely anecdotal, but my brother has PTSD and for that reason couldn’t wear a mask, it triggered him and he was regularly met with abuse because he wasn’t wearing a mask in a public setting. It’s these people I’m trying to defend and introducing measures like vaccine passports has wide reaching consequences that I just don’t think you are willing to even entertain or admit they are real.  I could probably align with you if the vaccine stopped all transmission and was a silver bullet to stop covid altogether - but it isn’t. We are told almost every winter the NHS is due to collapse due to the flu (again, I’m not an idiot, covid is more serious than the flu, but the main point stands, we don’t require a passport for other transmissible diseases which supposedly bring the NHS to its knees every winter) so why would give up liberties for this? Why would we prevent people from being active members of a society? If someone is clinically unable to have a vaccine, no amount of testing or passports is going to protect them, thus making the entire idea useless, the only use would be handing over control to the government for artificial purposes.  Travel passports are completely different. I do not need one domestically to enter a pub or a venue, unless it’s being used for ID purposes in place of a driving license or any other officially recognised ID, which is a completely different context to the one in which you referred to.  Abstracting data away or down to a yes or no or other simplified context does not decrease the sensitivity of the data when used in a personal context, that’s why we have things like password fields on login forms, the data is abstracted from view, but is still sensitive. Vaccination data or health data in general is sensitive, which is why we have super strict laws to keep it that way. The idea of having a passport doesn’t work in practise also. Who decides the validity of the passport? What system does it get checked against? A centralised government database? Government systems are generally shite and outdated and couldn’t cope with a nationalised rollout on such scale and demand. What would the infrastructure look like to enable this? Every single enclosed space in the country would need some kind of validation system to make sure it was all correct or the effectiveness of the passport system is essentially non-existent. It’s all good showing a phone screen or piece of paper but can it actually be verified? In this case the data you refer to has absolutely no integrity, therefore making it absolutely useless to do anything with. I have opened the app tbh, it’d be incredibly easy to take a screenshot and doctor it, hence the need for validation infrastructure, which I wouldn’t trust our government to implement in a month of Sunday’s given how poorly designed and poorly engineered the test and trace app was.  The whole point of the vaccine is to stop clogging up hospitals, if a tiny proportion of the population (I think your over exaggerating how many people are genuine anti-vaxxers) don’t get vaccinated it will be negligible on terms of the overall outcome, especially considering that people who have the vaccine can also still be hospitalised, again the vaccine does not eliminate covid.  The UK government are renowned for the “surveillance state”, this is no untruth. If you work with data like you say, you will understand how much the government are hell bent in knowing where we are, who we’re with and so on. This concern that “giving an inch and they will take a mile” is not unfounded, if we let me mandate things like this, it’ll be a hell of a lot easier to mandate more intrusive things in the future. I can almost say with certainty that most of the powers granted to the government in the COVID Act as temporary measures will remain in law.  So better education and combating fake news seems like a better alternative to increase uptake in any vaccine, as most experts do agree.   A vaccine passport is not necessary at all, if people are vaccinated, which the majority are, the risk in the NHS collapsing is reduced by an order of magnitude. It’s widely impractical in my opinion and I’m a strong advocate for peoples privacy, personal data, personal responsibility and personal choice. I also don’t believe everyone who opts out of having the vaccine is a raging lunatic that succumbed to fake news, it’s just simply their choice and they shouldn’t be excluded from society, they should still have the same rights as anyone else.  I don’t think we’ll agree and that is completely fine, we don’t have to agree that’s beauty of personal freedom!

180,180,3,1630264963,"&gt;The data simply does not support this belief.   Yep, vaccine acceptance is pretty high, but there's nothing wrong with aiming to have higher acceptance than 88%. Every extra person who uses the relatively small resources to get vaccinated reduces strain on our health system. And since you like anecdotes so much, I suggest you look at some of the comments from medical professionals on here about their feelings on this. Or here's a wider survey if you don't want to listen to random people on the internet https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/226513/many-icu-staff-have-experienced-mental/  &gt; but it would be far cheaper and easier to offer a £100 payment to each fully vaccinated young adult   Yeah, I'm not against that idea. Sounds fine to me. But I see no issue with having it alongside vaccine passports.  &gt;**3) Vaccine passports ignore natural immunity due to prior infection**  &gt;There is now a good body of evidence showing that recovery from prior infection offers strong protection against re-infection. Freaking out about 34% of young adults being unvaccinated ignores the fact that a substantial portion of them will already have protection (90% of 30-year-olds were found to already have antibodies against Covid). If there truly is a concern about unvaccinated young people,   &gt; surely the problem will solve itself quickly as they get infected by and recover from Covid.   People don't just 'recover from covid'. They put an entirely unnecessary burden on our healthcare system. It seems you have very little empathy for the people working hard to save idiots who don't give a damn about others.  &gt;  by now everyone choosing to remain unvaccinated is willingly taking that risk.  There are plenty of people who are simply apathetic to it. The portion of diehard antivaxxers is quite small.   https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1138  Plenty of people are open to putting in the effort to get one.  &gt;The argument that the unvaccinated pose a threat to the vaccinated does not stack up. While vaccines offer strong protection against serious illness or death from Covid, the most recent data emerging from highly vaccinated countries (such as Israel or Gibraltar) shows that vaccines are less effective at preventing infection.  Which studies are you referring to? Because from what I can see, the evidence is quite clear that vaccines reduce the spread of infection  https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n338  &gt;Once pubs and other venues are forced to implement a mechanism for checking everyone’s vaccine passports on entry,  Who said pubs should be forced to do this? I've never argued that.  &gt; it will become trivially easy to expand the system to advance other social objectives, and transform Britain into a “papers, please” society.   Well, I agree that pubs shouldn't be forced to do this, but I don't think it would be any worse than requiring pubs to stop smoking indoors, or telling people to wear seatbelts in their own car. What a lot of people don't seem to understand is that we have a social healthcare system. It costs people resources to look after others who harm themselves unnecessarily.  &gt; What about banning criminals and other social undesirables? Once it’s normal for pubs, why not roll it out to all public venues?  That's nonsense. The point of our justice system is rehabilitation. Criminals are not 'social undesirables', assuming that our justice system is working remotely well.  &gt; Not because I'm against flu jabs, but because I have never needed one.   Getting a flu jab isn't just for you. You seem to be one of those people who doesn't really grasp that vaccines are not just for the person receiving them. Some nice info from the CDC here:  https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/misconceptions.htm  &gt;The sad thing is that you *talk* like a government official even though you aren't one.   Indeed I am not. I am quite critical of this government and think it's one of the worst the UK has seen in a century. My stance on this issue is the same regardless of what the government holds as a stance.

183,183,0,1630004729,"&gt; However, I feel that those who want them should be the ones to convince everyone else why they are a good idea, why they would benefit everyone.  Simply put, if a vaccine means that someone has less chance of transmitting a potentially fatal virus, it is of interest to people whether someone they are in contact with is vaccinated. Vaccine passports are merely official documentation for that.  You seem to be persisting with the strawman that somehow vaccine passports do not account for people who cannot receive a vaccine, yet of course, they do. The few situations where they have been rolled out recently also account for people who haven't had the vaccine, but have actually been ill with the virus.  &gt; at the moment the majority of people who will have a vaccine have probably already had one by now.  Some people take more convincing than others. This is quite natural, and we shouldn't give up at the first sign of difficulty.  &gt; The people who you now have to convince are those conspiracy theorists and those who are reluctant to for whatever reason.  Fortunately not. There are still plenty of people who are simply uninformed or apathetic, I know some of them in person.  &gt; Punishing them into getting a vaccine, by restricting their freedoms   You're back on the strawman arguments - where did anyone say a vaccine passport is restricting freedoms? If you mean that certain situations will limit access based upon vaccination status, isn't that entirely reasonable? For example, working at a care home? It's entirely standard to limit access to certain elements of society well before covid was a thing. You need a pilots license to fly a plane for example, but are you complaining that other people's freedoms have been restricted? Some people would certainly make that argument, but I dare say it's a pretty bad one.   The reason we don't let just anyone fly planes is that it can cause damage to other people - it's the same with someone wanting to be unvaccinated. They're perfectly entitled to remain unvaccinated, but they won't have access to situations where they can harm others through their decision.  I suppose you will also argue that it's unreasonable to have laws restricting guns and knives in the UK? This is very much an argument in some countries. Fortunately, the 'muh freedoms' argument doesn't tend to go very far in the UK, perhaps because we are simply a lot more cramped together.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/pa12mw/antivaxx_protesters_force_their_way_into_itns/hagkxbi/
184,184,0,1629759475,"Why does it make so much difference? You're saying that if the vaccines provided 100% immunity from getting covid in the future, there would be no protests?  Do you believe there would be no marches, no anti vaxx rallies, none of this if that was the case? No one would be saying they dont want the government telling them what they put in their bodies if it was guaranteed that they wouldnt get covid?  They've been protesting 5g microchips in vaccines, would that no longer matter if the vaccine was 100% immunity? It doesnt add up. It is not a sound argument on that basis alone.  And all this fuss over a document surely cannot be about the small chance you can get ill after being vaccinated.   You're saying that's it's a bingo that the argument is over compliance, when again we do that without thinking all through our lives. I just had to comply with the voting register in my town. Why be so exhorcised over this one document if not for selfish reasons, and literally no other required documents? Why not protest driving licenses if it's only about agreeing to do what the government wants?  You have a personal choice to get a driving license or not, you can even still drive without one. you just cant legally drive without one.   Again there is no logic, no good reason beyond selfishness.   It comes down to a simple question. Say you want to go into building A, and they ask for a vaccine passport, and you say you dont have one, and they ask why, what's the answer?  It can be ""personal choice"", but then you cant be critical of people refusing you based on their choice.  Why choose not to have it, because you dont want a form.

Blind fear over a virus with a 99% survival rate (for almost everyone) isn't going to convince me to take a vaccine made hastily and under dubious circumstances by entities with a long criminal record.  &gt; Say you want to go into building A, and they ask for a vaccine passport, and you say you dont have one, and they ask why, what's the answer?

He called the proceedings ""preposterous"" and ""disgusting"".  &gt; His supporters filled the courtroom, with one woman repeatedly laughing and another clapping loudly when Glynn slammed Singapore's judiciary. Court officers stepped in to stop them at various points.  &gt; Thursday was meant to be Glynn's first day of trial, but he insisted he would not be pleading guilty or not guilty as it was ""nonsense"".  &gt; The hearing opened with Glynn trying to introduce his legal counsel, a Mr Abdul Rashid Abdul Rahman. He had appeared in court with Glynn previously, but was stopped at the door for improper attire.  &gt; Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh told the court that the prosecution had performed their checks and confirmed that Mr Abdul Rashid was not an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore.  &gt; Mr Abdul Rashid said he is not, but that he is an ""ambassador at large and advocate of Kingdom Filipina Hacienda"", and that he was there to defend his ""sovereign compatriot"".  &gt; He said he understood the meaning of the bar, but said ""I don't need a licence to practice"".  &gt; Mr Koh told the court that the prosecution would be making an application for Glynn to be assessed at IMH, to see if he is of unsound mind.  &gt; **FAMILY AND FRIENDS SENT LETTER ON GLYNN'S BEHAVIOUR**  &gt; ""Prosecution has received a letter from the accused's family and friends or persons purporting to be his family and friends and in this letter, the persons report a marked change of behaviour in the accused's person that was noticeable especially after the COVID restrictions set in,"" he said.  &gt; Given this new information, as well as Glynn's behaviour in court and previous hearings and his choice of counsel, the prosecution said it would be ""prudent"" to assess Glynn to ensure he is of sound mind and capable of making his defence.  &gt; Glynn interrupted at multiple points. He told District Judge Eddy Tham: ""I assure you my mind is very sound. Every time I ask you hard questions, you can't answer me, you shoot me down. What law have I broken? I asked you three times the last time, you gave me silence, silence, silence.""  &gt; He added that he was ""wide awake"", ""enlightened"" and researched ""everything"" but believes nothing.  &gt; When Mr Koh added that Glynn's family members have reported his ""increasing hostility"" towards them, Glynn interjected: ""The certificate of vaccine regulations do not apply to the living man and I'm well aware of this fact.""  &gt; ""Why have the mask regulations been dropped all over American and Europe? Because they are unconstitutional. I don't get my information from the Straits Times.""  &gt; He asked if the prosecutor had seen his ""sovereign ID"", adding that he felt like ""a PhD law lecturer dealing with a GCE law student"".  &gt; He claimed that the police ""kidnapped and abducted"" him on his daughter's birthday, arresting him a second time at his hotel.  &gt; ""I hid in the bathroom and I said - I do not consent, I do not comply. They dragged me out of the shower and handcuffed me. I asked them what crime am I accused of committing. Silence,"" Glynn continued.  &gt; He claimed he spent 18 days ""being tortured in Changi Prison"".  &gt; ""What kind of justice is this, this is preposterous, and the torts against either living man that have been done against me include two unlawful arrests, two false imprisonments, two trespasses against me. They've stolen my passport, my God-given right to travel,"" he said.  &gt; He added that he understood the law ""better than anyone you've ever dealt with before"" and demanded to be released and sent back to England with his family, ""and let's not have a big fuss and scene over this"".  &gt; He continued that his defence is ""very solid and water-tight"" and that the prosecutor ""has no control over my legal fiction"".  &gt; ""I will never plead guilty or not guilty. I can't believe this has been going on since the 8th of May,"" Glynn said.  &gt; ""It's so straightforward it's so clear that this sham of a case should be dropped.""  &gt; A woman in the public gallery burst out laughing soon after this, and another woman waved two thumbs up at Glynn.  &gt; Judge Tham ordered Glynn to be remanded at IMH for two weeks and return to court on Aug 19.  &gt; At this, Glynn raised his voice, saying this is ""absolutely outrageous injustice"".  &gt; ""I am disgusted. How can you send an innocent man to prison when he has not been found guilty and the charges do not apply to him ... I am disgusted at how the Singapore judicial system has treated me and my family,"" he said.  &gt; The woman who had raised her thumbs at Glynn clapped very loudly at this point, and the judge reminded her to observe court decorum.  &gt; As proceedings wound down, Glynn called to the prosecutor: ""Good luck getting into the book of life, Mr Koh. Good luck with that one. How can you say Singapore is a safe country. Police who hunt me down like a pack of wild animals. This is not justice. This is disgusting. I am appalled.""  &gt; He added that he would be ""seeking lawful remedy"".  &gt; Glynn will be taken back to court in two weeks.

If that makes me an anti-vaxxer then so are you. I'll happily get the Covid vaccine once we have long-term safety data. At which point I will ***still*** be against vaccine passports. Just like the majority of people I know who are against vaccine passports ***have had the vaccine***.  What is your approach to defending vaccine passports against these people who have the exact same concerns over them?  &gt;The vaccine is neither experimental  [It's being studied until 2023](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04368728?term=NCT04368728&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1). Like I say, I'll wait until that's finished and we have actual long term safety data to go on.   &gt;nor unlicensed  [It has been authorised for emergency use. Not licenced in the same way a vaccine which has undergone long-term studies has.](https://www.pfizer.com/science/coronavirus/vaccine/about-our-landmark-trial)  I am not against the vaccine. It is great that it is working and that uptake is so good. I'm just not risking my health for it. I've already had covid. The IFR and symptomatic presentation of covid drops hugely amongst the vaccinated (IFR will be sub-0.5%) so the risk of anyone catching serious disease from me is miniscule.  So what are the benefits of vaccine passports amongst a largely vaccinated population? How do they outweigh the economic and social downsides of excluding 5-10% of the population from society? What is cost benefit? The government has a track record of screwing things up, this will be no difference. All for a virus with an IFR of sub-0.5%.  The true reasons for bringing in a vaccine passport would be authoritarian and sinister, they are in no way justified in terms of the virus.

204,204,2,1627238514,"&gt;Is the vaccine working exactly as anticipated? There are fairly hefty side effects, one of the reasons other mRNA experiments have never got past primary testing. I won't muddy the waters with anecdotal evidence as we both know it's not really admissable in this sort of discussion, but recorded side effects are, and they are not to be ignored (pleurisy, myocarditis, etc etc).  Now I can see you're arguing in bad faith, because the side effect profile of hese vaccines is extremely low. Far lower than the vast, vast majority of medicines out there. People get irrationally hung up on vaccine side effects.  &gt;As I say, I'm far from an anti-vaxxer, I'm a veritable pin cushion from growing up in the West and then travelling around the world. In fact, I may be rare in this discussion in that I already have a vaccine passport: for yellow fever, a disease with a death rate of between 15 and 50%. Even the lowest end of that is 5x more deadly than the most extreme (3-4%, age adjusted, CDC) estimates of covid. And even then you don't show it in fucking shops, if anywhere you show it at the border.  The deadliness of a disease is NOT the only factor. The rate of spread is very important. Long term post viral syndromes are very important. Covid spreads much more rapidly than yellow fever. Comparing them is absolutely absurd.   Countries with yellow fever likely have rather high vaccine uptake rates as well.  &gt;I know living in a society requires you to surrender freedoms for the sake of other people in the society. So why is the speed limit on roads not a blanket 10 mph? I bet that would reduce car accident fatalities to essentially zero. Because there has to be some kind of compromise and I don't think that the risk of covid justifies the government overreach in this case.  Absurd comparison. Not nearly enough people are injured/dying on the roads to overburden the ambulance services, or fill hospitals to dangerously high occupancy levels. Traffic injuries are not contagious, either.

Is everyone now going to be required to have a government mandated app on their phone or carry a set of papers to supermarkets, on public transport, in schools or restaurants? What if they then start demanding boosters? What if they introduce other things in to the passport?  Slippery slope fallacy. Disregard.   &gt;I work in a special needs school that’s remained open every single day since it began, we’ve had many, many cases (due to a large amount of spitters and need for physical contact) and my partner has tested positive (had extremely close contact throughout) and as part of my job, I’ve had to do almost daily lateral flow tests and I’ve done multiple PCR tests whenever I’ve had even the slightest symptom. Guess how many times I’ve tested positive? Zero. Guess how many times I’ve spread it to my team (who I have extremely close physical contact with daily)? Zero.   Anecdote. Disregard.   &gt;And you think I should be forced to put a substance in my body, at the risk of social exclusion, when I have demonstrably not spread it nor caught it, a substance that’s worrying me about as much as a severe flu?   Hyperbole. Nobody is forcing you to do anything. If the substance is only as worrying as flu I'm not sure what your problem is, and if the virus is only as worrying as severe flu that still presents a problem to your vulnerable pupils. You have been fortunate, but don't get cocky.   &gt;When there’s reasonable measures like simply washing your fucking hands or producing a negative test  Hate to break it to you but the tests are basically crap and I wouldn't be surprised if you've actually had COVID and been asymptomatic. I've seen plenty of couples pre-vaccine who have a 'normal' relationship where one tests positive and the other doesn't despite multiple tests. There's no way in my mind that someone kissing and having sex with you hasn't caught COVID off you which led me to question the efficacy of the tests. Sure enough, the data shows something like 30% of PCR tests are falsely negative and the lateral flow tests are frankly useless.   &gt;why stop there eh, let’s head towards a Chinese social scoring system.

275,275,0,1624259645,"The Port of Dover is taking legal action to overturn an “irrational” government decision not to fund a £33.5m project to build more passport check points which it says are needed to cope with post-Brexit immigration controls.  The UK channel port, which handles more EU lorry freight than all other UK ports combined, has won the right to seek a judicial review of a Cabinet Office [decision last December](https://archive.is/aMLjK) not to grant funds for the project that would have doubled passport checking capacity.  Dover applied last September for a grant from the £200m Port Infrastructure Fund but was rejected after the fund attracted applications worth more than £450m.  Seeking leave to have the decision overturned in the courts, Dover’s lawyers said the government had “acted irrationally” and “contrary to the published criteria” of the Port Infrastructure Fund, as well behaving “procedurally unfairly”.  UK government lawyers asked the court to refuse Dover’s application, arguing that the government had “wide discretion” in deciding which applications to accept and that Dover’s application did not meet the full requirements of the fund’s rubric.   However, a High Court judge ruled Dover raised issues that were “clearly arguable” in court and granted permission for the case to be heard. Dover is seeking that the government’s original decision is quashed and their application reconsidered.  The case raises the prospect of significant disruptions to cross-Channel travel and trade when passenger numbers rise following the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. The French border police informed the port that passengers and lorry drivers will face “100 per cent immigration checks” after Brexit.  As a result of leaving the EU, British passport holders can now only spend 90 days in any 180 day period in the EU without obtaining a visa, requiring passports to receive a dated entry stamp, increasing the time needed for checks.  In its submission to the court, Dover said the UK Border Force had warned the new checks could reduce the “flow rate” through Dover’s passport lanes to “50 people per hour, per lane” — about a tenth of pre-Brexit flows of 500 per hour, per lane.  Dover currently has just five passport lanes and on a busy holiday weekend can expect up to 20,000 passenger vehicles in a day.  Under special arrangements known as “juxtaposed controls” designed to speed travel over the Channel crossing, French border and immigration checks are conducted at Dover so that passengers can disembark without stopping when they reach Calais.   A National Audit Office report [last November](https://archive.is/ERViF) estimated that new post-Brexit checks could mean passenger queues of one to two hours after January 1, but warned that in peak periods “the queues and delays could become much longer”.   Travel restrictions imposed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic have meant that the NAO’s estimates have not been tested. The lack of passenger vehicles has also helped keep freight traffic moving, with lorries currently using four of the five available lanes — compared to just one lane before Brexit.  Tim Reardon, the head of EU exit planning at Dover, said French frontier police had requested the extra booths and the UK government, according to the agreement on ‘juxtaposed controls’, was obliged to provide them.  “This project is essential to maintain the flow of freight and passenger traffic now full immigration controls are required post-Brexit.

297,297,2,1618768177,"When it comes to Europe’s Covid vaccination rollout, could it be that slow and steady wins the race?  After a lacklustre start to delivering doses around the continent, that is certainly the message European leaders are now sending.  Following a debut marred by delays and a dearth of supplies, the EU’s vaccination drive is finally gathering pace, leading some even to suggest - chief among them President Emmanuel Macron himself - that it could catch up with Britain “in the coming weeks”.  “With all the shots rolling in, it’s even no longer unthinkable that the EU will finish vaccinating its entire adult population ahead of the UK,” claimed Joshua Livestro, member of the Committee on European Integration of the Advisory Council on International Affairs of the Dutch Foreign Ministry.  ""While the UK is likely to finish its vaccination marathon crawling on all fours, the EU will be sprinting toward the tape.”  As the UK reopens, such claims appear wildly exaggerated. Indeed, with the continent still in the grip of a deadly third wave and fresh health concerns over the new Johnson&amp;Johnson jab as well as new variants, the EU is struggling to make headway against the pandemic.  Yet undoubtedly there are encouraging indicators.   European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced this week that the EU administered 100m doses, “a milestone we can be proud of!”. More than a quarter are second shots, meaning more than 27m Europeans are fully vaccinated.  “We are also accelerating the delivery of vaccinations,” she insisted.  The EC chief has set a target of inoculating 75 per cent of the adult population by the end of summer.  EU leaders have also declared that the bloc will soon become the world’s number one producer of vaccines.  With the EU’s nose still out of joint over AstraZeneca delays and its run-in with the UK, Mrs von der Leyen confirmed the bloc would receive 250m doses of Pfizer in the second quarter - some 50m more than expected. Negotiations have begun for a contract of 1.8bn doses over 2021-2023 with all production and raw materials being based on the continent.  Some countries are bounding ahead with jabs. In the Netherlands, the number of daily doses per 100 people shot above the UK rate of 0.64 to reach 0.77 on April 11. With 4m doses administered, the country has now given 21.6 per cent of the adult population a first dose, with 6.1 per cent of the population fully vaccinated.  Lampooned for its early vaccination efforts, France has passed some positive milestones of late.  It is consistently hitting more than 450,000 vaccinations a day after opening the first of 40 mass vaccine centres across the country last week, including at the stade de France, the national stadium. On Friday, it surpassed 12 million first doses - two million higher than its mid-April target - and is easily on track to reach 20 million by mid-May and 30 million the following month.  Ursula von der Leyen received her vaccine a day after the EU passed 100m jabs Ursula von der Leyen received her vaccine a day after the EU passed 100m jabs Some 17.8 per cent of the French population, (and 22.8 per cent of adults), had received one jab with more than six per cent having received two. That is still way behind the UK, which has surpassed 32 million first doses (61.4pc of the population) and eight million second jabs (15.5pc).  To speed things up, France has increased the gap between the two doses of the mRNA jabs, making the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine available to anyone over 55, and rolled out the first 200,000 doses of the Johnson &amp; Johnson product a week early - also available for this age bracket.  Not all milestones are welcome, however. France this week became the eighth country whose death toll surpassed the 100,000-mark. With an average of roughly 300 deaths a day and almost 6,000 people in intensive care - the highest figure since April last year - government spokesman Gabriel Attal warned that “the third wave is not behind us”, nor is its peak.  There are also growing fears about the possible impact of the Brazilian variant, which along with the South African mutation accounts for 4.2 per cent of French cases and prompted it to suspend flights from Brazil this week.  Given such headwinds, it is too early to say whether Mr Macron, who is up for election in 12 months time, can claim to have been right to refuse to lock the country for a third time in January, despite calls from his own scientific advisors.  Germany, where vaccine roll-out has accelerated dramatically since Easter, is in a similar race against time and its ability to get a handle on the virus could also prove key for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party.  On Wednesday, the country set a new national record with 738.501 jabs in a day, compared with 547,465 in the UK on the same day. Some 18.5 per cent of Germans have now had their first jab, compared to just 12 per cent on April 1. Some 6.4 per cent are fully vaccinated.  While bigger deliveries of vaccines have played a role, the decision to involve GPs in the jab campaign has also been key to the newfound speed.    Doctors administered more than 1.1m in their first week alone and are expected to ramp up even further as dose quantities increase. The gear change could see the entire adult population receive a first jab by July 18, two months early and be fully vaccinated by August 8, according to the German Institute for Public Health Insurance (ZI).  A shadow on the horizon is the concern the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine may cause blood clots. Germany has factored the vaccine heavily into its plans — it is expecting an order of 10m jabs — and any decision to limit its use could slow the country’s roll-out.  Meanwhile, in Italy, daily inoculations are hovering above 200,000 new doses administered per day since late last month. Some 9.7m first doses have been administered and 4.1m second ones. Officials have expressed optimism restrictions could be eased soon if the pace of immunisation continues to pick up. That may be premature. On Wednesday, Italy reported another 16,000 new cases in 24 hours and 469 more deaths.  Indeed, the persistently high infection and death rates and hospitalisations threaten to jeopardise plans to relax rules in the coming weeks as Europeans eye Britain’s lockdown exit with envy.  Keen to cajole a country under nationwide semi-confinement and a 7pm to 6am curfew, Mr Macron held talks with the French government on Thursday night on an exit roadmap and his aides hinted that he aimed to progressive reopen cafes and restaurants, along with cultural venues by mid-May. “  “We need some quick wins to raise morale,” fretted junior social economy minister Olivia Grégoire. “(Reopening) terraces is a small victory to brighten our daily lives.”  But ministers have already warned that this is still only “hypothetical”. Mr Macron will address the nation by the end of the month.  Macron has claimed the EU could catch up with Britain “in the coming weeks” With intensive care beds filling up in Germany, Angela Merkel is struggling to push a new law through parliament to take control of lockdown measures out of the hands of the country’s 16 regional governments and impose tough national restrictions for the first time, including night-time curfews for the worst-hit areas. She has already met fierce political resistance from the regions some of who want to go the other way.  As summer beckons, EU countries, including Germany, France and Italy, remain closed to tourism for now.  But some are forging ahead with holiday plans regardless.  Greece intends to open borders on 14 May for all travellers who have been vaccinated or provide a negative coronavirus test. Croatia says it is opening up those who can prove they have had a second doses at least two weeks previously.  Meanwhile, EU governments have reached a common position on plans for digital vaccination certificates, which could eventually pave the way to a vaccine passport system open to Britons hoping to travel to Europe. The EU-only plans must be agreed with MEPs before they can become law, which could be before the end of June.  Mass vaccinations are key to getting European economies back on track.  Last month, the OECD said it expected the UK economy to grow by 5.1 per cent this year and 4.7 per cent in 2022 - a significant increase on its December 2020 estimate. Its EU growth forecast was also increased to 3.9 per cent for 2021 — however, this was a much smaller uplift than elsewhere due to its slow vaccine rollout.  “Reflecting the periodic infection waves and the pace of vaccinations, the economic recovery in Europe is still halting and uneven,"" said Alfred Kammer, director of the International Monetary Fund's European department.  ""We are suggesting an extra push, and an extra effort"" to limit permanent damage to the region's productivity.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/mthmlk/whisper_it_quietly_europes_vaccination_programme/guzo4tb/

I firmly believe that it needs to be taken back under control but the issue is, to do so its going to probably mean crashing the market and implementing control over how many properties can be owned by one person. Likewise there should be a top limit on rent that is controlled, renting property doesn't really provide much to society, you're essentially just holding on to a house which could be purchased. I'm in London and some rental properties that are multi bedroom, aren't really, its just a house where you've put a bed in every room apart from the bathroom and kitchen. No party has truly committed to social housing in a way that addresses the issues with so many people renting or the affordability of housing.

330,330,0,1617477092,"Grandparents could use Covid passport app to screen birthday party guests   Government-backed app will be used by major events and could see fans sit in different parts of stadiums according to their virus status  By Christopher Hope, Chief Political Correspondent 3 April 2021 • 6:30pm  Anyone planning an event or party will be handed the ability to stop them becoming superspreading events by scanning codes on guests' phones  Grandparents will be able to scan Covid passport apps before allowing family members into their birthday parties or gatherings under plans drawn up by a company developing a coronavirus passport app for the Government.    Anyone planning an event or party, in their own home or at a hired-out venue, will be handed the ability to stop them becoming superspreading events by scanning codes on guests' phones, which will grant access if they are vaccinated, have a recent negative test or antibodies from recent infection.  The app will also be used by major events under plans that could see fans sit in different parts of sports stadiums according to their Covid status, according to Netcompany which has been handed a £3million contract to develop Covid certificates.  Office staff would only be allowed to access work places if they can show their Covid status on the app too.  Details are set out in a video of how Covid passports might work which has been posted online by the Danish business, which was hired by the Government on a 12 month contract to develop a digital Covid passport last November.  Last month Denmark appointed Netcompany to develop its coronavirus passport app, which the company said “will contribute to the reopening of society in Denmark”. Netcompany said the app could be ready next month.  Civil liberties campaigners are already sounding the alarm.  Jake Hurfurt, head of research and investigations at Big Brother Watch, said: ""Netcompany’s chilling endorsement of segregated events and biosurveillance of our family members is a warning of the road Covid passes would lead us down.  “This contract shows that ministers misled Parliament and the public, claiming for months there were no plans for Covid passes and still claiming today that no decision has been made. This contract exposes the reality that work began on Covid certificates a long time ago.  “These draconian plans for a checkpoint nation are unnecessary, unworkable and un-British. The Prime Minister should be working to prohibit domestic Covid passes, not promote them.""  The video, titled “Corona passport – how it works”, paints a number of different scenarios involving the fictitious Larssen family – Kasper, Pia and their 14 year old son Thomas.  It sets out how Kasper is vaccinated and then downloads a coronavirus “stay safe” app which contains a digital record in an encrypted QR code of his vaccination and its timing.  For children it can be used to demonstrate to authorities that they have recently tested negative for Covid-19 within the past 48 hours.  Staff can use it to demonstrate to employers that they can work safely with customers because of an up-to-date vaccination or a recent negative test.  A second “stay open” app can be downloaded and used to check that the digital coronavirus passport is valid.  It shows how airlines could access the app to check on passengers’ “corona status” before issuing a boarding card in one instance.  In another example, Netcompany tells how 'Kasper's grandma Joanne' wants to invite family and friends to celebrate her 75th birthday.  “Using the ‘stay open’ app, Grandpa Peter scans the guests before the party begins,” the video says. It adds that “in Denmark citizens need to have received vaccines A, B or C or have a negative test less than 24 hours old to join larger private events”.  Netcompany’s video also sets out how crowds could be segregated in sports stadiums, and allowed to sit together or must remain socially distanced, according to their Covid status.  Government documents seen by The Telegraph show that Netcompany won a £3million contract with “NHS Test &amp; Trace Covid-19 [Redacted] App Programme” on Nov 26 2020.  Much of the contract is redacted. However under a section marked Schedule 1: Services, it says ""the immediate engagements are related to Covid-19 certification and existing Tracing application.  “The certification application will comprise of [sic] the following functionality for ‘Day 1 Technical Release’ or the Initial Release”.  On Saturday a spokesman for Netcompany told The Telegraph: “We have no comments to make on our engagements related to Covid certification/passes.  “And [we] cannot confirm anything else than what can be found in the public available government contract.”  He added: “All scenarios and restrictions displayed in the video referred to in your email are fictitious and only serve the purpose of demonstrating examples of how Covid passes could be used in society.  “Therefore, this video does not reflect the solution defined or chosen by any government, but solely serves as imaginary examples.  “Government solutions would in general build on principles of frictionless and easy usage throughout all user interactions driven by privacy by design to maintain and build citizen trust in the reopening process.”  A Government spokesman said: “The video on Netcompany's website states that all scenarios are fictitious and not indicative of how a certification system might work in the UK.  “No final decisions have been made on how a certification system might work in practice. Any such system that we use will take into account three factors: vaccination, a negative test and natural immunity.  “The review is considering a range of issues, including the ethical, equalities, privacy, legal and operational aspects and what limits, if any, should be placed on organisations using certification.”  A Cabinet source added: “We are never going to have Covid status certification at family parties, nor have we ever considered it.  “It’s about those high risk settings like nightclubs and theatres. Netcompany are just helping with the technical architecture of a possible app.”",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/mjf2uz/grandparents_could_use_covid_passport_app_to/gt9uaxz/

My point basically comes down too.

367,8,0,1625725182,"&gt;The Scottish government has days to act to relieve “very high pressure” on healthcare, according to the chair of BMA Scotland, after a second health board flagged acute workforce pressures as a result of rising Covid cases and large numbers of staff having to self-isolate.  &gt;Lewis Morrison said the decision by Raigmore hospital – the biggest in the Highlands – to cancel all non-urgent surgery and outpatient activity after it reached capacity on Tuesday was “a weather vane rather than an isolated example”.  &gt;Morrison told BBC Radio Scotland: “Raigmore is an example of what might well happen in other places if we don’t take some action to deal with what is a very high level of pressure on healthcare, both in general practice and in hospitals, combined with rising Covid cases leading to a large number of staff having to self-isolate.”  &gt;Asked if Scotland should follow England in scrapping self-isolation for those who have been double-vaccinated, he said he would rather make the case specifically about healthcare staff: “Do we have the evidence to support fully vaccinated staff who are contacts continuing to work with some sort of change to the testing regime?”  &gt;While warning that any changes must be evidence-based, he said the situation was urgent. He said: “Within the next few days a decision needs to be made to ensure the continuity of healthcare services in areas under these kinds of pressure.”  &gt;On Wednesday morning, Scottish Labour called on ministers to intervene as it was revealed that NHS Lanarkshire was considering scaling back its elective care services and had asked the public to attend emergency departments only “as a last resort”.  &gt;In a message to NHS Lanarkshire staff, the chief executive, Heather Knox, said: “The challenges caused by pressures on our emergency departments, rising Covid numbers and workforce pressures, are causing difficulties for staff across both acute and community services.”  &gt;Data released by the World Health Organization at the weekend revealed that half of the top 10 areas in Europe with the highest rates of Covid-19 were in Scotland.  &gt;The latest figures from the National Records of Scotland, published on Wednesday, showed that last week there were 21 deaths where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, an increase from 17 last week.  &gt;Earlier on Wednesday, the education secretary, Shirley-Anne Somerville, said the Scottish government “is looking very seriously” at whether to follow England on changes to self-isolation advice for children ahead of schools returning in August.  &gt;Later on Wednesday, first minister Nicola Sturgeon told the BBC that the planned easing of Scottish restrictions on 19 July and 9 August were “not set in stone” and that it was important to chart the route out of lockdown “at a sensible pace”.  &gt;“Nothing, against a global pandemic of an infectious virus that has got more infectious and transmissible with the Delta variant, can be set in stone.  &gt;“But to set dates in stone while we still face that virus would not in my view be responsible. My job is to take hard decisions that get us as safely as possible to that end point.”  &gt;The delayed move to level zero planned for 19 July will mean the general indoor physical distancing requirement should be reduced from 2 metres to 1 metre, and the outdoor requirement to physically distance should be lifted altogether.  &gt;From 9 August, the Scottish government aims to remove remaining legal restrictions, including social distancing indoors, by which time all over-40s should have had their second vaccine for at least two weeks.  &gt;Data last week showed that the 80% of new cases were among the under-44s, with with a total of almost 2,000 football-related cases emerging from test and protect data last Wednesday.

390,31,0,1613030546,"Asked at a Downing Street press conference last night whether the government was in talks with travel companies about setting up a vaccine passport scheme, the prime minister said that once the coronavirus situation was in a “different world” then “all kinds of apps” might be used.  He was speaking after Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, said he had been in talks with Singapore and the US already about how to unlock the possibility of holidays.  “We’re looking at all sorts of things that we may wish to do in the months ahead,” Johnson said. “You’d expect us to be talking to travel firms about all kinds of options, but the top priority now is to drive forward that vaccination programme, to give . . . everybody in the country the protection they need.”  He added: “But when we’re in that different world, which I hope is as soon as possible, then all kinds of apps and all kinds of possibilities will be open.”  Shapps had earlier acknowledged that an international vaccine passport scheme was a likely reality of post-Covid travel. “Just as we have things like the yellow fever card ... I imagine that in the future there will be an international system where countries will want to know that you have been potentially vaccinated or potentially had tests taken before flying, before you come in,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.  One such system could be ready within weeks, according to airline bosses. The International Air Transport Association (Iata), which represents about 290 airlines, including British Airways, said it had had “very fruitful” conversations with the government about its own vaccination passport app, known as Travel Pass, which will be ready for use at the end of next month.  One step required before the app is ready is for the World Health Organisation to agree an international standard for what details a vaccination certificate will include. Priti Patel, the home secretary, referenced the WHO’s work yesterday when she confirmed that the UK was working with international partners on vaccine certificates. “The World Health Organisation . . . have already done a call to action to work internationally to work in the multilateral community around how they can start to look at this,” she told The Times.  “That’s an important piece of work — there’ll be other multilateral organisations working with national governments so that work is a much higher level.”",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/lhfyt0/boris_johnson_sees_covid_vaccine_passport_app_as/gmx12a2/

392,33,0,1612347964,"Michael Gove will demand today that Brussels take urgent action to relax post-Brexit trade rules between Britain and Northern Ireland because the situation is endangering the peace process.  The Cabinet Office minister is expected to tell Maros Sefcovic, his EU counterpart, that the rules do not work and that unionists oppose them.  Tension has risen in the province after the European Commission threatened last Friday to renege on elements of the withdrawal agreement. Its officials, who wanted to prevent [coronavirus vaccines](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-flow-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-from-eu-now-guaranteed-says-minister-mwptpvxhc) from being exported to the UK, backed down after an outcry.  Yesterday checks on goods arriving in Northern Irish ports from mainland Britain were suspended over [fears for the safety of port staff](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/northern-ireland-halts-post-brexit-port-checks-after-sinister-behaviour-6qv3rdzxx). Police reported an “upsurge in sinister and menacing behaviour” by loyalists. Border officials were threatened in graffiti near Larne and claimed that unknown individuals were noting down their number plates.  Gove is expected to warn Sefcovic that the vaccine row has “shifted the political dynamic” and that changes to the Northern Ireland protocol, which was designed to avoid a hard border between the province and the Republic, are needed rapidly. In particular the government wants some checks and restrictions on the export of food and agricultural goods to be permanently lifted.  Gove said that the “grace periods” afforded to traders moving goods between Britain and Northern Ireland must be extended. Speaking in the Commons, he told MPs that an extended leniency period on EU customs rules was required to ensure supermarkets and traders could continue to supply “consumers with the goods they need”.  The government is also seeking the abolition of rules that require pets crossing the Irish Sea to have a £100 animal health certificate. Gove has not ruled out invoking Article 16 of the protocol, which would allow the government to suspend elements of it if they are causing serious “economic, societal or environmental difficulties”. The EU intended to invoke the clause to prevent vaccine supplies reaching Britain via Northern Ireland.  Gove said that the vaccine row had led to broader questions about the protocol that could not be dismissed as “teething problems”. He added: “Trust has been eroded, damage has been done and urgent action is therefore needed.  “Peace, progress and strong community relations in Northern Ireland have been hard-won and in recent days we’ve seen an increase in community tension, and, as was reported last night, port staff in Belfast and Larne have been kept away from work following concerns for their safety. The EU needs to work with us at speed and with determination to resolve a series of outstanding issues with the protocol.”  However Simon Coveney, Ireland’s foreign minister, said that issues over the protocol would not be solved by cutting relationships. “I recognise that there are serious issues that need to be resolved, we need to work on that with the commission today and with leaders in Northern Ireland,” he told *Today* on Radio 4. “But this isn’t going to be solved by cutting off relationships or trying to throw away the entire protocol, without any credible proposals as to what you replace it with.”  He added: “The protocol is only a month old. It’s part of an international agreement between the UK and the EU. We all have legal obligations in terms of its implementation and so the focus now needs to be on a calm, but firm, discussion around how we make the protocol more acceptable in the context of its implementation, where there are real problems.”  Whitehall sources said that the vaccine dispute had undermined the faith of businesses, and given influence to unionist hardliners. Arlene Foster, the Northern Ireland first minister, who will take part in the meeting with Sefcovic, is under particular pressure.  A poll this week suggested that support for her Democratic Unionist Party had fallen to 19 per cent as hardline unionists defect to the Traditional Unionist Voice party.  Ministers in the power-sharing executive issued a joint statement condemning the threats. Foster described the actions against the port staff as utterly reprehensible but called for changes to the protocol, telling UTV: “The way to deal with this is through constitutional politics.”  Micheál Martin, the Irish prime minister, told RTE that he condemned the “intimidatory tactics”. He added: “It’s a very sinister and ugly development.”",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/lbkpjm/crisis_talks_with_eu_after_loyalist_threats_at/glui3ic/

It comes amid ""weird"" data showing that case rates have been lower in unvaccinated individuals than the single, double, or even triple-jabbed since Omicron became the dominant variant in Scotland.  The counterintuitive data from Public Health Scotland (PHS) contradicts previous pandemic trends which have consistently shown infection, hospitalisation and death rates to be highest among the unvaccinated.  However, one expert stressed that the patterns probably reflect factors such as Omicron initially transmitting in more affluent communities.  ""It does appear weird until you start breaking things down,"" said Professor Rowland Kao, chair of veterinary epidemiology and data science at Edinburgh University.  HeraldScotland: Infection rates have been lowest since December 18 among the unvaccinated group, in a reverse of patterns seen previously in the pandemic Infection rates have been lowest since December 18 among the unvaccinated group, in a reverse of patterns seen previously in the pandemic  According to the latest PHS report, the Covid death rate has been consistently higher since December 4 in the double-jabbed compared to the unvaccinated - but much lower in the triple-jabbed.  The report defines a Covid death as ""an individual who has tested positive by PCR for SARS-CoV-2 [the coronavirus which causes Covid] at any time point and has Covid-19 listed as an underlying or contributory cause of death on the death certificate"".  In the final week of December, the death rate was 7.06 per 100,000 among the double-jabbed compared to 4.79 per 100,000 in the unvaccinated, and 0.21 per 100,000 in the triple-vaccinated.  READ MORE: Why Omicron is pushing the NHS to the brink - even if it is milder  In the week ending January 7, the hospitalisation rate was also twice as high in the double-jabbed compared to the unvaccinated - 130 admissions per 100,000 versus 59 per 100,000 - but fell to just 15 per 100,000 in the triple-jabbed.  The admissions data does not differentiate between patients in hospital 'because of' Covid and those who tested positive while being treated for other ailments, but PHS said the high hospitalisation rate for double-vaccinated individuals is being driven by increasing admissions among over-70s who are not yet boosted and whose immunity is waning.  It added: ""In other age groups the rates remain lower for those with two doses compared to those with one dose or unvaccinated.  ""This group of individuals aged 70-plus who have had two doses of vaccine but have not yet had a booster may include some very vulnerable individuals.""  HeraldScotland: The hospitalisation was twice as high in the double-jabbed compared to the unvaccinated, but PHS said this was skewed by admissions in over-70s and was not being seen in younger age groups  The hospitalisation was twice as high in the double-jabbed compared to the unvaccinated, but PHS said this was skewed by admissions in over-70s and was not being seen in younger age groups  The number of over-70s being admitted to hospital with Covid has surged from 131 in the week ending December 14 to 370 in the week ending January 4. While uptake has been strong, around 38,500 adults over 70 in Scotland are still due boosters.  The report also shows that during the three weeks to January 7, Covid case rates were consistently lowest in the unvaccinated population.  READ MORE: Six in 10 Covid patients admitted to hospital 'because of' virus  Preliminary data for last week - which is age-standardised to adjust for the fact that younger people are more likely than older adults to be unvaccinated - shows a Covid case rate of 11 per 1000 in the unvaccinated group compared to 15 per 1000 for those who had received a booster or third dose, and 25 per 1000 for the double-vaccinated cohort.  People are defined as being triple-jabbed if they test positive for Covid more than 14 days after their booster, ruling out explanations such as people contracting the virus in crowded queues at vaccine hubs in the run up to Christmas.  HeraldScotland: Covid hospital admissions have been rising steeply in the over-70s  Covid hospital admissions have been rising steeply in the over-70s  Prof Kao said Omicron was ""evening out the playing field"" in term of infections partly due to its ability break through vaccine protection, but also because had seeded through more affluent postcodes and arrived at a time when people previously protected by working-from-home were less likely to be doing so.  He said: ""If you look at the initial spread of Omicron the deprivation relationship was inverted.  ""You were actually more at risk of being exposed to Omicron if you lived in an area of lower deprivation, and if you're more affluent you are also more likely to have been double or triple vaccinated.  ""It's not just in Scotland; a friend of mine in Wales is seeing exactly the same thing and saying 'what in the world is going on?'.  ""My suspicion is that we have this initial explosion of infections which ignores all the previous rules, and that this question of 'where did it start off?' is more important that all the other risk factors.""  HeraldScotland: Since early December, the death rate has been higher in the double-vaccinated than the unvaccinated, but this again is likely to reflect waning immunity in hospitalised and vulnerable over-70s who were not yet boosted  Since early December, the death rate has been higher in the double-vaccinated than the unvaccinated, but this again is likely to reflect waning immunity in hospitalised and vulnerable over-70s who were not yet boosted  In addition, Prof Kao said it was unclear how well immunity from multiple prior Covid infections protected against Omicron.  He said: ""We know you get more protection from three hits of any sort - that could be two doses plus infection, two doses plus a booster.  ""But we don't actually know what would happen if you got infected two or three times, and there are probably people out there who have been.  ""You have these pockets of deprived areas in particular where the virus has been circulating at a much higher rate.""  READ MORE: Around 240,000 fewer operations carried out by NHS Scotland since pandemic began  A spokeswoman for PHS said the figures could also be skewed by factors such as higher testing uptake by ""more health conscious"" vaccinated people, adding that ""these biases become more evident as more people are vaccinated and the differences between the vaccinated and unvaccinated population become systematically different"".  HeraldScotland: HeraldScotland: Cases and hospital admissions both now look to be in decline in Scotland  Cases and hospital admissions both now look to be in decline in Scotland  She added that the higher case rates in the double-vaccinated are being driven by infections among over-40s whose immunity is waning, but who have not yet taken up or become eligible for boosters.  She added: ""The vaccination status of cases, inpatients and deaths should not be used to assess vaccine effectiveness because of differences in risk, behaviour and testing in the vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.""",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/s3fvj1/what_is_going_on_covid_rates_lowest_in/hskm852/

I absolutely believe they’re taking measures that are terrifying and authoritarian and they need reining in.   I will also say that I’m very aware of the adage “never let a good crisis go to waste”. I’m aware that measures brought into place as a temporary measure may well linger after the emergency is gone.   However, we are in the middle of pandemic. Now, I’m hoping that with omnicron we’re seeing a trend towards a much milder variant that will outcompete the other variants and render Covid more of a nuisance than anything else, but until we get there we need to take measures to mitigate against deaths.   Unfortunately, during a crisis like a pandemic, personal freedoms do get suppressed because when given the freedom to choose, many people choose to be arseholes. Look at the number of people on the tube not wearing masks even though it’s mandatory. Look at the number of people refusing to get a free vaccine but happy to take the drugs being offered to them one night and go look after the elderly the next.   You draw parallels with China. I’m looking more at America where people send thoughts and prayers every time children are killed in a school shooting but will fight tooth and nail against any gun regulation on the basis of their freedoms.   Between America and China there is a balance to be struck.   If we want to protect our elderly but do not want any form of vaccine checking then the alternative is a lockdown - or keeping the vulnerable and those in contact with them confined while the rest of us go about our daily lives. Some of us seemingly young and healthy people will die, but that’s just a risk we have to take good things going back to “normal”.   Or we can take some small measures to try and keep things under control. Make people wear face masks. Make people show their vaccination certificate when going into confined spaces.   One thing I will say - if you’re concerned about us becoming like China, look to the measures we’ve taken to strip people of their citizenship and right to protest. Look at the erosion of our social security and healthcare such that we cannot afford to be out of work so will be more reluctant to strike or do anything that might offend our employers.

One of the big unspoken problems on my side of the debate is that most our scientists are elderly &amp; retired (those still in employ have a lot to lose) and speak with dry shaky voices and are rather boring. Dr Bill Gray (deceased) was great, but he was a struggle to listen to.   On your side you've got media outlets like CNN who are smart about optics; they don't put boring scientists on screen, they use fast-talking ""science educators"" who are television and radio presenters dressed in lab coats who look and sound the part.   &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  This is way, way off the original topic, but on the issue of Barack Obama's birthplace, I do NOT believe Sherriff Joe Arpaio's theory about the birth certificate; he made a couple of very stupid mistakes about how the certificates were stamped. But on other hand, still no one has ever seen Obama's original birth certificate; it's perfectly plausible that it was destroyed, but affluent families like the Obamas tend to keep items like that quite safe.   I don't think Tony Heller ever made much mention of the birth certificate. He did however publish this: [https://realclimatescience.com/2017/01/exposing-the-first-birther/](https://realclimatescience.com/2017/01/exposing-the-first-birther/)  According to Barrack Obama's literary agent, he was born in Kenya, raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.   Now that really did get me thinking ""huh???"". It's nothing conclusive, it's just really odd. Perhaps it was a PR thing and Barack Obama was happy at the time to falsely claim that he was born in Kenya to seem more cosmopolitan?   It would not matter to me personally at all if Barack Obama  was born in Kenya, but legally, Constitutionally, it is an issue.   Did gun control lead to the Jewish Holocaust? Dunno. Don't care. Certainly the Nazis were keen to disarm the people they were to rule over.   To the issue of scientific funding:  TAXES. It's all taxes.

408,49,0,1634697936,"So I'm a Brit living in Germany, who was in the UK last summer and just recently. I also visited Portugal, France, Spain and Greece in the last few months. It's just staggeringly obvious why - and it's a confluence of reasons.     1. **Arrogance** \- I travelled to the UK (after much prevarication) in early March of 2020. The virus was already in Italy and Germany closed down pretty much overnight over the space of a few days as I was leaving - the difference between outlooks in Germany and the UK was like night and day. An example: I'm in the pharmacy south-east England and women in the queue are bitching about how Italians are so dramatic and their country is so badly run, no wonder people are dying. I clapped back and told them to grow up and that I wouldn't be surprised if the UK had the worst death rate in Europe come summer. See also everyone pretending like nothing was happening. See also the whole cabinet falling ill in the space of a few days, etc, etc. See British tourists here in Berlin acting like it's the biggest imposition in the world to show a certificate to show that you're vaccinated and wear a mask when you're buying a few beers. It's like the manifestation of this warped Blitz mentality that certain Brits have been dreaming of, taking joy in sneering at these weak Europeans.    2. **Poor governance** \- so I mean the UK had all the advantages; an island nation, a superlative and trusted national health service, fifth richest nation on earth, trusted media (in terms of BBC and Channel 4), low rates of vaccine skepticism and crucially, a relatively latecomer to the corona party. But we still managed to fuck it up. Monumentally. Moving from 'mustn't grumble' to 'call this number if you see your neighbour even talk to someone else in their house', making policies, then going back on them, ad infinitum. It's not as if there weren't a shortage of good examples to follow re policy (hi deutschland, greece, finland)- but hey, this government couldn't admit that Europe could do anything right, so it was prepared to kill tens of thousands of citizens just to prove a point. This timeline, published in late 2020, demonstrates how COVID-19 policy diverged in Germany and the UK and the results of British Tory poor choices. It ends last year but I wish they would post a follow up. Link [here](https://www.buzzfeed.com/albertonardelli/coronavirus-timeline-uk-germany-comparison-johnson-merkel).    3. Ending all public health measures in the UK just like that - so here in Germany, since May, things have slowly reopened. Not everything went smoothly - as a country with a private healthcare system, Germany was a goddamn shambles as once they vaccinated everyone vulnerable, they opened it up to everyone at once (cue people calling around 40 plus GPs to get a shot and sick people unable to get an appointment). But since mid-May, test centres which offered free lateral flow tests (called schnelltests here - quicktests) opened on every street corner. You had to get tested to get into anything inside - bars, clubs, cinemas, art galleries, etc - if you weren't vaccinated. I've had about five a week since a May, so with my shit maths, I've probably had several hundred tests. This is still the case to this day, and it was only last week that the government here ended free tests for residents, although you can pay 15 euro a time to take one, in easily accessible testing centres.  (And also for all the ignoramuses on this thread saying the UK tests so much - **Germany and many other European countries don't count lateral flow tests in their stats** \- and jesus, the UK is upping its PCR test rates by forcing people like me to take them to enter the UK, even though the rate in my area of Germany was 60/100,000 compared to 400/100,00 when I entered.Masks are worn on public transport and inside shops - and medical FF2P ones, not the blue bits of nothing some folk wear in the UK. You have to show your vaccination certificate to enter clubs inside (or recovery from the virus or a test - though most clubs won't accept tests now). It's pretty much the same in Greece, Portugal, France, Spain with added hand sanitiser - it's just the UK that's an outlier)     4. **Something has gone deeply wrong with English culture (see also selfishness and lack of solidarity)** \- I was back in (London and the South east for ten days this month. I was fucking stunned. I visited last August and London was like a ghost town. The sense of fear of palpable. Not this summer - no one gives a fuck. My friends are a mixture of first generation immigrants and Brits from a variety of backgrounds. No one wore masks, everyone moaned about restrictions, no one seemed to have any clue that the rest of Europe required vaccinations to enter, or to wear masks in shops and public transport. Two guys who I know and love and are otherwise decent, lovely people, threw mini tantrums about 'What a nightmare Europe is for requiring you to wear a mask on public transport' (a guy who works in healthcare) and a member of my own family refused to take a test to enter a venue, after getting annoyed about being asked for a vaccination certificate. Why wouldn't you feel happy to take these small measures to protect other people?!      I genuinely am deeply worried about the state of my home country after my visit - the culture just seems so horribly warped, small-minded, and disregarding of the huge amounts of people who have suffered. I know people who can't work because of long covid and their mates just shrug it off. Something has gone really, really horribly wrong and it makes me so sad. I'm just genuinely horrified.     Thanks for coming to my Tedtalk, lols. I guess I had a lot to say but for anyone who is British and still reading this far, what's happening in the UK right now is just so so so far from normal.

412,53,0,1631460048,"It did say that if they were symptomatic but unvaccinated, that they'd still get the full sick pay, presumably to slightly reduce the risk of a successful legal challenge.  The issue I could see arising, is that for an employee to demonstrate that they cannot take the vaccine in order to recieve full sick pay if they are asymptomatic, they'd need a doctor to certify this. As with regular sick notes, doctors cannot divulge details of a patients' condition to their employer, but they may feel that this question is too much of an incursion on patient confidentiality, given how few contraindications there are for these vaccines, and more critically they may feel that it adversely affects patient autonomy because the flipside of providing certificates for some leaves others penalised for failure to consent to a medical procedure. There's also variation in degree to which a doctor might be willing to certify someone with a relevant phobia or allergy, given that these can be managed for the vaccine but severe instances still strain the patient. Even if the courts decide that it is ok for an employer to seek such a certificate, the medical profession may have ethical qualms.  It also seems unclear why Morrisons cannot just insist that unvaccinated employees wear suitable PPE at all times when at work, provide this to them, and deploy their usual disciplinary procedures surrounding breach of health and safety rules for those who neglect to wear them correctly. Tbh I feel their primary motive is to advertise to customers that their supermarkets will be safer than alternatives, but there will be many employers eager to use any decision in Morrison's favour to chip away at things. In this instance, the intensity of the anti-vaxx movement and all of the publicity the situation generates means that unvaccinated employees of Morissons are likely to be well supported in bringing a case, but this would not be true for individuals facing ostensibly similar pressure around different health matters down the line unless they happen to be in a robust union.

(Masks are required outside one’s house, both indoors and outdoors, given the high population density.) His trial began today (05/08), during which his behaviour led him to be remanded for psychiatric assessment.  In today’s trial, Glynn  * claims to be a sovereign citizen and laws do not apply to him * says that he is ‘wide awake’, ‘enlightened’ and researched ‘everything’ but 'believes nothing' * mentions: ‘The certificate of vaccine regulations do not apply to the living man and I'm well aware of this fact.’ * claims to have ‘studied the law for hundreds and thousands of hours’ ([source](https://mothership.sg/2021/08/british-expat-no-mask-sovereign/))  In addition, a Singaporean man who was meant to be Glynn’s legal counsel was found to not be a solicitor. When asked, the man said he was ‘ambassador at large and advocate of Kingdom Filipina Hacienda’. The judge therefore ordered him to watch from the audience gallery.  Current discussion online seems to be divided on whether Glynn is truly mentally unwell. The prosecution received a letter from his family, stating that they have noticed a marked change in his behaviour which started after restrictions set in, with ‘leanings towards certain conspiracy theories’.

He had appeared in court with Glynn previously, but was stopped at the door for improper attire.  &gt; Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh told the court that the prosecution had performed their checks and confirmed that Mr Abdul Rashid was not an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore.  &gt; Mr Abdul Rashid said he is not, but that he is an ""ambassador at large and advocate of Kingdom Filipina Hacienda"", and that he was there to defend his ""sovereign compatriot"".  &gt; He said he understood the meaning of the bar, but said ""I don't need a licence to practice"".  &gt; Mr Koh told the court that the prosecution would be making an application for Glynn to be assessed at IMH, to see if he is of unsound mind.  &gt; **FAMILY AND FRIENDS SENT LETTER ON GLYNN'S BEHAVIOUR**  &gt; ""Prosecution has received a letter from the accused's family and friends or persons purporting to be his family and friends and in this letter, the persons report a marked change of behaviour in the accused's person that was noticeable especially after the COVID restrictions set in,"" he said.  &gt; Given this new information, as well as Glynn's behaviour in court and previous hearings and his choice of counsel, the prosecution said it would be ""prudent"" to assess Glynn to ensure he is of sound mind and capable of making his defence.  &gt; Glynn interrupted at multiple points. He told District Judge Eddy Tham: ""I assure you my mind is very sound. Every time I ask you hard questions, you can't answer me, you shoot me down. What law have I broken? I asked you three times the last time, you gave me silence, silence, silence.""  &gt; He added that he was ""wide awake"", ""enlightened"" and researched ""everything"" but believes nothing.  &gt; When Mr Koh added that Glynn's family members have reported his ""increasing hostility"" towards them, Glynn interjected: ""The certificate of vaccine regulations do not apply to the living man and I'm well aware of this fact.""  &gt; ""Why have the mask regulations been dropped all over American and Europe? Because they are unconstitutional. I don't get my information from the Straits Times.""  &gt; He asked if the prosecutor had seen his ""sovereign ID"", adding that he felt like ""a PhD law lecturer dealing with a GCE law student"".  &gt; He claimed that the police ""kidnapped and abducted"" him on his daughter's birthday, arresting him a second time at his hotel.  &gt; ""I hid in the bathroom and I said - I do not consent, I do not comply. They dragged me out of the shower and handcuffed me. I asked them what crime am I accused of committing. Silence,"" Glynn continued.  &gt; He claimed he spent 18 days ""being tortured in Changi Prison"".  &gt; ""What kind of justice is this, this is preposterous, and the torts against either living man that have been done against me include two unlawful arrests, two false imprisonments, two trespasses against me. They've stolen my passport, my God-given right to travel,"" he said.  &gt; He added that he understood the law ""better than anyone you've ever dealt with before"" and demanded to be released and sent back to England with his family, ""and let's not have a big fuss and scene over this"".  &gt; He continued that his defence is ""very solid and water-tight"" and that the prosecutor ""has no control over my legal fiction"".  &gt; ""I will never plead guilty or not guilty. I can't believe this has been going on since the 8th of May,"" Glynn said.  &gt; ""It's so straightforward it's so clear that this sham of a case should be dropped.""  &gt; A woman in the public gallery burst out laughing soon after this, and another woman waved two thumbs up at Glynn.  &gt; Judge Tham ordered Glynn to be remanded at IMH for two weeks and return to court on Aug 19.  &gt; At this, Glynn raised his voice, saying this is ""absolutely outrageous injustice"".  &gt; ""I am disgusted. How can you send an innocent man to prison when he has not been found guilty and the charges do not apply to him ... I am disgusted at how the Singapore judicial system has treated me and my family,"" he said.  &gt; The woman who had raised her thumbs at Glynn clapped very loudly at this point, and the judge reminded her to observe court decorum.  &gt; As proceedings wound down, Glynn called to the prosecutor: ""Good luck getting into the book of life, Mr Koh. Good luck with that one. How can you say Singapore is a safe country. Police who hunt me down like a pack of wild animals. This is not justice. This is disgusting. I am appalled.""  &gt; He added that he would be ""seeking lawful remedy"".  &gt; Glynn will be taken back to court in two weeks.

431,72,0,1627300332,"Double-jabbed expats free to travel to UK under relaxed vaccine rules People vaccinated overseas will be able to visit loved ones without having to self-isolate or undergo expensive tests   By Charles Hymas,  HOME AFFAIRS EDITOR ;  Harry Yorke,  WHITEHALL EDITOR and  Maighna Nanu 25 July 2021 • 9:30pm Eva Baroja and her boyfriend Alberto Eva Baroja and her boyfriend Alberto. Ms Baroja, a 25-year-old from Madrid, says the fact that the UK refuses to recognise vaccines administered in Spain 'does not make sense' Double-vaccinated expats are set to be free to travel to the UK, as the Government plans to recognise foreign jabs from August 1.  British families and couples have been separated by the current restriction on quarantine-free travel to and from amber list countries because the Government only recognises those people who have been vaccinated by the NHS.  However, ministers are preparing to change the rules to allow UK nationals who have been vaccinated overseas to register the jabs with their GP, clearing the way for them to return to the UK to visit family and friends without having to self-isolate for 10 days and pay for two PCR tests.  It could benefit some 300,000 expat British citizens living in just eight of the main EU countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and Portugal, 700,000 Britons in the US and a further 150,000 in France, once it is removed from its current ""amber-plus"" status.   Ministers are also expected to open up quarantine-free travel ""very soon"" to foreign nationals in a reciprocal deal with 33 countries that have recognised the NHS app.  This means that potentially millions of EU and US residents could visit the UK to see relatives living here - and it would open up the multi-billion-pound inward visitor market, which has been reduced to a fraction of pre-pandemic levels.  The changes come amid growing speculation that France might be returned to amber within the next fortnight, ending the “amber-plus” requirement for all arrivals from the country, including fully jabbed Britons, to quarantine for 10 days.  It follows a sharp decline in the prevalence of the beta variant of the covid virus in France, from nine per cent of cases to 2.6 per cent, the prime reason for the restrictions being imposed last week.  Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccines minister, foreshadowed the move on foreign jabs in a little-noticed debate in the Commons last week.  Vaccines Minister Nadim Zahawi pictured earlier this year Vaccines Minister Nadim Zahawi pictured earlier this year CREDIT: Heathcliff O'Malley/Heathcliff O'Malley He said: “By the end of this month, UK nationals who have been vaccinated overseas will be able to talk to their GP, go through what vaccine they have had and have it registered with the NHS that they have been vaccinated.  “The reasons for the conversation with the GP is to make sure that whatever vaccine they have had is approved in the UK. Ultimately there will be co-ordination between the WHO, ourselves, the European regulator and US regulator and other regulators around the world.  “Because we are working at speed at the moment, it is UK nationals and citizens who have had UK vaccinations who will be able to travel to amber list countries other than France and come back and not quarantine.  “We want to offer the same reciprocity as the 33 countries that recognise our app and that will also happen very soon.”  The 33 countries include Anguilla, Greece, Ireland, Barbados, Bulgaria, the Cayman Islands, Croatia, Gibraltar, Hong Kong, Iceland, Malta, Portugal, Spain, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Turkey, Germany and France.  Placeholder image for youtube video: g_ktqpHY4ac Most EU countries are part of the bloc’s travel pass scheme, which records both tests and vaccinations. The picture in the US is, however, more complicated with individual US states having different approaches to vaccination with 50 different types of certificate, some solely on paper.  Joss Croft, chief executive of UKinbound, welcomed Mr Zahawi’s “incredibly encouraging” comments, but urged the Government to accelerate the process: ‘’We need action now, not just hollow words that reciprocity will hopefully be implemented soon.  “The inbound tourism industry is on its knees and, even if reciprocity is rolled out tomorrow, thousands of businesses and jobs will continue to be at risk, leaving the sector in desperate need of targeted support.’’  Case study: 'I haven't seen my girlfriend in over three months'  Mr Fisher, who works for a marketing consultancy, had hoped that once he was fully vaccinated the situation would change. Mr Fisher, who works for a marketing consultancy, had hoped that once he was fully vaccinated the situation would change Thomas Fisher, 26, is a British and French dual national who has lived in Paris for three years.  His girlfriend and all his close friends live in London. Before the pandemic he used to go back to the capital at least once or twice a month. But Covid restrictions have meant he has only been able to visit twice in over a year.  He told The Telegraph: “There have been periods of time where we haven’t seen each other for over three months because of the travel restrictions imposed by the UK. Before the pandemic we would see each other every other week. Obviously the French vaccine being recognised by the UK would make a big difference for us.""  Mr Fisher, who works for a marketing consultancy, had hoped that once he was fully vaccinated the situation would change.  He said: “I literally check the news all the time to see if there are any plans on the UK accepting the French vaccine because that would allow me to go to the UK and see my friends. It would be a lot more flexible because I wouldn't have to quarantine.""  Mr Fisher said the fact his double vaccination is not recognised is ""annoying.""  He added: ""It feels like you're being discriminated against because I am British, and it is the exact same vaccine. I am not planning on going to the UK for a while because I am not going to do the quarantine.""  Case study: Fees and quarantine are 'an injustice'  Eva Baroja, a 25-year-old from Madrid, says the fact that the UK refuses to recognise vaccines administered in Spain ""does not make sense"".  Ms Baroja, whose boyfriend of seven years, Alberto, lives in London, says the pandemic has been ""really hard"" as they waited for restrictions to be lifted.  She was fully vaccinated with Pfizer at the beginning of July, but says if she wanted to travel to London she would have to pay upwards of €300 and quarantine upon arrival. She called the restrictions ""an injustice.""  She told The Telegraph: ""If British people are fully vaccinated they can holiday in Majorca and Ibiza and have a great summer and go back home without quarantining. But I have to pay for three Covid tests and self-quarantine just to visit my boyfriend in London.""  If the UK does recognise vaccines given to foreign nationals overseas, it means that Ms Baroja and her family will be able to visit Alberto in London in two weeks. If not, her parents will have to cancel their trip.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/orwyl3/doublejabbed_expats_free_to_travel_to_uk_under/h6ks40p/

The closest I came to taking the vaccine was when it looked like July 19th was happening with no ifs or buts. Maybe I was wrong to think the government were going to end up trying to force this on me, I thought. Maybe it was conspiracy nonsense after all. And that lasted, what, 17 hours? On the evening of July 19th Bojo announces that the vax pass will become mandatory in nightclubs and *other unspecified settings* with no option for a negative test instead.

Please spare me the comparison with driving licenses or yellow fever certificates.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm tempted to say ""Fine, I'll get this vaccine but then I'm done"" but I know full well that when this passport/certificate is brought in, booster shots can be put on there and now I've bought into a system where my previous 2 jabs were for nout if I haven't had the latest booster. That's not even unlikely, seeing as they're already talking about booster jabs for the vulnerable this autumn, and initially they were considering only vaccinating the vulnerable full stop. It may not happen yet, but there'll inevitably by a variant that crops up that ""requires"" the latest booster, or it will become apparent that immunity wanes significantly over time.

480,41,3,1639566489,"&gt;Why against covid certification?  I'm against them first and foremostly because they have been proven, by [studies](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/229153/vaccine-passports-linked-covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy/), to *increase* vaccine hesitancy.   COVID-19 vaccines have little (and decreasing) ability to protect against transmission of the virus, but they are able to prevent severe disease and even death. It's extremely important that people get vaccinated, but COVID passports entrench the unvaccinated and may even turn people against getting their boosters. They create a sense that vaccines are being used to control people rather than help them. And even worse - the conduit for the backlash caused by that perception is usually the National Health Service. That, to my mind, is more dangerous than just letting an unvaccinated person into an establishment to spread the virus - something that, whether they're vaccinated or not, would be happening anyway.  [The Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Select Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Administration_and_Constitutional_Affairs_Select_Committee) also published [a report](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/327/public-administration-and-constitutional-affairs-committee/news/157355/covid-passport-policy-lacks-scientific-evidence-base/) in September 2021 noting that COVID passport policies ack a scientific evidence base. And since then, real world application in similar countries to England like Wales, Scotland, and France have shown that they have little to no effect on viral spread. France has possibly the strictest COVID passport policy in the world and yet they have similar daily case numbers to the UK right now and are in the midst of their second biggest wave - England is in the same position, and we have not had COVID passports until now.  On a personal note: my mum's family are Irish Catholics from Northern Ireland. I have an extreme aversion to segregation. Barring the unvaccinated from participating in society, [especially when so many of them are of an ethnic minority makeup](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(21)00157-5/fulltext), is a bit dodgy to me.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/rgn50a/jeremy_corbyn_votes_against_compulsory_jab_for/homqp79/

You could be there for hours prior to that time but the second it hits 1am you have to show it. What's the sense behind that?  Like all decisions, there are compromises and balances to be achieved. It would be most effective to require everyone to wear a mask at all times, to mandate the type of mask, and so on. But that's not practical, or going to be accepted by the public.

488,49,3,1639507254,"As per a report that the cross-party parliamentary Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee published in September...  &gt;Covid passports are being introduced for entry to some venues, including nightclubs and live sporting events, to control the spread of the virus according to the Government. However, new analysis and a lack of evidence provided by the Government in its response to the Committee’s report casts doubt on whether this will work.   &gt;   &gt;\[...\] the latest analysis by Public Health England (PHE) found that although being fully vaccinated protects against infection and severe symptoms, it unlikely to do much to stop the spread of the virus if people become infected. Jabbed and unjabbed individuals carry similar amounts of the virus.   &gt;   &gt;Concerns over viral load of the Delta variant appeared in Sage meeting minutes from 22 July. Sage, the Government’s scientific advisory panel, warned that there is ‘limited vaccine effect against onward transmission’ of the variant. Given that this meeting was held before the Government responded to the Committee’s report, the Committee has severe concerns about the way in which this policy has been developed and kept under consideration.  “We have often heard throughout the pandemic that the Government will follow the science, but when afforded the opportunity to provide it on Covid passports, it has failed to do so. All we have is a flimsy claim that there is a public health case, but without any foundation for the claim to stand on.”  “With recent analysis suggesting that vaccinated people carry as much of the virus as the unvaccinated into any setting, the disappointing lack of any scientific basis for the Government’s decision to go ahead could reasonably lead people to conclude that there is in fact no such basis. If the real goal is to drive vaccine uptake, then it is a deeply cynical approach that will be counterproductive.”  “Following through on such a costly, discriminatory and, potentially, ineffective policy will have consequences for trust in and acceptance of the Government’s measures to tackle the pandemic. It’s surely either time to prove how this’ll work or to put an end to it.”  Or let's just take a look at France, who have a similarly sized population as the UK *and* an incredibly strict COVID passport programme, and currently have a 7 day case average of +48,000 - not dissimilar to the UK's +51,000 7 day case average.  They do not fucking work, and the Wikipedia article you linked is talking about quarantine certificates, not COVID passports.  &gt;the public health measures being mandated are neither oppressive nor authoritarian  I'm sure the people present at Sarah Everard's wake, the Kill The Bill protestors who got their faces fucking smashed in with riot shields because they were 'violating COVID-19 restrictions', the university students who had the police pin them into their accommodation blocks, etc. would agree with you.

519,80,0,1639041570,"Thanks for replying! (and not downvoting!) As background, I'm a bartender in Calgary, Alberta, a very conservative province, with a scientific background (job market sucks here) I scan peoples' vaccine QR codes daily. A second note: vaccine passports in Alberta are for pubs, restaurants, clubs, cinemas/theatre, and any sporting event (indoor or outdoor). Supermarkets, clothing stores, liquor stores, ect cannot ask for proof of vaccination.  I get the aversion to being ID'd to get in to place on medical grounds, I was initially very against it. But we hit our 4th wave in Ab very fast and very hard. It is a comfort to me if I am in a crowded bar that I know every single person there is double vaccinated, including staff.  Now, we have all shown our drivers licence to be served in a pub, even if it was X years ago. From my experience as a frequent pub-goer and barman, there is only 1 extra step now (in Alberta): I have an app on my phone that will scan a QR code in less than a second. If you are vaccinated, I get a name, date of birth, and a big green tick. That is all. If you are not vaccinated, I get a name, date of birth, and a big red X. I cross check the name and DoB with a photo ID (licence, passport, ect). I get no other info. I cannot access any other info, the app doesn't allow it. If the info checks out, get in the bar and drink to your hearts content. If not, you have to leave.  In regards to personal health information, vaccination status is less personal, but more societal. We all get vaccines to protect those who cannot. As someone who scans vaccine ID's daily, I don't see any info, I also don't care, just order drinks. For the measures we use, there is no way to access medical info.   I agree on the govt fucking it up, though. But I also have an incompetent govt and they did it well. In the end (we initially had PDF files...that weren't locked and easily edited. Then moved to QR code only) The NHS organised the entire vaccine rollout incredibly well with minimal govt interference - maybe they could also deal with any vaccine passporting?   With regards to personal liberties...yeah you do have a say with what you put in to your body, I won't advocate forcing people to get a vaccine they don't want. But you have no right to enter a business and infect other people. You can do what you want but pubs and restaurants are private businesses, if they refuse to serve someone based on vaccine status, it is their right. That is how it works here - pubs and restaurants do not have to check vaccine status - but if they do not, they can only operate patios and beer gardens. It can get to -30 here so, most opted in.  Vaccination rates shot up when this was announced - went from 6000 1st doses to 16,000 1st doses in 24 hours. Turns out, people care way a lot about being able to drink in a bar. Stats linked below  TL;DR I don't like vaccine passports, but I feel so much safer and relaxed with them.

Excluded from pubs restaurants and sports facilities. I will not comply with any future lockdowns, still less with ones that apply specifically to the unvaccinated. I will march. I am willing to lose my job in solidarity with unvaccinated colleagues without a moment's hesitation and my home will always be open to offer refuge to anyone else made jobless or homeless by the purges. I am willing to drain the entirety of my life savings into this project and sell my possessions to get more funds if required. My wife and daughter support me. This is not bluster. This is what I am going to do. So help me God.  This is what it means to play at the grown-ups table, sunshine.

One of the big unspoken problems on my side of the debate is that most our scientists are elderly &amp; retired (those still in employ have a lot to lose) and speak with dry shaky voices and are rather boring. Dr Bill Gray (deceased) was great, but he was a struggle to listen to.

But on other hand, still no one has ever seen Obama's original birth certificate; it's perfectly plausible that it was destroyed, but affluent families like the Obamas tend to keep items like that quite safe.   I don't think Tony Heller ever made much mention of the birth certificate. He did however publish this: [https://realclimatescience.com/2017/01/exposing-the-first-birther/](https://realclimatescience.com/2017/01/exposing-the-first-birther/)  According to Barrack Obama's literary agent, he was born in Kenya, raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.   Now that really did get me thinking ""huh???"". It's nothing conclusive, it's just really odd. Perhaps it was a PR thing and Barack Obama was happy at the time to falsely claim that he was born in Kenya to seem more cosmopolitan?

602,163,0,1632468179,"#BBC’s lack of Tory scrutiny is ‘failing’ viewers, research finds   *Laura Webster*  ---   THE BBC has been accused of “failing to deliver” on its editorial guidelines after it emerged that its flagship News at Six did not run a single negative news story about the UK Government last week.  From September 13-17 no stories on the UK-wide news programme featured negative framing of the Westminster Government, research by The National found.  During the same period, Reporting Scotland ran 10 stories about the Scottish Government with a negative framing.  The disparity was identified as political stories on both the News at Six and Reporting Scotland were recorded each evening and categorised based on whether they featured a positive, negative or neutral framing of each government. Negative framing typically includes someone being “accused” of something or forced to “defend” an action.   The News at Six mainly featured stories that were neutral towards the UK Government, with 17 of the total 24 political stories using this framing. There was also one positively framed story about the UK Government, one neutral package about the Scottish Government and one negatively framed segment on Holyrood.  Meanwhile Reporting Scotland featured just six neutrally framed stories about the SNP government, compared to 10 negative ones. Every UK Government story was framed in a neutral light, and there was just one positive Scottish Government piece.  It is the third time this year The National has carried out the research, and the third time Reporting Scotland has been noticeably more critical of Holyrood than the News at Six has been of Westminster.  Rona Mackay (below), SNP MSP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, criticised the BBC over the findings.  “The BBC is mandated to ‘due impartiality in all its output’ – but they are failing to deliver on their own editorial guidelines,” she told The National.  “It is hard to believe Reporting Scotland and its sensationalist reporting are from the same organisation as the too-often acquiescent BBC News at Six.  “BBC bosses needs to explain to audiences the gross disparity in their editorial treatment between north and south of the Border.”  Most stories with a negative framing of the Scottish Government focused on health last week, with stories covering high ambulance response times, increased Covid-19 deaths, hospitality groups’ criticism of vaccine passport plans and a technical issue preventing full reporting of daily coronavirus figures.  Health stories on the News at Six, however, were presented to viewers through a neutral lens despite touching on similar themes of Covid-19 and planning to see the NHS through a difficult winter.  The 17 neutral stories also included coverage of the Westminster debate on cutting Universal Credit, a move which could push 800,000 people into poverty, according to research from the Legatum Institute think tank.  A spokesperson for the BBC said: “Journalists across the BBC always strive for fairness, accuracy and impartiality in their reporting of news stories for our audiences across all our platforms.”  The new research has been revealed after the Scottish Government hit back at Scottish Tory claims that ministers had put up a “wall of silence” over problems facing the NHS and ambulance service.  At the weekend, BBC Scotland interviewed Tory MSP and GP Sandesh Gulhane – with presenter Martin Geissler saying Humza Yousaf and Jason Leitch had refused to appear on the Sunday Show.  A spokesperson for the Holyrood Government said the Conservatives’ claims were “false”.  “Government and ministers have been working around the clock and will continue doing so to keep the public informed and to support the NHS through the exceptional and unique pressures it is facing due to the global pandemic,” they said.  “Ministers and clinicians have spoken to the media almost every day last week – the Health Secretary was interviewed on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and today [Sunday], the First Minister addressed Parliament on Thursday and the national clinical director was interviewed on Thursday and Friday.”",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/puepr3/bbcs_lack_of_tory_scrutiny_is_failing_viewers/he2cp4g/

611,172,5,1631896892,"We already have the passport. I have used it to go to Silverstone. It's on the NHS app. And there already exists a public database of valid QR codes. You can download an app from the store right now. No money needed.  With almost 90% of the adult population vaccinated, we can't get much further by people's free will. We are only making 24'000 doses a day. The campaign is stuck, and most of the remaining people won't get the vaccine whatsoever.  Yet, 90% may not be sufficient to prevent a public health crisis in case a new wave or variant comes. Even more as vaccines lose a bit of efficacy, and some people may be against getting a third dose.  Again, not getting vaccinated against such an infectious and sufficiently lethal disease has widespread effects on the society as a whole, and not just one's own health. If you want to keep this choice personal by not introducing a mandate, you need to curb on the public health effects by not allowing unvaxxed people into high-risk events.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ppyd78/bbc_news_covid_vaccine_and_test_passes_to_be/hd84zuj/
612,173,6,1631899650,"It doesn’t create an incentive, it effectively mandates it if you need one to do anything to be involved with society. Which is the entire ethical problem currently being debated here. It creates a two tier system in society which further increases discrimination. It is widely accepted among experts that mandating, whether through direct law or through covert means like this, hinders the uptake of the vaccine - something you are advocating for, more uptake.  Like I’ve said, why do you need a passport if the majority of the population is vaccinated? Naturally, the risk is reduced by an order of magnitude for everyone.   If a new variant arises, which is actually quite likely, the passports mean nothing. They are inconsequential in stopping this from getting any worse or better. It’s just more control and more surveillance for the government, which as history shows us, is never ever, a good thing.  And it shouldn’t be in widespread use, this is a good thing.  I’m afraid it’s not as clean cut as you make out. Age and medical data are completely leagues apart from one another. I work with complex data on a daily basis and medical information is up there as one of the most sensitive classifications of data a person has about themselves. I’ve never had to enter a pub and provide proof of any other vaccination because it is absolutely no one else’s business and never ever should be, unless in an appropriate setting I.e. a conversation with your doctor who is bound by many many laws and codes to keep this data safe.  Showing proof of age is acceptable because it’s not very sensitive data... You can at least deduct just through visuals how old someone is, that’s why not everyone gets ID checked at a club or for buying alcohol in a supermarket.  The point you are missing is if this allowed to happen en-masse and becomes the norm, they will be able to mandate anything.

613,174,7,1631902187,"&gt;It doesn’t create an incentive, it effectively mandates it if you need one to do anything to be involved with society  No, it doesn't. You can still test or avoid going to places. A mandate means that if you are not vaccinated, you get fined heavily if you don't vaccinate your children your parental rule can be overridden by public health officials, and so on.  For example, passports are not mandatory. However, if you don't have one you can't go to places. Blood tests are not mandatory, nor are condoms, but if you don't test and you have unprotected sex you can't donate blood. And so on. Vaccination won't be mandatory, but if you don't get vaccinated nor want to test with the free LFTs... well, you won't be able to go to places. Easy.  &gt;Like I’ve said, why do you need a passport if the majority of the population is vaccinated?  The ""majority"" of the population is vaccinated also in the US. However, you can see how several states are saturating their hospitals despite it being summer (so people spending more time outdoor). Is the 89% in the UK enough to prevent hospitals from getting full? In case of a strong wave, even without a new variation probably not. Full hospitals mean postponing other types of healthcare, putting other hospital patients at risk etc...  &gt;I work with complex data on a daily basis  Me too. So you should know that one of the things that can make such a system acceptable is a simple rule of not storing the data and not showing the reason of your pass. People will know you have the passport, but not why. It could be due to testing or vaccination. Or exemption. Or whatever other reason. You won't be able to tell novaxxers from vaxxed people, exempt from vaxxed, and exempt from novaxxers. The only thing you will get to know is that that person is either vaccinated or does not have covid, and thus is allowed to enter a venue (if they had covid and knew it, they should be barred anyway as by law).  &gt;The point you are missing is if this allowed to happen en-masse and becomes the norm, they will be able to mandate anything. Personal freedom and choice is something we should never ever ever take for granted because once it’s gone, it’s seriously fucking hard to get back.  Again, this is a legitimate argument. I may agree for the UK more than for other countries (due to the common law system and lack of a proper Constitution), but the other arguments do not make any sense. I have told you what is the point of passports (avoid clogging up hospitals), that they already exist and are based on a fully functional system (no need to spend money, just open your NHS app and you'll find your pass), and that this does not reveal any information regarding your health record (you have clearly never opened your NHS domestic covid pass, have't you?), nor your ""checks"" get stored.  Even the legitimate concern that mandatory vaccines may reduce uptake may be true under certain circumstances, but not in general. For example, a mandatory covid vaccine may reduce public confidence in the institutions for the future, but I would expect the covid vaccination rate to go up, and fast. It happened in France and Italy. Again, Italy recently had to introduce harsh vaccine mandates and strengthen their enforcement as a lot of people just stopped vaccinating their children against deadly diseases due to fake news and social media resonance chambers, with vaccination rates for some of the ""normal"" vaccines dropping to 85-90%. After the mandate was introduced a few years ago, vaccination rates are up a gain to close to 100%.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ppyd78/bbc_news_covid_vaccine_and_test_passes_to_be/hd8hmos/
614,175,8,1631905772,"Currently, I agree with you on the mandated, it isn’t. However, my concern is that it isn’t financial consequences, it’s the discrimination and societal pressures that have consequences on people. Purely anecdotal, but my brother has PTSD and for that reason couldn’t wear a mask, it triggered him and he was regularly met with abuse because he wasn’t wearing a mask in a public setting. It’s these people I’m trying to defend and introducing measures like vaccine passports has wide reaching consequences that I just don’t think you are willing to even entertain or admit they are real.  I could probably align with you if the vaccine stopped all transmission and was a silver bullet to stop covid altogether - but it isn’t. We are told almost every winter the NHS is due to collapse due to the flu (again, I’m not an idiot, covid is more serious than the flu, but the main point stands, we don’t require a passport for other transmissible diseases which supposedly bring the NHS to its knees every winter) so why would give up liberties for this? Why would we prevent people from being active members of a society? If someone is clinically unable to have a vaccine, no amount of testing or passports is going to protect them, thus making the entire idea useless, the only use would be handing over control to the government for artificial purposes.  Travel passports are completely different. I do not need one domestically to enter a pub or a venue, unless it’s being used for ID purposes in place of a driving license or any other officially recognised ID, which is a completely different context to the one in which you referred to.  Abstracting data away or down to a yes or no or other simplified context does not decrease the sensitivity of the data when used in a personal context, that’s why we have things like password fields on login forms, the data is abstracted from view, but is still sensitive. Vaccination data or health data in general is sensitive, which is why we have super strict laws to keep it that way. The idea of having a passport doesn’t work in practise also. Who decides the validity of the passport? What system does it get checked against? A centralised government database? Government systems are generally shite and outdated and couldn’t cope with a nationalised rollout on such scale and demand. What would the infrastructure look like to enable this? Every single enclosed space in the country would need some kind of validation system to make sure it was all correct or the effectiveness of the passport system is essentially non-existent. It’s all good showing a phone screen or piece of paper but can it actually be verified? In this case the data you refer to has absolutely no integrity, therefore making it absolutely useless to do anything with. I have opened the app tbh, it’d be incredibly easy to take a screenshot and doctor it, hence the need for validation infrastructure, which I wouldn’t trust our government to implement in a month of Sunday’s given how poorly designed and poorly engineered the test and trace app was.  The whole point of the vaccine is to stop clogging up hospitals, if a tiny proportion of the population (I think your over exaggerating how many people are genuine anti-vaxxers) don’t get vaccinated it will be negligible on terms of the overall outcome, especially considering that people who have the vaccine can also still be hospitalised, again the vaccine does not eliminate covid.  The UK government are renowned for the “surveillance state”, this is no untruth. If you work with data like you say, you will understand how much the government are hell bent in knowing where we are, who we’re with and so on. This concern that “giving an inch and they will take a mile” is not unfounded, if we let me mandate things like this, it’ll be a hell of a lot easier to mandate more intrusive things in the future. I can almost say with certainty that most of the powers granted to the government in the COVID Act as temporary measures will remain in law.  So better education and combating fake news seems like a better alternative to increase uptake in any vaccine, as most experts do agree.   A vaccine passport is not necessary at all, if people are vaccinated, which the majority are, the risk in the NHS collapsing is reduced by an order of magnitude. It’s widely impractical in my opinion and I’m a strong advocate for peoples privacy, personal data, personal responsibility and personal choice. I also don’t believe everyone who opts out of having the vaccine is a raging lunatic that succumbed to fake news, it’s just simply their choice and they shouldn’t be excluded from society, they should still have the same rights as anyone else.  I don’t think we’ll agree and that is completely fine, we don’t have to agree that’s beauty of personal freedom!

I myself am fully vaccinated, but respect the decision of of others to hesitate as long as their decision is made from an educated standpoint.  Naturally there is a significant amount of misinformation on this topic, and others, but would it not make more sense to make social media corporates responsible for, and profiting from, disinformation than to force people to make uneducated decisions?

750,311,6,1630264963,"&gt;The data simply does not support this belief.   Yep, vaccine acceptance is pretty high, but there's nothing wrong with aiming to have higher acceptance than 88%. Every extra person who uses the relatively small resources to get vaccinated reduces strain on our health system. And since you like anecdotes so much, I suggest you look at some of the comments from medical professionals on here about their feelings on this. Or here's a wider survey if you don't want to listen to random people on the internet https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/226513/many-icu-staff-have-experienced-mental/  &gt; but it would be far cheaper and easier to offer a £100 payment to each fully vaccinated young adult   Yeah, I'm not against that idea. Sounds fine to me. But I see no issue with having it alongside vaccine passports.  &gt;**3) Vaccine passports ignore natural immunity due to prior infection**  &gt;There is now a good body of evidence showing that recovery from prior infection offers strong protection against re-infection. Freaking out about 34% of young adults being unvaccinated ignores the fact that a substantial portion of them will already have protection (90% of 30-year-olds were found to already have antibodies against Covid). If there truly is a concern about unvaccinated young people,   &gt; surely the problem will solve itself quickly as they get infected by and recover from Covid.   People don't just 'recover from covid'. They put an entirely unnecessary burden on our healthcare system. It seems you have very little empathy for the people working hard to save idiots who don't give a damn about others.  &gt;  by now everyone choosing to remain unvaccinated is willingly taking that risk.  There are plenty of people who are simply apathetic to it. The portion of diehard antivaxxers is quite small.   https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1138  Plenty of people are open to putting in the effort to get one.  &gt;The argument that the unvaccinated pose a threat to the vaccinated does not stack up. While vaccines offer strong protection against serious illness or death from Covid, the most recent data emerging from highly vaccinated countries (such as Israel or Gibraltar) shows that vaccines are less effective at preventing infection.  Which studies are you referring to? Because from what I can see, the evidence is quite clear that vaccines reduce the spread of infection  https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n338  &gt;Once pubs and other venues are forced to implement a mechanism for checking everyone’s vaccine passports on entry,  Who said pubs should be forced to do this? I've never argued that.  &gt; it will become trivially easy to expand the system to advance other social objectives, and transform Britain into a “papers, please” society.   Well, I agree that pubs shouldn't be forced to do this, but I don't think it would be any worse than requiring pubs to stop smoking indoors, or telling people to wear seatbelts in their own car. What a lot of people don't seem to understand is that we have a social healthcare system. It costs people resources to look after others who harm themselves unnecessarily.  &gt; What about banning criminals and other social undesirables? Once it’s normal for pubs, why not roll it out to all public venues?  That's nonsense. The point of our justice system is rehabilitation. Criminals are not 'social undesirables', assuming that our justice system is working remotely well.  &gt; Not because I'm against flu jabs, but because I have never needed one.   Getting a flu jab isn't just for you. You seem to be one of those people who doesn't really grasp that vaccines are not just for the person receiving them. Some nice info from the CDC here:  https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/misconceptions.htm  &gt;The sad thing is that you *talk* like a government official even though you aren't one.   Indeed I am not. I am quite critical of this government and think it's one of the worst the UK has seen in a century. My stance on this issue is the same regardless of what the government holds as a stance. Taking issue with the 'way' I talk is rather odd, and perhaps reflects your own bias, rather than an objective style.  &gt; The people who actually have power couldn't give less of a toss about you and yet here you are fighting their battle for them (poorly) for free. What happened?  Thankfully, as poor as our voting systems are, the morons in charge still care very much about getting votes.

Regarding backing up opinions - You seem to have misunderstood - I was referring to your strongly held opinion that the majority of people do not want a vaccine passport - which seems to be based on absolutely nothing, and is contrary to the only egidence available.

Of course not. It should be properly considered and debated.  I gave you some examples of reasons why we shouldn't have them.

Your thinking seems a bit fuzzy.  What I was trying to say was that a vaccine passport would mean that you would need something to prove you have had a vaccine, whether this is on your phone or some form of physical identity card.  Something you can easily forget, thus making life more difficult for people than it really needs to be,   Yes, I admit this wasn't well thought out. ;)  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;We can't dictate policy by whatever stupidity conspiracy theorists will cook up.

To me, vaccine passports are just a backdoor way to try and do this.  Something which I really think is a dangerous situation to be in.  Medical intervention has always been an individuals decision.  We have never had enforcement on any other vaccine, and although we are in a middle of a pandemic, the onus should be on the government to convince people into having the vaccine and not to punish people into it.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;How so?

763,324,1,1630004729,"&gt; However, I feel that those who want them should be the ones to convince everyone else why they are a good idea, why they would benefit everyone.  Simply put, if a vaccine means that someone has less chance of transmitting a potentially fatal virus, it is of interest to people whether someone they are in contact with is vaccinated. Vaccine passports are merely official documentation for that.  You seem to be persisting with the strawman that somehow vaccine passports do not account for people who cannot receive a vaccine, yet of course, they do. The few situations where they have been rolled out recently also account for people who haven't had the vaccine, but have actually been ill with the virus.  &gt; at the moment the majority of people who will have a vaccine have probably already had one by now.  Some people take more convincing than others. This is quite natural, and we shouldn't give up at the first sign of difficulty.  &gt; The people who you now have to convince are those conspiracy theorists and those who are reluctant to for whatever reason.  Fortunately not. There are still plenty of people who are simply uninformed or apathetic, I know some of them in person.  &gt; Punishing them into getting a vaccine, by restricting their freedoms   You're back on the strawman arguments - where did anyone say a vaccine passport is restricting freedoms? If you mean that certain situations will limit access based upon vaccination status, isn't that entirely reasonable? For example, working at a care home? It's entirely standard to limit access to certain elements of society well before covid was a thing. You need a pilots license to fly a plane for example, but are you complaining that other people's freedoms have been restricted? Some people would certainly make that argument, but I dare say it's a pretty bad one.   The reason we don't let just anyone fly planes is that it can cause damage to other people - it's the same with someone wanting to be unvaccinated. They're perfectly entitled to remain unvaccinated, but they won't have access to situations where they can harm others through their decision.  I suppose you will also argue that it's unreasonable to have laws restricting guns and knives in the UK? This is very much an argument in some countries.

For example, a nightclub could decide to require a vaccine passport, while another wouldn't need to. The NHS could decide that vaccine passports are required for staff.

Both scenarios a driving license and a vaccine passport, are Authoritarian measures where you require to go through a process and obtain some sort of identity card in order to make use of a service.  Both are done with the aim of protecting public health.  That's why the comparison is brought up, you may find one of these authoritarian measures more reasonable than the other and you may in fact have a point, but the problem here is no one who is bringing up a drivers license in regards to peoples opposition to vaccine passports is saying they are of equal value.

He called the proceedings ""preposterous"" and ""disgusting"".  &gt; His supporters filled the courtroom, with one woman repeatedly laughing and another clapping loudly when Glynn slammed Singapore's judiciary. Court officers stepped in to stop them at various points.  &gt; Thursday was meant to be Glynn's first day of trial, but he insisted he would not be pleading guilty or not guilty as it was ""nonsense"".  &gt; The hearing opened with Glynn trying to introduce his legal counsel, a Mr Abdul Rashid Abdul Rahman. He had appeared in court with Glynn previously, but was stopped at the door for improper attire.  &gt; Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh told the court that the prosecution had performed their checks and confirmed that Mr Abdul Rashid was not an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore.  &gt; Mr Abdul Rashid said he is not, but that he is an ""ambassador at large and advocate of Kingdom Filipina Hacienda"", and that he was there to defend his ""sovereign compatriot"".  &gt; He said he understood the meaning of the bar, but said ""I don't need a licence to practice"".  &gt; Mr Koh told the court that the prosecution would be making an application for Glynn to be assessed at IMH, to see if he is of unsound mind.  &gt; **FAMILY AND FRIENDS SENT LETTER ON GLYNN'S BEHAVIOUR**  &gt; ""Prosecution has received a letter from the accused's family and friends or persons purporting to be his family and friends and in this letter, the persons report a marked change of behaviour in the accused's person that was noticeable especially after the COVID restrictions set in,"" he said.  &gt; Given this new information, as well as Glynn's behaviour in court and previous hearings and his choice of counsel, the prosecution said it would be ""prudent"" to assess Glynn to ensure he is of sound mind and capable of making his defence.  &gt; Glynn interrupted at multiple points. He told District Judge Eddy Tham: ""I assure you my mind is very sound. Every time I ask you hard questions, you can't answer me, you shoot me down. What law have I broken? I asked you three times the last time, you gave me silence, silence, silence.""  &gt; He added that he was ""wide awake"", ""enlightened"" and researched ""everything"" but believes nothing.  &gt; When Mr Koh added that Glynn's family members have reported his ""increasing hostility"" towards them, Glynn interjected: ""The certificate of vaccine regulations do not apply to the living man and I'm well aware of this fact.""  &gt; ""Why have the mask regulations been dropped all over American and Europe? Because they are unconstitutional. I don't get my information from the Straits Times.""  &gt; He asked if the prosecutor had seen his ""sovereign ID"", adding that he felt like ""a PhD law lecturer dealing with a GCE law student"".  &gt; He claimed that the police ""kidnapped and abducted"" him on his daughter's birthday, arresting him a second time at his hotel.  &gt; ""I hid in the bathroom and I said - I do not consent, I do not comply. They dragged me out of the shower and handcuffed me. I asked them what crime am I accused of committing. Silence,"" Glynn continued.  &gt; He claimed he spent 18 days ""being tortured in Changi Prison"".  &gt; ""What kind of justice is this, this is preposterous, and the torts against either living man that have been done against me include two unlawful arrests, two false imprisonments, two trespasses against me. They've stolen my passport, my God-given right to travel,"" he said.  &gt; He added that he understood the law ""better than anyone you've ever dealt with before"" and demanded to be released and sent back to England with his family, ""and let's not have a big fuss and scene over this"".  &gt; He continued that his defence is ""very solid and water-tight"" and that the prosecutor ""has no control over my legal fiction"".  &gt; ""I will never plead guilty or not guilty. I can't believe this has been going on since the 8th of May,"" Glynn said.  &gt; ""It's so straightforward it's so clear that this sham of a case should be dropped.""  &gt; A woman in the public gallery burst out laughing soon after this, and another woman waved two thumbs up at Glynn.  &gt; Judge Tham ordered Glynn to be remanded at IMH for two weeks and return to court on Aug 19.  &gt; At this, Glynn raised his voice, saying this is ""absolutely outrageous injustice"".  &gt; ""I am disgusted. How can you send an innocent man to prison when he has not been found guilty and the charges do not apply to him ... I am disgusted at how the Singapore judicial system has treated me and my family,"" he said.  &gt; The woman who had raised her thumbs at Glynn clapped very loudly at this point, and the judge reminded her to observe court decorum.  &gt; As proceedings wound down, Glynn called to the prosecutor: ""Good luck getting into the book of life, Mr Koh. Good luck with that one. How can you say Singapore is a safe country. Police who hunt me down like a pack of wild animals. This is not justice. This is disgusting. I am appalled.""  &gt; He added that he would be ""seeking lawful remedy"".  &gt; Glynn will be taken back to court in two weeks.

The specific issue is that I am against the implementation as a digital ID tied to our complete medical history and other databases and able to be varied centrally without user input. On a basic level, the way they are implemented means the administrator of the system could simply change the data in the ID to indicate that you are not vaccinated and you would be immediately banned from anywhere that requires your vaccine passport. There’s no way to protest or appeal this. People just assume that the id status is correct. The manner of implementation also makes them very easy to add further things like banning orders, driving bans etc Then, because they can be updated remotely, it allows the authorities to effectively ban you from places remotely and without your authority. The example I give is that it is quite possible to tweak the system so that if you are spotted at a demonstration causing a nuisance (set to be made illegal) you could then have your digital ID instantly and remotely modified to set you as “unauthorised” person and de facto ban you from society. Again there appears to be no good way to appeal or change this.  The more general issue is that they would provide an infectious vaccinated person with more rights than an unvaccinated person who can prove they are not infectious. If you had to prove you are not infectious *and* vaccinated then this objection would fall away.

829,390,3,1627238514,"&gt;Is the vaccine working exactly as anticipated? There are fairly hefty side effects, one of the reasons other mRNA experiments have never got past primary testing. I won't muddy the waters with anecdotal evidence as we both know it's not really admissable in this sort of discussion, but recorded side effects are, and they are not to be ignored (pleurisy, myocarditis, etc etc).  Now I can see you're arguing in bad faith, because the side effect profile of hese vaccines is extremely low. Far lower than the vast, vast majority of medicines out there. People get irrationally hung up on vaccine side effects.  &gt;As I say, I'm far from an anti-vaxxer, I'm a veritable pin cushion from growing up in the West and then travelling around the world. In fact, I may be rare in this discussion in that I already have a vaccine passport: for yellow fever, a disease with a death rate of between 15 and 50%. Even the lowest end of that is 5x more deadly than the most extreme (3-4%, age adjusted, CDC) estimates of covid. And even then you don't show it in fucking shops, if anywhere you show it at the border.  The deadliness of a disease is NOT the only factor. The rate of spread is very important. Long term post viral syndromes are very important. Covid spreads much more rapidly than yellow fever. Comparing them is absolutely absurd.   Countries with yellow fever likely have rather high vaccine uptake rates as well.  &gt;I know living in a society requires you to surrender freedoms for the sake of other people in the society. So why is the speed limit on roads not a blanket 10 mph? I bet that would reduce car accident fatalities to essentially zero. Because there has to be some kind of compromise and I don't think that the risk of covid justifies the government overreach in this case.  Absurd comparison. Not nearly enough people are injured/dying on the roads to overburden the ambulance services, or fill hospitals to dangerously high occupancy levels. Traffic injuries are not contagious, either.

Not licenced in the same way a vaccine which has undergone long-term studies has.](https://www.pfizer.com/science/coronavirus/vaccine/about-our-landmark-trial)  I am not against the vaccine. It is great that it is working and that uptake is so good. I'm just not risking my health for it. I've already had covid. The IFR and symptomatic presentation of covid drops hugely amongst the vaccinated (IFR will be sub-0.5%) so the risk of anyone catching serious disease from me is miniscule.  So what are the benefits of vaccine passports amongst a largely vaccinated population? How do they outweigh the economic and social downsides of excluding 5-10% of the population from society? What is cost benefit? The government has a track record of screwing things up, this will be no difference. All for a virus with an IFR of sub-0.5%.  The true reasons for bringing in a vaccine passport would be authoritarian and sinister, they are in no way justified in terms of the virus. That said, I'm hoping that they are just a threat to increase uptake.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oqkio1/covid19_govt_reserves_right_to_make_vaccine/h6gfwpy/

1044,605,0,1618768177,"When it comes to Europe’s Covid vaccination rollout, could it be that slow and steady wins the race?  After a lacklustre start to delivering doses around the continent, that is certainly the message European leaders are now sending.  Following a debut marred by delays and a dearth of supplies, the EU’s vaccination drive is finally gathering pace, leading some even to suggest - chief among them President Emmanuel Macron himself - that it could catch up with Britain “in the coming weeks”.  “With all the shots rolling in, it’s even no longer unthinkable that the EU will finish vaccinating its entire adult population ahead of the UK,” claimed Joshua Livestro, member of the Committee on European Integration of the Advisory Council on International Affairs of the Dutch Foreign Ministry.  ""While the UK is likely to finish its vaccination marathon crawling on all fours, the EU will be sprinting toward the tape.”  As the UK reopens, such claims appear wildly exaggerated. Indeed, with the continent still in the grip of a deadly third wave and fresh health concerns over the new Johnson&amp;Johnson jab as well as new variants, the EU is struggling to make headway against the pandemic.  Yet undoubtedly there are encouraging indicators.   European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced this week that the EU administered 100m doses, “a milestone we can be proud of!”. More than a quarter are second shots, meaning more than 27m Europeans are fully vaccinated.  “We are also accelerating the delivery of vaccinations,” she insisted.  The EC chief has set a target of inoculating 75 per cent of the adult population by the end of summer.  EU leaders have also declared that the bloc will soon become the world’s number one producer of vaccines.  With the EU’s nose still out of joint over AstraZeneca delays and its run-in with the UK, Mrs von der Leyen confirmed the bloc would receive 250m doses of Pfizer in the second quarter - some 50m more than expected. Negotiations have begun for a contract of 1.8bn doses over 2021-2023 with all production and raw materials being based on the continent.  Some countries are bounding ahead with jabs. In the Netherlands, the number of daily doses per 100 people shot above the UK rate of 0.64 to reach 0.77 on April 11. With 4m doses administered, the country has now given 21.6 per cent of the adult population a first dose, with 6.1 per cent of the population fully vaccinated.  Lampooned for its early vaccination efforts, France has passed some positive milestones of late.  It is consistently hitting more than 450,000 vaccinations a day after opening the first of 40 mass vaccine centres across the country last week, including at the stade de France, the national stadium. On Friday, it surpassed 12 million first doses - two million higher than its mid-April target - and is easily on track to reach 20 million by mid-May and 30 million the following month.  Ursula von der Leyen received her vaccine a day after the EU passed 100m jabs Ursula von der Leyen received her vaccine a day after the EU passed 100m jabs Some 17.8 per cent of the French population, (and 22.8 per cent of adults), had received one jab with more than six per cent having received two. That is still way behind the UK, which has surpassed 32 million first doses (61.4pc of the population) and eight million second jabs (15.5pc).  To speed things up, France has increased the gap between the two doses of the mRNA jabs, making the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine available to anyone over 55, and rolled out the first 200,000 doses of the Johnson &amp; Johnson product a week early - also available for this age bracket.  Not all milestones are welcome, however. France this week became the eighth country whose death toll surpassed the 100,000-mark. With an average of roughly 300 deaths a day and almost 6,000 people in intensive care - the highest figure since April last year - government spokesman Gabriel Attal warned that “the third wave is not behind us”, nor is its peak.  There are also growing fears about the possible impact of the Brazilian variant, which along with the South African mutation accounts for 4.2 per cent of French cases and prompted it to suspend flights from Brazil this week.  Given such headwinds, it is too early to say whether Mr Macron, who is up for election in 12 months time, can claim to have been right to refuse to lock the country for a third time in January, despite calls from his own scientific advisors.  Germany, where vaccine roll-out has accelerated dramatically since Easter, is in a similar race against time and its ability to get a handle on the virus could also prove key for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party.  On Wednesday, the country set a new national record with 738.501 jabs in a day, compared with 547,465 in the UK on the same day. Some 18.5 per cent of Germans have now had their first jab, compared to just 12 per cent on April 1. Some 6.4 per cent are fully vaccinated.  While bigger deliveries of vaccines have played a role, the decision to involve GPs in the jab campaign has also been key to the newfound speed.    Doctors administered more than 1.1m in their first week alone and are expected to ramp up even further as dose quantities increase. The gear change could see the entire adult population receive a first jab by July 18, two months early and be fully vaccinated by August 8, according to the German Institute for Public Health Insurance (ZI).  A shadow on the horizon is the concern the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine may cause blood clots. Germany has factored the vaccine heavily into its plans — it is expecting an order of 10m jabs — and any decision to limit its use could slow the country’s roll-out.  Meanwhile, in Italy, daily inoculations are hovering above 200,000 new doses administered per day since late last month. Some 9.7m first doses have been administered and 4.1m second ones. Officials have expressed optimism restrictions could be eased soon if the pace of immunisation continues to pick up. That may be premature. On Wednesday, Italy reported another 16,000 new cases in 24 hours and 469 more deaths.  Indeed, the persistently high infection and death rates and hospitalisations threaten to jeopardise plans to relax rules in the coming weeks as Europeans eye Britain’s lockdown exit with envy.  Keen to cajole a country under nationwide semi-confinement and a 7pm to 6am curfew, Mr Macron held talks with the French government on Thursday night on an exit roadmap and his aides hinted that he aimed to progressive reopen cafes and restaurants, along with cultural venues by mid-May. “  “We need some quick wins to raise morale,” fretted junior social economy minister Olivia Grégoire. “(Reopening) terraces is a small victory to brighten our daily lives.”  But ministers have already warned that this is still only “hypothetical”. Mr Macron will address the nation by the end of the month.  Macron has claimed the EU could catch up with Britain “in the coming weeks” With intensive care beds filling up in Germany, Angela Merkel is struggling to push a new law through parliament to take control of lockdown measures out of the hands of the country’s 16 regional governments and impose tough national restrictions for the first time, including night-time curfews for the worst-hit areas. She has already met fierce political resistance from the regions some of who want to go the other way.  As summer beckons, EU countries, including Germany, France and Italy, remain closed to tourism for now.  But some are forging ahead with holiday plans regardless.  Greece intends to open borders on 14 May for all travellers who have been vaccinated or provide a negative coronavirus test. Croatia says it is opening up those who can prove they have had a second doses at least two weeks previously.  Meanwhile, EU governments have reached a common position on plans for digital vaccination certificates, which could eventually pave the way to a vaccine passport system open to Britons hoping to travel to Europe. The EU-only plans must be agreed with MEPs before they can become law, which could be before the end of June.  Mass vaccinations are key to getting European economies back on track.  Last month, the OECD said it expected the UK economy to grow by 5.1 per cent this year and 4.7 per cent in 2022 - a significant increase on its December 2020 estimate. Its EU growth forecast was also increased to 3.9 per cent for 2021 — however, this was a much smaller uplift than elsewhere due to its slow vaccine rollout.  “Reflecting the periodic infection waves and the pace of vaccinations, the economic recovery in Europe is still halting and uneven,"" said Alfred Kammer, director of the International Monetary Fund's European department.  ""We are suggesting an extra push, and an extra effort"" to limit permanent damage to the region's productivity.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/mthmlk/whisper_it_quietly_europes_vaccination_programme/guzo4tb/

If you were born with a health book that tracked your pregnancy, your birth, your well baby checks, your common health conditions that YOU COULD TAKE with you wherever you went it would be an INCREDIBLY useful piece of information for not just yourself but for travel and work particularly if like 5% of the workforce you work for the NHS...  We literally do this for pets. It's absolute insanity that pets have better vaccination records than humans. And you forget. The disease isn't ""live or die"". You forgot option 3.

The only way these passports make sense is to implement them now to allow some industries such as travel and leisure to open up earlier, and people who have been vaccinated to start to get their lives back.   The talk about segregation and discrimination annoys me because it’s not really that different to the tier system that stopped swathes of people doing anything whilst other parts of the country had much greater freedom. If it was acceptable to do that based on science (ie local infection rates), then it should ok to implement passports on the same basis (which is that you are a lower risk to others if you have been vaccinated).  Given the pace of the vaccination roll out most people aren’t going to have to wait that long to get their passport and it could be an incentive for compliance. As long as it’s not implemented for anything essential ie going to work, food shopping, medical appointments, there shouldn’t really be an issue.
