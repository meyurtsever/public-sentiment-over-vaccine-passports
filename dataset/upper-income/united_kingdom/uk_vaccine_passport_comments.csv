I'm against them first and foremostly because they have been proven, by [studies](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/229153/vaccine-passports-linked-covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy/), to *increase* vaccine hesitancy.   COVID-19 vaccines have little (and decreasing) ability to protect against transmission of the virus, but they are able to prevent severe disease and even death. It's extremely important that people get vaccinated, but COVID passports entrench the unvaccinated and may even turn people against getting their boosters. They create a sense that vaccines are being used to control people rather than help them. And even worse - the conduit for the backlash caused by that perception is usually the National Health Service. That, to my mind, is more dangerous than just letting an unvaccinated person into an establishment to spread the virus - something that, whether they're vaccinated or not, would be happening anyway.  [The Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Select Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Administration_and_Constitutional_Affairs_Select_Committee) also published [a report](https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/327/public-administration-and-constitutional-affairs-committee/news/157355/covid-passport-policy-lacks-scientific-evidence-base/) in September 2021 noting that COVID passport policies ack a scientific evidence base. And since then, real world application in similar countries to England like Wales, Scotland, and France have shown that they have little to no effect on viral spread. France has possibly the strictest COVID passport policy in the world and yet they have similar daily case numbers to the UK right now and are in the midst of their second biggest wave - England is in the same position, and we have not had COVID passports until now.  On a personal note: my mum's family are Irish Catholics from Northern Ireland. I have an extreme aversion to segregation. Barring the unvaccinated from participating in society, [especially when so many of them are of an ethnic minority makeup](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(21)00157-5/fulltext), is a bit dodgy to me.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/rgn50a/jeremy_corbyn_votes_against_compulsory_jab_for/homqp79/

You could be there for hours prior to that time but the second it hits 1am you have to show it. What's the sense behind that?  Like all decisions, there are compromises and balances to be achieved. It would be most effective to require everyone to wear a mask at all times, to mandate the type of mask, and so on. But that's not practical, or going to be accepted by the public. They're targetting the rules where they think those rules will be most effective, and trying not to damage the economy any more than necessary in the process.

49,3,1639507254,"As per a report that the cross-party parliamentary Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee published in September...  &gt;Covid passports are being introduced for entry to some venues, including nightclubs and live sporting events, to control the spread of the virus according to the Government. However, new analysis and a lack of evidence provided by the Government in its response to the Committee’s report casts doubt on whether this will work.   &gt;   &gt;\[...\] the latest analysis by Public Health England (PHE) found that although being fully vaccinated protects against infection and severe symptoms, it unlikely to do much to stop the spread of the virus if people become infected. Jabbed and unjabbed individuals carry similar amounts of the virus.   &gt;   &gt;Concerns over viral load of the Delta variant appeared in Sage meeting minutes from 22 July. Sage, the Government’s scientific advisory panel, warned that there is ‘limited vaccine effect against onward transmission’ of the variant. Given that this meeting was held before the Government responded to the Committee’s report, the Committee has severe concerns about the way in which this policy has been developed and kept under consideration.  “We have often heard throughout the pandemic that the Government will follow the science, but when afforded the opportunity to provide it on Covid passports, it has failed to do so. All we have is a flimsy claim that there is a public health case, but without any foundation for the claim to stand on.”  “With recent analysis suggesting that vaccinated people carry as much of the virus as the unvaccinated into any setting, the disappointing lack of any scientific basis for the Government’s decision to go ahead could reasonably lead people to conclude that there is in fact no such basis. If the real goal is to drive vaccine uptake, then it is a deeply cynical approach that will be counterproductive.”  “Following through on such a costly, discriminatory and, potentially, ineffective policy will have consequences for trust in and acceptance of the Government’s measures to tackle the pandemic. It’s surely either time to prove how this’ll work or to put an end to it.”  Or let's just take a look at France, who have a similarly sized population as the UK *and* an incredibly strict COVID passport programme, and currently have a 7 day case average of +48,000 - not dissimilar to the UK's +51,000 7 day case average.  They do not fucking work, and the Wikipedia article you linked is talking about quarantine certificates, not COVID passports.  &gt;the public health measures being mandated are neither oppressive nor authoritarian  I'm sure the people present at Sarah Everard's wake, the Kill The Bill protestors who got their faces fucking smashed in with riot shields because they were 'violating COVID-19 restrictions', the university students who had the police pin them into their accommodation blocks, etc. would agree with you.  You can harp on about how I'm on the wrong side of history if you want. We'll see what happens when the unvaccinated, who already map directly onto a map of people who hate authority, get to position medical agencies as an 'other' to fight because they're being threatened with social exclusion to get vaccines they don't trust, by a government they don't trust and don't believe are acting in their best interests, every six months.  &gt;Facts.   &gt;   &gt;Don't.   &gt;   &gt;Care.   &gt;   &gt;About.   &gt;   &gt;Your.   &gt;   &gt;Feelings.

Uh... look i think that guy is a prat, and I agree that the measures being proposed are good and necessary (and not going far enough: a lockdown would probably bankrupt me and is probably necessary) however there is a legitimate fear that these measures, created in a time of national emergency, might get extended or simply not leave at the end.

As background, I'm a bartender in Calgary, Alberta, a very conservative province, with a scientific background (job market sucks here) I scan peoples' vaccine QR codes daily. A second note: vaccine passports in Alberta are for pubs, restaurants, clubs, cinemas/theatre, and any sporting event (indoor or outdoor). Supermarkets, clothing stores, liquor stores, ect cannot ask for proof of vaccination.  I get the aversion to being ID'd to get in to place on medical grounds, I was initially very against it. But we hit our 4th wave in Ab very fast and very hard. It is a comfort to me if I am in a crowded bar that I know every single person there is double vaccinated, including staff.  Now, we have all shown our drivers licence to be served in a pub, even if it was X years ago. From my experience as a frequent pub-goer and barman, there is only 1 extra step now (in Alberta): I have an app on my phone that will scan a QR code in less than a second. If you are vaccinated, I get a name, date of birth, and a big green tick. That is all. If you are not vaccinated, I get a name, date of birth, and a big red X. I cross check the name and DoB with a photo ID (licence, passport, ect). I get no other info. I cannot access any other info, the app doesn't allow it. If the info checks out, get in the bar and drink to your hearts content. If not, you have to leave.  In regards to personal health information, vaccination status is less personal, but more societal. We all get vaccines to protect those who cannot. As someone who scans vaccine ID's daily, I don't see any info, I also don't care, just order drinks. For the measures we use, there is no way to access medical info.   I agree on the govt fucking it up, though. But I also have an incompetent govt and they did it well. In the end (we initially had PDF files...that weren't locked and easily edited. Then moved to QR code only) The NHS organised the entire vaccine rollout incredibly well with minimal govt interference - maybe they could also deal with any vaccine passporting?   With regards to personal liberties...yeah you do have a say with what you put in to your body, I won't advocate forcing people to get a vaccine they don't want. But you have no right to enter a business and infect other people. You can do what you want but pubs and restaurants are private businesses, if they refuse to serve someone based on vaccine status, it is their right. That is how it works here - pubs and restaurants do not have to check vaccine status - but if they do not, they can only operate patios and beer gardens. It can get to -30 here so, most opted in.  Vaccination rates shot up when this was announced - went from 6000 1st doses to 16,000 1st doses in 24 hours. Turns out, people care way a lot about being able to drink in a bar. Stats linked below  TL;DR I don't like vaccine passports, but I feel so much safer and relaxed with them.

From September 13-17 no stories on the UK-wide news programme featured negative framing of the Westminster Government, research by The National found.  During the same period, Reporting Scotland ran 10 stories about the Scottish Government with a negative framing.  The disparity was identified as political stories on both the News at Six and Reporting Scotland were recorded each evening and categorised based on whether they featured a positive, negative or neutral framing of each government. Negative framing typically includes someone being “accused” of something or forced to “defend” an action.   The News at Six mainly featured stories that were neutral towards the UK Government, with 17 of the total 24 political stories using this framing. There was also one positively framed story about the UK Government, one neutral package about the Scottish Government and one negatively framed segment on Holyrood.  Meanwhile Reporting Scotland featured just six neutrally framed stories about the SNP government, compared to 10 negative ones. Every UK Government story was framed in a neutral light, and there was just one positive Scottish Government piece.  It is the third time this year The National has carried out the research, and the third time Reporting Scotland has been noticeably more critical of Holyrood than the News at Six has been of Westminster.  Rona Mackay (below), SNP MSP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, criticised the BBC over the findings.  “The BBC is mandated to ‘due impartiality in all its output’ – but they are failing to deliver on their own editorial guidelines,” she told The National.  “It is hard to believe Reporting Scotland and its sensationalist reporting are from the same organisation as the too-often acquiescent BBC News at Six.  “BBC bosses needs to explain to audiences the gross disparity in their editorial treatment between north and south of the Border.”  Most stories with a negative framing of the Scottish Government focused on health last week, with stories covering high ambulance response times, increased Covid-19 deaths, hospitality groups’ criticism of vaccine passport plans and a technical issue preventing full reporting of daily coronavirus figures.  Health stories on the News at Six, however, were presented to viewers through a neutral lens despite touching on similar themes of Covid-19 and planning to see the NHS through a difficult winter.  The 17 neutral stories also included coverage of the Westminster debate on cutting Universal Credit, a move which could push 800,000 people into poverty, according to research from the Legatum Institute think tank.  A spokesperson for the BBC said: “Journalists across the BBC always strive for fairness, accuracy and impartiality in their reporting of news stories for our audiences across all our platforms.”  The new research has been revealed after the Scottish Government hit back at Scottish Tory claims that ministers had put up a “wall of silence” over problems facing the NHS and ambulance service.  At the weekend, BBC Scotland interviewed Tory MSP and GP Sandesh Gulhane – with presenter Martin Geissler saying Humza Yousaf and Jason Leitch had refused to appear on the Sunday Show.  A spokesperson for the Holyrood Government said the Conservatives’ claims were “false”.  “Government and ministers have been working around the clock and will continue doing so to keep the public informed and to support the NHS through the exceptional and unique pressures it is facing due to the global pandemic,” they said.  “Ministers and clinicians have spoken to the media almost every day last week – the Health Secretary was interviewed on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and today [Sunday], the First Minister addressed Parliament on Thursday and the national clinical director was interviewed on Thursday and Friday.”",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/puepr3/bbcs_lack_of_tory_scrutiny_is_failing_viewers/he2cp4g/

My prediction, the government will reverse course on vaccine mandates to get the rate higher because that's politically less damaging than having to go back into lockdowns.

We are only making 24'000 doses a day. The campaign is stuck, and most of the remaining people won't get the vaccine whatsoever.  Yet, 90% may not be sufficient to prevent a public health crisis in case a new wave or variant comes. Even more as vaccines lose a bit of efficacy, and some people may be against getting a third dose.  Again, not getting vaccinated against such an infectious and sufficiently lethal disease has widespread effects on the society as a whole, and not just one's own health. If you want to keep this choice personal by not introducing a mandate, you need to curb on the public health effects by not allowing unvaxxed people into high-risk events.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ppyd78/bbc_news_covid_vaccine_and_test_passes_to_be/hd84zuj/
173,6,1631899650,"It doesn’t create an incentive, it effectively mandates it if you need one to do anything to be involved with society. Which is the entire ethical problem currently being debated here. It creates a two tier system in society which further increases discrimination. It is widely accepted among experts that mandating, whether through direct law or through covert means like this, hinders the uptake of the vaccine - something you are advocating for, more uptake.  Like I’ve said, why do you need a passport if the majority of the population is vaccinated? Naturally, the risk is reduced by an order of magnitude for everyone.   If a new variant arises, which is actually quite likely, the passports mean nothing. They are inconsequential in stopping this from getting any worse or better. It’s just more control and more surveillance for the government, which as history shows us, is never ever, a good thing.  And it shouldn’t be in widespread use, this is a good thing.  I’m afraid it’s not as clean cut as you make out. Age and medical data are completely leagues apart from one another. I work with complex data on a daily basis and medical information is up there as one of the most sensitive classifications of data a person has about themselves. I’ve never had to enter a pub and provide proof of any other vaccination because it is absolutely no one else’s business and never ever should be, unless in an appropriate setting I.e. a conversation with your doctor who is bound by many many laws and codes to keep this data safe.  Showing proof of age is acceptable because it’s not very sensitive data... You can at least deduct just through visuals how old someone is, that’s why not everyone gets ID checked at a club or for buying alcohol in a supermarket.  The point you are missing is if this allowed to happen en-masse and becomes the norm, they will be able to mandate anything. Personal freedom and choice is something we should never ever ever take for granted because once it’s gone, it’s seriously fucking hard to get back.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ppyd78/bbc_news_covid_vaccine_and_test_passes_to_be/hd8bl4p/
174,7,1631902187,"&gt;It doesn’t create an incentive, it effectively mandates it if you need one to do anything to be involved with society  No, it doesn't. You can still test or avoid going to places. A mandate means that if you are not vaccinated, you get fined heavily if you don't vaccinate your children your parental rule can be overridden by public health officials, and so on.  For example, passports are not mandatory. However, if you don't have one you can't go to places. Blood tests are not mandatory, nor are condoms, but if you don't test and you have unprotected sex you can't donate blood. And so on. Vaccination won't be mandatory, but if you don't get vaccinated nor want to test with the free LFTs... well, you won't be able to go to places. Easy.  &gt;Like I’ve said, why do you need a passport if the majority of the population is vaccinated?  The ""majority"" of the population is vaccinated also in the US. However, you can see how several states are saturating their hospitals despite it being summer (so people spending more time outdoor). Is the 89% in the UK enough to prevent hospitals from getting full? In case of a strong wave, even without a new variation probably not. Full hospitals mean postponing other types of healthcare, putting other hospital patients at risk etc...  &gt;I work with complex data on a daily basis  Me too. So you should know that one of the things that can make such a system acceptable is a simple rule of not storing the data and not showing the reason of your pass. People will know you have the passport, but not why. It could be due to testing or vaccination. Or exemption. Or whatever other reason. You won't be able to tell novaxxers from vaxxed people, exempt from vaxxed, and exempt from novaxxers. The only thing you will get to know is that that person is either vaccinated or does not have covid, and thus is allowed to enter a venue (if they had covid and knew it, they should be barred anyway as by law).  &gt;The point you are missing is if this allowed to happen en-masse and becomes the norm, they will be able to mandate anything. Personal freedom and choice is something we should never ever ever take for granted because once it’s gone, it’s seriously fucking hard to get back.  Again, this is a legitimate argument. I may agree for the UK more than for other countries (due to the common law system and lack of a proper Constitution), but the other arguments do not make any sense. I have told you what is the point of passports (avoid clogging up hospitals), that they already exist and are based on a fully functional system (no need to spend money, just open your NHS app and you'll find your pass), and that this does not reveal any information regarding your health record (you have clearly never opened your NHS domestic covid pass, have't you?), nor your ""checks"" get stored.  Even the legitimate concern that mandatory vaccines may reduce uptake may be true under certain circumstances, but not in general. For example, a mandatory covid vaccine may reduce public confidence in the institutions for the future, but I would expect the covid vaccination rate to go up, and fast. It happened in France and Italy. Again, Italy recently had to introduce harsh vaccine mandates and strengthen their enforcement as a lot of people just stopped vaccinating their children against deadly diseases due to fake news and social media resonance chambers, with vaccination rates for some of the ""normal"" vaccines dropping to 85-90%. After the mandate was introduced a few years ago, vaccination rates are up a gain to close to 100%.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/ppyd78/bbc_news_covid_vaccine_and_test_passes_to_be/hd8hmos/
175,8,1631905772,"Currently, I agree with you on the mandated, it isn’t. However, my concern is that it isn’t financial consequences, it’s the discrimination and societal pressures that have consequences on people. Purely anecdotal, but my brother has PTSD and for that reason couldn’t wear a mask, it triggered him and he was regularly met with abuse because he wasn’t wearing a mask in a public setting. It’s these people I’m trying to defend and introducing measures like vaccine passports has wide reaching consequences that I just don’t think you are willing to even entertain or admit they are real.  I could probably align with you if the vaccine stopped all transmission and was a silver bullet to stop covid altogether - but it isn’t. We are told almost every winter the NHS is due to collapse due to the flu (again, I’m not an idiot, covid is more serious than the flu, but the main point stands, we don’t require a passport for other transmissible diseases which supposedly bring the NHS to its knees every winter) so why would give up liberties for this? Why would we prevent people from being active members of a society? If someone is clinically unable to have a vaccine, no amount of testing or passports is going to protect them, thus making the entire idea useless, the only use would be handing over control to the government for artificial purposes.  Travel passports are completely different. I do not need one domestically to enter a pub or a venue, unless it’s being used for ID purposes in place of a driving license or any other officially recognised ID, which is a completely different context to the one in which you referred to.  Abstracting data away or down to a yes or no or other simplified context does not decrease the sensitivity of the data when used in a personal context, that’s why we have things like password fields on login forms, the data is abstracted from view, but is still sensitive. Vaccination data or health data in general is sensitive, which is why we have super strict laws to keep it that way. The idea of having a passport doesn’t work in practise also. Who decides the validity of the passport? What system does it get checked against? A centralised government database? Government systems are generally shite and outdated and couldn’t cope with a nationalised rollout on such scale and demand. What would the infrastructure look like to enable this? Every single enclosed space in the country would need some kind of validation system to make sure it was all correct or the effectiveness of the passport system is essentially non-existent. It’s all good showing a phone screen or piece of paper but can it actually be verified? In this case the data you refer to has absolutely no integrity, therefore making it absolutely useless to do anything with. I have opened the app tbh, it’d be incredibly easy to take a screenshot and doctor it, hence the need for validation infrastructure, which I wouldn’t trust our government to implement in a month of Sunday’s given how poorly designed and poorly engineered the test and trace app was.  The whole point of the vaccine is to stop clogging up hospitals, if a tiny proportion of the population (I think your over exaggerating how many people are genuine anti-vaxxers) don’t get vaccinated it will be negligible on terms of the overall outcome, especially considering that people who have the vaccine can also still be hospitalised, again the vaccine does not eliminate covid.  The UK government are renowned for the “surveillance state”, this is no untruth. If you work with data like you say, you will understand how much the government are hell bent in knowing where we are, who we’re with and so on. This concern that “giving an inch and they will take a mile” is not unfounded, if we let me mandate things like this, it’ll be a hell of a lot easier to mandate more intrusive things in the future. I can almost say with certainty that most of the powers granted to the government in the COVID Act as temporary measures will remain in law.  So better education and combating fake news seems like a better alternative to increase uptake in any vaccine, as most experts do agree.   A vaccine passport is not necessary at all, if people are vaccinated, which the majority are, the risk in the NHS collapsing is reduced by an order of magnitude. It’s widely impractical in my opinion and I’m a strong advocate for peoples privacy, personal data, personal responsibility and personal choice. I also don’t believe everyone who opts out of having the vaccine is a raging lunatic that succumbed to fake news, it’s just simply their choice and they shouldn’t be excluded from society, they should still have the same rights as anyone else.  I don’t think we’ll agree and that is completely fine, we don’t have to agree that’s beauty of personal freedom!

Not needing a license would mean that anybody could do it, with zero training, resulting in absolute carnage.  A vaccine passport proves that you've had a jab. That jab doesn't stop you catching it\* or spreading it, but it lessens your symptoms if you do get it. That benefit is solely enjoyed by the vaccinated, so banning unvaccinated from somewhere could only be beneficial if done in order to protect the unvaccinated. But if that is the case, then why not also ban anyone obese or elderly, because even with vaccines their risk factors are higher. The only reason would be to improve vaccine uptake. If it turned out driving licenses were required to enter a supermarket just in order to boost driving lesson uptake, would that be OK with you?  Moreover, I don't believe it is healthy for a society to demand proof of your medical status before allowing you to live your life. I just don't. Agree to disagree if you feel otherwise.  \**Yes, I know it reduces the chances of catching it, but at what appears to be a reducing rate from the moment of vaccination. Vaccine immunity has been shown to be worse than natural immunity, with breakthrough infections common, meaning the chances are most people will catch the virus sooner or later, with the vaccinated having an easier time dealing with it. Therefore, the vaccine is more likely to delay infection than prevent it entirely.*  Would you support bicycle licenses? If not, why not?

311,6,1630264963,"&gt;The data simply does not support this belief.   Yep, vaccine acceptance is pretty high, but there's nothing wrong with aiming to have higher acceptance than 88%. Every extra person who uses the relatively small resources to get vaccinated reduces strain on our health system. And since you like anecdotes so much, I suggest you look at some of the comments from medical professionals on here about their feelings on this. Or here's a wider survey if you don't want to listen to random people on the internet https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/226513/many-icu-staff-have-experienced-mental/  &gt; but it would be far cheaper and easier to offer a £100 payment to each fully vaccinated young adult   Yeah, I'm not against that idea. Sounds fine to me. But I see no issue with having it alongside vaccine passports.  &gt;**3) Vaccine passports ignore natural immunity due to prior infection**  &gt;There is now a good body of evidence showing that recovery from prior infection offers strong protection against re-infection. Freaking out about 34% of young adults being unvaccinated ignores the fact that a substantial portion of them will already have protection (90% of 30-year-olds were found to already have antibodies against Covid). If there truly is a concern about unvaccinated young people,   &gt; surely the problem will solve itself quickly as they get infected by and recover from Covid.   People don't just 'recover from covid'. They put an entirely unnecessary burden on our healthcare system. It seems you have very little empathy for the people working hard to save idiots who don't give a damn about others.  &gt;  by now everyone choosing to remain unvaccinated is willingly taking that risk.  There are plenty of people who are simply apathetic to it. The portion of diehard antivaxxers is quite small.   https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1138  Plenty of people are open to putting in the effort to get one.  &gt;The argument that the unvaccinated pose a threat to the vaccinated does not stack up. While vaccines offer strong protection against serious illness or death from Covid, the most recent data emerging from highly vaccinated countries (such as Israel or Gibraltar) shows that vaccines are less effective at preventing infection.  Which studies are you referring to? Because from what I can see, the evidence is quite clear that vaccines reduce the spread of infection  https://www.bmj.com/content/372/bmj.n338  &gt;Once pubs and other venues are forced to implement a mechanism for checking everyone’s vaccine passports on entry,  Who said pubs should be forced to do this? I've never argued that.  &gt; it will become trivially easy to expand the system to advance other social objectives, and transform Britain into a “papers, please” society.   Well, I agree that pubs shouldn't be forced to do this, but I don't think it would be any worse than requiring pubs to stop smoking indoors, or telling people to wear seatbelts in their own car. What a lot of people don't seem to understand is that we have a social healthcare system. It costs people resources to look after others who harm themselves unnecessarily.  &gt; What about banning criminals and other social undesirables? Once it’s normal for pubs, why not roll it out to all public venues?  That's nonsense. The point of our justice system is rehabilitation. Criminals are not 'social undesirables', assuming that our justice system is working remotely well.  &gt; Not because I'm against flu jabs, but because I have never needed one.   Getting a flu jab isn't just for you. You seem to be one of those people who doesn't really grasp that vaccines are not just for the person receiving them. Some nice info from the CDC here:  https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/misconceptions.htm  &gt;The sad thing is that you *talk* like a government official even though you aren't one.   Indeed I am not. I am quite critical of this government and think it's one of the worst the UK has seen in a century. My stance on this issue is the same regardless of what the government holds as a stance.

Of course not. It should be properly considered and debated.  I gave you some examples of reasons why we shouldn't have them.  However, I feel that those who want them should be the ones to convince everyone else why they are a good idea, why they would benefit everyone.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;What does a mask have to do with vaccines? Your thinking seems a bit fuzzy.  What I was trying to say was that a vaccine passport would mean that you would need something to prove you have had a vaccine, whether this is on your phone or some form of physical identity card.  Something you can easily forget, thus making life more difficult for people than it really needs to be,   Yes, I admit this wasn't well thought out. ;)  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;We can't dictate policy by whatever stupidity conspiracy theorists will cook up.

To me, vaccine passports are just a backdoor way to try and do this.  Something which I really think is a dangerous situation to be in.  Medical intervention has always been an individuals decision.  We have never had enforcement on any other vaccine, and although we are in a middle of a pandemic, the onus should be on the government to convince people into having the vaccine and not to punish people into it.  &amp;#x200B;  &gt;How so?

324,1,1630004729,"&gt; However, I feel that those who want them should be the ones to convince everyone else why they are a good idea, why they would benefit everyone.  Simply put, if a vaccine means that someone has less chance of transmitting a potentially fatal virus, it is of interest to people whether someone they are in contact with is vaccinated. Vaccine passports are merely official documentation for that.  You seem to be persisting with the strawman that somehow vaccine passports do not account for people who cannot receive a vaccine, yet of course, they do. The few situations where they have been rolled out recently also account for people who haven't had the vaccine, but have actually been ill with the virus.  &gt; at the moment the majority of people who will have a vaccine have probably already had one by now.  Some people take more convincing than others. This is quite natural, and we shouldn't give up at the first sign of difficulty.  &gt; The people who you now have to convince are those conspiracy theorists and those who are reluctant to for whatever reason.  Fortunately not. There are still plenty of people who are simply uninformed or apathetic, I know some of them in person.  &gt; Punishing them into getting a vaccine, by restricting their freedoms   You're back on the strawman arguments - where did anyone say a vaccine passport is restricting freedoms? If you mean that certain situations will limit access based upon vaccination status, isn't that entirely reasonable? For example, working at a care home? It's entirely standard to limit access to certain elements of society well before covid was a thing. You need a pilots license to fly a plane for example, but are you complaining that other people's freedoms have been restricted? Some people would certainly make that argument, but I dare say it's a pretty bad one.   The reason we don't let just anyone fly planes is that it can cause damage to other people - it's the same with someone wanting to be unvaccinated. They're perfectly entitled to remain unvaccinated, but they won't have access to situations where they can harm others through their decision.  I suppose you will also argue that it's unreasonable to have laws restricting guns and knives in the UK? This is very much an argument in some countries. Fortunately, the 'muh freedoms' argument doesn't tend to go very far in the UK, perhaps because we are simply a lot more cramped together.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/pa12mw/antivaxx_protesters_force_their_way_into_itns/hagkxbi/

All it really does is increase your body's ability to fight the virus which means your symptoms are less severe and you time to beat the virus is shorter. You might cough and sneeze less, but you still cough and sneeze.     I think the vaccine passport was used because a) the governments prime focus is to keep NHS ICU populations under control, and with the vaccine you are much less likely to need the ICU. So they dont care if you keep spreading the virus. As long as you are not in danger of taking up a bed. And b) It is thought that the reduction of transmission (not prevention) is just enough to beat the virus but have an acceptable circumstance in which we return to normal society. Ie we kill more virus parts than produce them. I am not fully convinced we reached that stage, but it could be possible if the vaccine means we are less likely to be coughing and sneezing over each other and surfaces.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/p79nf9/jabbed_adults_infected_with_delta_can_match_virus/h9infrt/

344,1,1629185017,"It's not a false equivalence.  Not every comparison is an equivalence; it’s possible to compare things without suggesting that they are equal to one another.  Both scenarios a driving license and a vaccine passport, are Authoritarian measures where you require to go through a process and obtain some sort of identity card in order to make use of a service.  Both are done with the aim of protecting public health.  That's why the comparison is brought up, you may find one of these authoritarian measures more reasonable than the other and you may in fact have a point, but the problem here is no one who is bringing up a drivers license in regards to peoples opposition to vaccine passports is saying they are of equal value.  This is always in response to statements that the measures are ""Authoritarian"" or ""coercion"".  And they definitely are, but again so are many things in society like a drivers license.  So the point stands, there are instances of coercion and authoritarianism in our society that we accept and agree with because the consequences outweigh the benefits.  So complaining about ""it's coercion"" just isn't good enough, it requires more to counter it.  If ""it's coercion"" or ""it's authoritarian"" is all that was needed to dismiss something as a bad thing then drivers licenses absolutely would fall under that too.  But in regards to fallacies:  &gt; If you really think that it won't be permanent then I've got a bridge to sell you.  This is absolutely a slippery slope.  And it's constantly brought up on this issue.  It seems impossible to argue against the measure in its current form, some bogeyman needs to be created to argue against instead.

He called the proceedings ""preposterous"" and ""disgusting"".  &gt; His supporters filled the courtroom, with one woman repeatedly laughing and another clapping loudly when Glynn slammed Singapore's judiciary. Court officers stepped in to stop them at various points.  &gt; Thursday was meant to be Glynn's first day of trial, but he insisted he would not be pleading guilty or not guilty as it was ""nonsense"".  &gt; The hearing opened with Glynn trying to introduce his legal counsel, a Mr Abdul Rashid Abdul Rahman. He had appeared in court with Glynn previously, but was stopped at the door for improper attire.  &gt; Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh told the court that the prosecution had performed their checks and confirmed that Mr Abdul Rashid was not an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore.  &gt; Mr Abdul Rashid said he is not, but that he is an ""ambassador at large and advocate of Kingdom Filipina Hacienda"", and that he was there to defend his ""sovereign compatriot"".  &gt; He said he understood the meaning of the bar, but said ""I don't need a licence to practice"".  &gt; Mr Koh told the court that the prosecution would be making an application for Glynn to be assessed at IMH, to see if he is of unsound mind.  &gt; **FAMILY AND FRIENDS SENT LETTER ON GLYNN'S BEHAVIOUR**  &gt; ""Prosecution has received a letter from the accused's family and friends or persons purporting to be his family and friends and in this letter, the persons report a marked change of behaviour in the accused's person that was noticeable especially after the COVID restrictions set in,"" he said.  &gt; Given this new information, as well as Glynn's behaviour in court and previous hearings and his choice of counsel, the prosecution said it would be ""prudent"" to assess Glynn to ensure he is of sound mind and capable of making his defence.  &gt; Glynn interrupted at multiple points. He told District Judge Eddy Tham: ""I assure you my mind is very sound. Every time I ask you hard questions, you can't answer me, you shoot me down. What law have I broken? I asked you three times the last time, you gave me silence, silence, silence.""  &gt; He added that he was ""wide awake"", ""enlightened"" and researched ""everything"" but believes nothing.  &gt; When Mr Koh added that Glynn's family members have reported his ""increasing hostility"" towards them, Glynn interjected: ""The certificate of vaccine regulations do not apply to the living man and I'm well aware of this fact.""  &gt; ""Why have the mask regulations been dropped all over American and Europe? Because they are unconstitutional. I don't get my information from the Straits Times.""  &gt; He asked if the prosecutor had seen his ""sovereign ID"", adding that he felt like ""a PhD law lecturer dealing with a GCE law student"".  &gt; He claimed that the police ""kidnapped and abducted"" him on his daughter's birthday, arresting him a second time at his hotel.  &gt; ""I hid in the bathroom and I said - I do not consent, I do not comply. They dragged me out of the shower and handcuffed me. I asked them what crime am I accused of committing. Silence,"" Glynn continued.  &gt; He claimed he spent 18 days ""being tortured in Changi Prison"".  &gt; ""What kind of justice is this, this is preposterous, and the torts against either living man that have been done against me include two unlawful arrests, two false imprisonments, two trespasses against me. They've stolen my passport, my God-given right to travel,"" he said.  &gt; He added that he understood the law ""better than anyone you've ever dealt with before"" and demanded to be released and sent back to England with his family, ""and let's not have a big fuss and scene over this"".  &gt; He continued that his defence is ""very solid and water-tight"" and that the prosecutor ""has no control over my legal fiction"".  &gt; ""I will never plead guilty or not guilty. I can't believe this has been going on since the 8th of May,"" Glynn said.  &gt; ""It's so straightforward it's so clear that this sham of a case should be dropped.""  &gt; A woman in the public gallery burst out laughing soon after this, and another woman waved two thumbs up at Glynn.  &gt; Judge Tham ordered Glynn to be remanded at IMH for two weeks and return to court on Aug 19.  &gt; At this, Glynn raised his voice, saying this is ""absolutely outrageous injustice"".  &gt; ""I am disgusted. How can you send an innocent man to prison when he has not been found guilty and the charges do not apply to him ... I am disgusted at how the Singapore judicial system has treated me and my family,"" he said.  &gt; The woman who had raised her thumbs at Glynn clapped very loudly at this point, and the judge reminded her to observe court decorum.  &gt; As proceedings wound down, Glynn called to the prosecutor: ""Good luck getting into the book of life, Mr Koh. Good luck with that one. How can you say Singapore is a safe country. Police who hunt me down like a pack of wild animals. This is not justice. This is disgusting. I am appalled.""  &gt; He added that he would be ""seeking lawful remedy"".  &gt; Glynn will be taken back to court in two weeks.

Please spare me the comparison with driving licenses or yellow fever certificates.  &amp;#x200B;  I'm tempted to say ""Fine, I'll get this vaccine but then I'm done"" but I know full well that when this passport/certificate is brought in, booster shots can be put on there and now I've bought into a system where my previous 2 jabs were for nout if I haven't had the latest booster. That's not even unlikely, seeing as they're already talking about booster jabs for the vulnerable this autumn, and initially they were considering only vaccinating the vulnerable full stop. It may not happen yet, but there'll inevitably by a variant that crops up that ""requires"" the latest booster, or it will become apparent that immunity wanes significantly over time. Only anti-vaxxers would only have 2 doses, right? And so the cycle continues.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/oru8ci/unjabbed_students_face_ban_as_boris_johnson/h6ktj3f/
378,1,1627310003,"I have two big issues with them. One specific, one general.  The specific issue is that I am against the implementation as a digital ID tied to our complete medical history and other databases and able to be varied centrally without user input. On a basic level, the way they are implemented means the administrator of the system could simply change the data in the ID to indicate that you are not vaccinated and you would be immediately banned from anywhere that requires your vaccine passport. There’s no way to protest or appeal this. People just assume that the id status is correct. The manner of implementation also makes them very easy to add further things like banning orders, driving bans etc Then, because they can be updated remotely, it allows the authorities to effectively ban you from places remotely and without your authority. The example I give is that it is quite possible to tweak the system so that if you are spotted at a demonstration causing a nuisance (set to be made illegal) you could then have your digital ID instantly and remotely modified to set you as “unauthorised” person and de facto ban you from society. Again there appears to be no good way to appeal or change this.  The more general issue is that they would provide an infectious vaccinated person with more rights than an unvaccinated person who can prove they are not infectious. If you had to prove you are not infectious *and* vaccinated then this objection would fall away.

Presumably you might say that banks would have checks and balances which could verify the authenticity of the data at any point and look for changes, but that same thing could be implemented for vaccine data too, and even in an immutable way. Those are all problems that have been solved.  I would also add, but only as a minor objection, that in general, nobody is going to change your vaccination status to ban you from the pub. If they wanted to do that they would change the land register to kick you out of your house, revoke your driving licence to stop you driving, and add a warrant for your arrest for a charge they invent for a crime you didn’t commit.

390,3,1627238514,"&gt;Is the vaccine working exactly as anticipated? There are fairly hefty side effects, one of the reasons other mRNA experiments have never got past primary testing. I won't muddy the waters with anecdotal evidence as we both know it's not really admissable in this sort of discussion, but recorded side effects are, and they are not to be ignored (pleurisy, myocarditis, etc etc).  Now I can see you're arguing in bad faith, because the side effect profile of hese vaccines is extremely low. Far lower than the vast, vast majority of medicines out there. People get irrationally hung up on vaccine side effects.  &gt;As I say, I'm far from an anti-vaxxer, I'm a veritable pin cushion from growing up in the West and then travelling around the world. In fact, I may be rare in this discussion in that I already have a vaccine passport: for yellow fever, a disease with a death rate of between 15 and 50%. Even the lowest end of that is 5x more deadly than the most extreme (3-4%, age adjusted, CDC) estimates of covid. And even then you don't show it in fucking shops, if anywhere you show it at the border.  The deadliness of a disease is NOT the only factor. The rate of spread is very important. Long term post viral syndromes are very important. Covid spreads much more rapidly than yellow fever. Comparing them is absolutely absurd.   Countries with yellow fever likely have rather high vaccine uptake rates as well.  &gt;I know living in a society requires you to surrender freedoms for the sake of other people in the society. So why is the speed limit on roads not a blanket 10 mph? I bet that would reduce car accident fatalities to essentially zero. Because there has to be some kind of compromise and I don't think that the risk of covid justifies the government overreach in this case.  Absurd comparison. Not nearly enough people are injured/dying on the roads to overburden the ambulance services, or fill hospitals to dangerously high occupancy levels. Traffic injuries are not contagious, either.

The IFR and symptomatic presentation of covid drops hugely amongst the vaccinated (IFR will be sub-0.5%) so the risk of anyone catching serious disease from me is miniscule.

What is cost benefit? The government has a track record of screwing things up, this will be no difference. All for a virus with an IFR of sub-0.5%.

605,0,1618768177,"When it comes to Europe’s Covid vaccination rollout, could it be that slow and steady wins the race?  After a lacklustre start to delivering doses around the continent, that is certainly the message European leaders are now sending.  Following a debut marred by delays and a dearth of supplies, the EU’s vaccination drive is finally gathering pace, leading some even to suggest - chief among them President Emmanuel Macron himself - that it could catch up with Britain “in the coming weeks”.  “With all the shots rolling in, it’s even no longer unthinkable that the EU will finish vaccinating its entire adult population ahead of the UK,” claimed Joshua Livestro, member of the Committee on European Integration of the Advisory Council on International Affairs of the Dutch Foreign Ministry.  ""While the UK is likely to finish its vaccination marathon crawling on all fours, the EU will be sprinting toward the tape.”  As the UK reopens, such claims appear wildly exaggerated. Indeed, with the continent still in the grip of a deadly third wave and fresh health concerns over the new Johnson&amp;Johnson jab as well as new variants, the EU is struggling to make headway against the pandemic.  Yet undoubtedly there are encouraging indicators.   European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced this week that the EU administered 100m doses, “a milestone we can be proud of!”. More than a quarter are second shots, meaning more than 27m Europeans are fully vaccinated.  “We are also accelerating the delivery of vaccinations,” she insisted.  The EC chief has set a target of inoculating 75 per cent of the adult population by the end of summer.  EU leaders have also declared that the bloc will soon become the world’s number one producer of vaccines.  With the EU’s nose still out of joint over AstraZeneca delays and its run-in with the UK, Mrs von der Leyen confirmed the bloc would receive 250m doses of Pfizer in the second quarter - some 50m more than expected. Negotiations have begun for a contract of 1.8bn doses over 2021-2023 with all production and raw materials being based on the continent.  Some countries are bounding ahead with jabs. In the Netherlands, the number of daily doses per 100 people shot above the UK rate of 0.64 to reach 0.77 on April 11. With 4m doses administered, the country has now given 21.6 per cent of the adult population a first dose, with 6.1 per cent of the population fully vaccinated.  Lampooned for its early vaccination efforts, France has passed some positive milestones of late.  It is consistently hitting more than 450,000 vaccinations a day after opening the first of 40 mass vaccine centres across the country last week, including at the stade de France, the national stadium. On Friday, it surpassed 12 million first doses - two million higher than its mid-April target - and is easily on track to reach 20 million by mid-May and 30 million the following month.  Ursula von der Leyen received her vaccine a day after the EU passed 100m jabs Ursula von der Leyen received her vaccine a day after the EU passed 100m jabs Some 17.8 per cent of the French population, (and 22.8 per cent of adults), had received one jab with more than six per cent having received two. That is still way behind the UK, which has surpassed 32 million first doses (61.4pc of the population) and eight million second jabs (15.5pc).  To speed things up, France has increased the gap between the two doses of the mRNA jabs, making the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine available to anyone over 55, and rolled out the first 200,000 doses of the Johnson &amp; Johnson product a week early - also available for this age bracket.  Not all milestones are welcome, however. France this week became the eighth country whose death toll surpassed the 100,000-mark. With an average of roughly 300 deaths a day and almost 6,000 people in intensive care - the highest figure since April last year - government spokesman Gabriel Attal warned that “the third wave is not behind us”, nor is its peak.  There are also growing fears about the possible impact of the Brazilian variant, which along with the South African mutation accounts for 4.2 per cent of French cases and prompted it to suspend flights from Brazil this week.  Given such headwinds, it is too early to say whether Mr Macron, who is up for election in 12 months time, can claim to have been right to refuse to lock the country for a third time in January, despite calls from his own scientific advisors.  Germany, where vaccine roll-out has accelerated dramatically since Easter, is in a similar race against time and its ability to get a handle on the virus could also prove key for Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party.  On Wednesday, the country set a new national record with 738.501 jabs in a day, compared with 547,465 in the UK on the same day. Some 18.5 per cent of Germans have now had their first jab, compared to just 12 per cent on April 1. Some 6.4 per cent are fully vaccinated.  While bigger deliveries of vaccines have played a role, the decision to involve GPs in the jab campaign has also been key to the newfound speed.    Doctors administered more than 1.1m in their first week alone and are expected to ramp up even further as dose quantities increase. The gear change could see the entire adult population receive a first jab by July 18, two months early and be fully vaccinated by August 8, according to the German Institute for Public Health Insurance (ZI).  A shadow on the horizon is the concern the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine may cause blood clots. Germany has factored the vaccine heavily into its plans — it is expecting an order of 10m jabs — and any decision to limit its use could slow the country’s roll-out.  Meanwhile, in Italy, daily inoculations are hovering above 200,000 new doses administered per day since late last month. Some 9.7m first doses have been administered and 4.1m second ones. Officials have expressed optimism restrictions could be eased soon if the pace of immunisation continues to pick up. That may be premature. On Wednesday, Italy reported another 16,000 new cases in 24 hours and 469 more deaths.  Indeed, the persistently high infection and death rates and hospitalisations threaten to jeopardise plans to relax rules in the coming weeks as Europeans eye Britain’s lockdown exit with envy.  Keen to cajole a country under nationwide semi-confinement and a 7pm to 6am curfew, Mr Macron held talks with the French government on Thursday night on an exit roadmap and his aides hinted that he aimed to progressive reopen cafes and restaurants, along with cultural venues by mid-May. “  “We need some quick wins to raise morale,” fretted junior social economy minister Olivia Grégoire. “(Reopening) terraces is a small victory to brighten our daily lives.”  But ministers have already warned that this is still only “hypothetical”. Mr Macron will address the nation by the end of the month.  Macron has claimed the EU could catch up with Britain “in the coming weeks” With intensive care beds filling up in Germany, Angela Merkel is struggling to push a new law through parliament to take control of lockdown measures out of the hands of the country’s 16 regional governments and impose tough national restrictions for the first time, including night-time curfews for the worst-hit areas. She has already met fierce political resistance from the regions some of who want to go the other way.  As summer beckons, EU countries, including Germany, France and Italy, remain closed to tourism for now.  But some are forging ahead with holiday plans regardless.  Greece intends to open borders on 14 May for all travellers who have been vaccinated or provide a negative coronavirus test. Croatia says it is opening up those who can prove they have had a second doses at least two weeks previously.  Meanwhile, EU governments have reached a common position on plans for digital vaccination certificates, which could eventually pave the way to a vaccine passport system open to Britons hoping to travel to Europe. The EU-only plans must be agreed with MEPs before they can become law, which could be before the end of June.  Mass vaccinations are key to getting European economies back on track.  Last month, the OECD said it expected the UK economy to grow by 5.1 per cent this year and 4.7 per cent in 2022 - a significant increase on its December 2020 estimate. Its EU growth forecast was also increased to 3.9 per cent for 2021 — however, this was a much smaller uplift than elsewhere due to its slow vaccine rollout.  “Reflecting the periodic infection waves and the pace of vaccinations, the economic recovery in Europe is still halting and uneven,"" said Alfred Kammer, director of the International Monetary Fund's European department.  ""We are suggesting an extra push, and an extra effort"" to limit permanent damage to the region's productivity.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/mthmlk/whisper_it_quietly_europes_vaccination_programme/guzo4tb/

The only way these passports make sense is to implement them now to allow some industries such as travel and leisure to open up earlier, and people who have been vaccinated to start to get their lives back.   The talk about segregation and discrimination annoys me because it’s not really that different to the tier system that stopped swathes of people doing anything whilst other parts of the country had much greater freedom. If it was acceptable to do that based on science (ie local infection rates), then it should ok to implement passports on the same basis (which is that you are a lower risk to others if you have been vaccinated).  Given the pace of the vaccination roll out most people aren’t going to have to wait that long to get their passport and it could be an incentive for compliance. As long as it’s not implemented for anything essential ie going to work, food shopping, medical appointments, there shouldn’t really be an issue.

For international travel I completely understand and sympathise, especially given that certain countries will be before / behind others for a certain duration of time in their individual response. However the introduction of a domestic vaccine certificate just wreaks of overstepping the mark.  First of all, it harms the younger persons who still await to be inoculated over the preferred elderly and so forth in the immediate term - which seems a tad discriminatory off of the bat. Can you go back to work? No, not vaccined, pub - no not vaccined, etc.  Second of all, the suggestion of using the NHS track and trace app makes me feel not truly at my own liberty, especially given our government's preference for misuse of data, tracking and privacy. All seem to slide under the category of mistake or 'nothing to hide if you've done nothing wrong' rather than what it actually is, mass surveillance forced on the populace, and using the media to construe the narrative as a good thing.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/lnbtkz/ruk_weekly_freetalk_covid19_news_random_thoughts/goijgcv/
732,3,1614128378,"No one's getting locked up though, a vaccine passport doesn't remove your ability to go outside, visit the shops ect. You might have to wear a mask but how is that any different to the current situation.  Can't sit inside the pub? Ohhh no guess you'll have to sit outside in the summer.   Refuse to get the vaccine? Then that's your choice, but the majority are not going to be punished for your own selfishness.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/lqliae/covid19_pm_promises_review_on_issues_of_vaccine/goj3l52/

735,0,1613838783,"Personally I would only accept a Vaccine passport if it had a nice big red and white St George's cross on it. Blue is the colour for Scotland's national flag and since they don't want to be part of the United Kingdom anymore, it is only fitting to leave them out on the colour of our beloved passports.",unitedkingdom,t5_2qhqb,/r/unitedkingdom/comments/lo6jnl/52_of_britons_support_vaccine_passports_on/go4rp5j/
