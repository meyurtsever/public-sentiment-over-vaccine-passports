2,0,1639532236,"The 3 year visa has just a couple more questions on the applications form.   From what I know, there is not usually an increased time for processing at the consular office, unless there are questions.  Your visa processing company will have the best answers for you.  As several have said, getting the invitation letter (a requirement to complete the tourist visa application) is your first milestone.  Your hotel can email one to you after you book your rooms.  Various processing companies will charge you for expedited visa service, but your passport (and completed application) still has to physically get to a Russian consular office.     And it's not just the time for the Russian consular office to process the application, it is also the shipping time from you to your processing company, and then back to you.  You might get it done by throwing money at it, but it's gonna be close and likely spendy.  Christmas and Covid are just gonna make mail and shipping slower.     And you probably won't know if you will get your visa (and passport) back in time until just a few days before your flight.",russia,t5_2qh75,/r/russia/comments/rggb70/help_with_visiting_russia/hol7d8s/
3,0,1638898511,"Visited in July and again in late October, but stayed at a hotel, so they registered me.  Overall, I had zero problems.  I brought my passport, a printed out and digital version of negative Covid test,  the Rospotrebnadzor application, my Russian Visa and my insurance info (was not checked but is listed on the application form).  When entering this last time, they checked my passport, verified my visa, checked electronically to see that I had return tickets, took the application form, checked the Covid test and checked that I had a hotel listed as my place of stay on the application form.  Perhaps 5-8 minutes in total.  You get the migration card at that point and you are through.  A few things to highlight.  Be aware of the 6 month passport expiration rule.    You can download the application form from tourism.gov.ru and pre fill it out.  Otherwise you will be filling it out on the airplane as you descend into Russia.  If you have never seen one, the migration card is a little slip of paper, a bit smaller than your passport.  It is not a receipt or piece of random paper.  If you are not expecting it, it can be easy to dismiss or lose.  But it is important, don't lose it.  You will need it at hotel check-in and for registration.  And it will be turned in at the airport when you leave Russia.  Have a fun trip!",russia,t5_2qh75,/r/russia/comments/rafnlo/any_american_citizen_that_recently_travelled_to/hnm6kk5/
4,0,1638820498,"If you are staying in a hotel, or a guest of someone, it is their responsibility to register you. I believe the law is if you are in the same place longer than 3 days you should register. But again, the hotel takes care of this. They take your passport, migration paper, make some copies and usually that evening give you a second piece of paper if I'm not mistaken. If your visiting friends/family, we do this in the post office..same thing tho. Passport, migration paper..tear off bottom stamped from post office and done.  You should just need your US Passport, Visa (in passport of course), covid test and letter of invite (no one asks for the letter).  As far as covid goes? I went through DME in the summer and they just had the foreigners do COVID papers on the plane.

5,1,1638822152,"I hope not, I'm Russian/American :) But I do have experience in this back/forth as I travel(ed) quite a bit through the airports pre-covid. Your migration paper is just this tiny little thing that fits in your passport. Customs prints it and has you sign it before you leave their area. When you leave Russia, you are to surrender the paper. Every time I'd leave with friends/co-workers, etc, customs always collected it from them. Don't lose it, or they get upset.

They are closed for tonight but I'll write them an email and have a friend try and contact them tomorrow. Special living permission is apparently a different document that tourists do not receive.

8,0,1636413538,"Hey! I actually have been researching this. I'm a US citizen as well with a tourist visa that's expiring in April 2022, and I really want to visit once more before my visa expires. I was under the impression that you just had to have a passport and visa from any country on the list, and arrive on a direct flight from any country on the list. I didn't think that the passport country and direct flight country had to be the same. The website I have been using to read all the entry restrictions is [Covid Controls](https://covidcontrols.co/traveller-entry). But from the link that you provided from tourism.gov.ru it sounds like you actually do need to arrive from the same country of your citizenship... I would recommend contacting the agency that you got your visa through, or the one that I got mine through are amazing and super helpful (World Visit Center in Washington DC)... They might be able to clarify. Anyway, good luck. If I decide to go around New Years, perhaps I can message you and we could meet up? I did make a few friends in Moscow and St. Petersburg, but not sure what their plans are for New Years yet.",russia,t5_2qh75,/r/russia/comments/qpiivj/can_anyone_clarify_russias_entry_requirements/hjv7m8w/
9,0,1635704247,"As a person from NA who’s currently here in Russia, the simple answer is that you can’t.  Only way to get it is by getting shot of the vaccine in Russia (Sputnik, not sure about the other 2).  I got Pfizer, the best you can do is to have the proof of vaccination of Pfizer, along with your passport.  Some places may allow you to enter, some will refuse. All depends on the mood of the workers at the establishment.  For foreigners, you’d have better chance entering somewhere by doing PCR Test, which is probably the best option, besides actually getting covid vaccine again.",russia,t5_2qh75,/r/russia/comments/qju6ll/im_an_american_traveling_to_russia_for_the_first/hisi2zv/
10,0,1634608975,"Yes, you can.  There is a 3 year, multi-entry tourist visa available to US citizens.  This allows you to spend up to 180 days a year in Russia.    You will still need to meet all other COVID and entry requirements for each entry (hotel reservation/invitation letter to document where you will be staying when in Russia).  You can download the application and fill it out yourself, but the big hurdle is that your passport must physically walk into a Russian embassy or (consular service office that is processing visas) for approval and for the visa to get physically placed into your passport.  This can take between a few days and several weeks, assuming your application is approved.  There are services that will do that step for you (and help with completing the application) or you can travel to a suitable location and wait for the visa yourself.  I would recommend using a service if you don't live within driving distance.

14,0,1623477877,"As far as I know, the Russian consulate in US is not granting any visas to Americans (barring emergencies) and vice versa. It’s because relations are so bad that each country dismissed most of the other’s diplomatic staff (very stupid, but it is what it is). There may be other options, like going to a different country to get the visa, but if you want to go in the fall it might be too late.   The Covid situation adds an extra layer of complexity because you need a negative test 72 hours before takeoff to get on the plane and then TWO tests 24 hours apart when you arrive. The first you can take at the airport, but for the second you need to find a local clinic unless you plan to go to the airport two days in a row.   Knowing Russian would help immensely, especially since there aren’t a lot of tourists there right now.   There are no special dangers to Americans compared with other people. You may end up paying more for museums and such (last time I went they have the “normal” rate and the “discount” rate if you’re from one of the former Soviet republics).   The rest is basic travel safety - stay in a good area, protect your passport (though many places ask for ID, so you may need to carry it; make sure you have copies just in case). Have money in more than one place. Be aware of your surroundings and don’t look like an “easy target.” Have a contingency plan in case you lose your phone, wallet or documents. Not trying to scare you and this is not specific to Russia. All major cities of the world have their small share of unsavory individuals that look for opportunities to exploit others or steal things when you’re not paying attention to your surroundings. Street smarts are built through experience, but you can learn some starting pointers from your grandpa to help you avoid the most common pitfalls.

15,0,1619425026,"1. May I renew my visa before my current one expires?  yes, but check if the russian embassy is delivering your type of visa now in your country. For a lot of places, there is no tourist/private/business visas delivered now due to the covid.  if it is working visa/HQS, I think it is more probable that they deliver them  Also if it is a working/hqs visa, your company (or an immigration law firm) must write a letter to the FSB so that they put you on the list of authorized people that can cross the border (because officialy US is closed now for Russia)   &amp;#x200B;  1. Is there a limit to how soon I can re-apply? For example, you can re-apply no sooner than 3 months before your visa expires.  I don't know about this, but I think even 6 months before your visa expires you can start renewing it.  Anyway, once putting the new visa on your passport, they will cancel the former one with a specific stamp.  &amp;#x200B;  1. If your renewal is denied can you still use the current one until it expires? Reason question below.

16,0,1610312570,"In short, no.  In long: My impression is that you would not be allowed into Belarus in the first place. A Russian tourist visa does not grant you entry into Belarus. Under normal circumstances, you would be able to visit Belarus if you were travelling by air for up to a month, but currently Belarus is not allowing people to enter the country unless they are residents. [https://gpk.gov.by/covid-19/en/](https://gpk.gov.by/covid-19/en/)  If you were allowed into Belarus (say, in a month or whenever entry is permitted again), I think you would have trouble crossing the border into Russia. I was in a bordering province recently and the people there told me that only commercial vehicles (e.g., shipments of goods) are being let through.   If normal border travel resumes between Russia and Belarus but entry for US passport holders into Russia does not, it would be illegal to go through the border. In normal times it is possible to cross the border without having your passport checked, but not guaranteed. If you were somehow to make it through, you would not have passed through Russian border security and would be in the country illegally. You would not have a Russian migration card or a stamp on your passport. When you exited Russia, you would need to avoid Russian border guards (e.g., by exiting into Belarus), because a border guard (e.g., at the airport) would have you detained upon seeing that you had no entry stamp.",russia,t5_2qh75,/r/russia/comments/ktzun2/entering_russia_from_belarus/giss29i/
