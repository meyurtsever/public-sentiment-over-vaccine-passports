I believe the job of the government is to present its citizens with as much facts as it can and yet leave consent to the individual. I am of the opinion that vaccine mandates are fundamentally wrong. If you don't have sovereignty over your own body, then what do you have left? You might as well not live.  &gt; If someone decides they are not ready to take any vaccine for any reason. That should be their sovereign right. If you are happy to take a vaccine, again, that is your personal right. No one should force anyone else to do anything.

However, this notion of sovereignty would be inapplicable in times of emergency, such as the pandemic we're in.  &gt; Mask mandate &amp; vaccine passport. I don't really know how I feel about this. On one hand I do see the appeal of the wider benefit of keeping the community safe, on the other hand I do not agree that the government should have the right of telling you where you can and cannot go based on whether you have taken a jab.

In times of emergency, a unified measure will mitigate the aftermath better.  &gt; No difference in 'user experience' of vaccinated vs unvaccinated. Vaccinated: Can catch covid, can spread covid, can be hospitalised, can die. Unvaccinated: Can catch covid, can spread covid, can be hospitalised, can die.  The science behind COVID is still at its infancy; science ain't a magic bullet. To use an analogy, wearing seat belts can reduce car crash fatalities by thousand folds but idiots will still argue personal freedom and complaining discomfort and inconveniences.  &gt; Never have I ever seen a movement on this scale to coerce people into taking a vaccine, and to dehumanise those who don't comply.   Read up on centuries of human history battling plagues.  &gt; Do not vaccinate the children. I am happy KKM's stance is that vaccination of kids is optional. The death rate of SARS CoV-2 is &lt;0.0115% in children below 12 (per KKM data). This is THE SAME as the death rate of the common cold in children below 12 (per CDC data). So why vaccinate kids?  Because the science behind COVID is not fully understood, and that kids' immune system is still developing.  &gt; Goalposts keep changing. They took your fundamental human right freedoms under the guise of keeping you safe. Then they said you'll get your freedoms back when you get vaccinated. Then they said not good enough, get boosted. No one knows how the goalpost will change next.  Refer to the above counterpoints. The goalpost will always be subject to change. That's not necessarily a bad thing.  As for the remarks on how other countries are handling COVID, do note that their strategies and countermeasures have yet to yield results. For example, Japanese government's natural immunity plan is heavily criticised by their own citizens, especially during the Olympics last year.

1,1,1643273923,"Here are the low-down, from my recent experience.  1. Within 2 days before your board the plane, get the Covid test. Make sure you don't have a weekend between the test and you leaving — then the 2 days over Sunday (where labs are closed) is a non-started.  In such case, you'd have to pay much dollars for a same-day result. 2. (actually, the stupid cert that the foreign clinic produced can be forged easily, so it is a stupid thing to require that) 3. The website you apply for is basically for home Quarantine, otherwise, you'd be assigned a center to do your quarantine — hotel, or MOH's god-forsaken dorm centers. 4. So, to apply for home quarantine, you will have to prep before hand:    1. Get low-res photos of the house (outside &amp; in) you plan to quarantine in    2. Get low-res images of your Covid vaccination certs, passports, IC    3. From the US, go to this website, [https://hso.moh.gov.my](https://hso.moh.gov.my)    4. You can only apply for this home quarantine no more than X days before your flight. 5. Once it is approved, you will be given an email.  Save that email, as you will need to show that to the MOH person at KLIA (I don't know about other airports). This email can came to you on the day you fly, or when you are in transit.  How's that for tension? 6. Why low-res images?  The fackers who developed the web-site placed a size restriction on the uploads per file (250Kb).  You better be a tech person who can deal with shrinking file sizes, etc.  Those damn facking facks . 7. Once you land in the KLIA, you will be taken on a bus to the quarantine area.  On the bus, you will see QR codes.  Get started on entering the data they need, while the rest of the passengers just stand there like dummies.  If you have many flights coming at the same time, this time saved can get you through the queues quicker. 8. Get your ticket, and passport ready, as you will need to furnish some data through the website.  Enter those data in darkness while you sway inside the bus. 9. When you finally get to the counters, they will check your data you entered already, your MOH home quarantine order, COVID results, MySejahtera (if you have it) or vaccination certificates, blah blah blah. 10. If all in order, you go through another Covid test, and they give you a lanyard. 11. You clear Immigration, then get to the MOH counters where they take your lanyard and then put some sort of wrist band tracker thinjamajig. 12. I think then, you clear immigration and customs after that.  ps. I don't know if these processes are changed from country-to-country.  I was coming back from the US.  And I don't know if the recent change in policy by KJ is in effect already.",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/sdtpig/returning_from_overseas_registration_website_with/huf1jr4/

Covid is a disease of the aged &amp;  immunocompromised. When was the last time KKM told you to eat well, get enough sunlight, exercise and boost your natural immune system?   \- The virus is real but the response of governments all over the world from the start of the pandemic has been unprecedented and a vast overreach of powers. It is clear, even as recent as today from Denmark, that lockdowns kill economies more effectively than it prevents Covid spread. If lockdowns worked, then everyone in the UAE (which has not had a lockdown since June 2020) should have caught Covid and died by now.  \- Goalposts keep changing. They took your fundamental human right freedoms under the guise of keeping you safe. Then they said you'll get your freedoms back when you get vaccinated. Then they said not good enough, get boosted.

Below is the article (not OP link)     **Hidden camera reveals 'appalling' conditions in overseas PPE factory supplying Canadian hospitals, expert says**Posted: Jan 15, 2021 4:00 AM ET | Last Updated: January 17  As global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) surges during the pandemic, so has the human cost for those making it overseas, an investigation by CBC’s Marketplace has found.  *Hidden camera footage inside the world's largest glove manufacturer in Malaysia shows several employees working in close quarters. Shortly after, there was a massive COVID-19 outbreak that led to nearly 6,000 infections. (Name withheld)*  The wall of noise is constant as the workers manually check, sort and pack a seemingly endless supply of disposable gloves into boxes destined for international markets like Canada.  The production line, filled mostly with migrant workers, is cramped. Yet COVID-19 protocols like sanitizing, physical distancing or mask-wearing, meant to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, don't seem to be enforced at this Malaysian factory.  ""They just want \[you\] to work. They just want product. They don't care about the worker,"" said one employee from Nepal, who works 12 hours every day.  In spite of these health risks, some employees say they can't leave their jobs. They say they have significant debt — often borrowed at the hands of unscrupulous lenders — having paid recruitment agencies massive fees to line them up for their jobs.  ""I don't have any choice, I have to work \[to pay off my debt\],"" said another worker from Bangladesh, who makes around $3 an hour and is paying back loans two years after starting his job.  As global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) surges during the pandemic, so has the human cost for those making it overseas, an investigation by CBC's Marketplace has found.  The investigation into the global PPE trade revealed that some of the life-saving equipment Canadian health-care workers are using appears to be made in sweatshop-like conditions — raising doubts about Canada's commitment to international human rights and its ability to prevent unethically sourced goods from entering the country.  Workers at the Top Glove factory in Malaysia wait in line to be tested for COVID-19 following a plantwide outbreak in November. (Reuters)  ""We can say without doubt that the \[glove\] industry remains a hotbed of systemic forced labour and modern slavery,"" said Andy Hall, an international migrant worker rights specialist based in Southeast Asia. ""\[Migrant workers\] are not seen as human beings…. They're often treated as second-class citizens and systemically abused.""  Several Canadian companies that have tens of millions of dollars in PPE contracts with the federal government imported goods from the Malaysian manufacturers Marketplace investigated.  ""Canada is tainted and Canada is complicit in this abuse that's going on,"" said Hall.  ***How unethically sourced PPE could be ending up in some Canadian hospitals | Marketplace***    Marketplace spoke to nearly two dozen employees at disposable glove factories in Malaysia who say they face unsafe work and living conditions and violence on the job. Many of these goods could be making their way into the Canadian health-care system. 3:13  Canada, through import laws, prohibits the entry of goods that are produced with forced labour, which according to the International Labour Organization (ILO) can include such indicators as debt bondage, restriction of movement, excessive overtime and poor living conditions.  Yet according to records reviewed by Marketplace, millions of disposable gloves manufactured by Malaysian companies in conditions that experts say have the hallmarks of forced labour have come into our ports.  Hidden camera footage also showed unsafe working and poor living conditions inside a Malaysian factory, which Hall described as ""really, really appalling"" after viewing the video.  ***Hidden camera reveals where some of your PPE comes from***  An insider documents conditions inside his factory and workers’ dorms and a labour activist reacts to what he calls “appalling” conditions at a Top Glove factory in Malaysia. 2:05  Marketplace interviewed 23 current and former migrant workers from across the disposable glove industry in Malaysia who detailed various stories of alleged exploitation: situations of debt bondage, deceptive recruiting practices, passport retention, excessive overtime, abusive workplaces and deplorable living conditions.  Gloves of all types — nitrile, vinyl, latex — are used by health-care workers in many situations,  including swabbing, intubating and examinations. Some health-care professionals can go through several boxes of gloves a week.  ""The only reason I haven't gotten sick, it isn't just luck — it's PPE,"" said  Dr. Nadia Alam, a family doctor and anesthesiologist in Georgetown, Ont. ""It makes me mad that nobody's taking care of \[these workers\].... It's despicable, these kind of practices.""  Dr. Nadia Alam, a physician in Georgetown, Ont., credits PPE with keeping her safe throughout the pandemic. (CBC)  In 2020, Malaysian glove makers produced close to 220 billion gloves, about 70 per cent of the world's supply, according to the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association. Manufacturers rely heavily on migrant workers from countries with few employment opportunities, including Myanmar, Indonesia, Nepal and Bangladesh.  Reports of human rights abuses in the PPE industry aren't isolated to gloves. Gowns were reportedly being made with North Korean forced labour. Masks were being made by ethnic Uyghurs as part of a controversial labour transfer program in China.  ""This is an issue around the world,""  said Hall. ""The whole supply chain of medical products, ventilators, masks, gloves, gowns, it's all coming from an industry with systemic forced labour issues.""",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/qwdbh6/canada_halts_import_of_goods_linked_to_forced/hl2wjlv/

13,0,1635386740,"**By Liza Lin, Yifan Wang and Jon Emont**  *Oct. 27, 2021 11:22 am ET*  SINGAPORE—Chinese laborer Zhang Qiang set off for Indonesia in March to work for a Chinese steelmaker. Six months later, he was wading through the waters off Malaysia’s shores with four other men, fleeing what he called a scam.  “I felt we were cheated, yet also felt I was helpless,” Mr. Zhang said in an interview from Malaysia, where the men were detained by local authorities.  Mr. Zhang said he was lured to Indonesia by the promise of a better paying job, but his passport was taken once he got off the plane. He and other workers were asked to sign contracts for lower pay and longer durations than they had been promised.  Around 600,000 Chinese migrant workers were employed abroad at the end August, according to official government data, with many of them working for Chinese companies on projects connected to President Xi Jinping’s signature Belt and Road infrastructure-building initiative.  China Labor Watch, a labor rights group based in New York, says experiences like those of Mr. Zhang and his colleagues aren’t uncommon. Based on interviews with around 200 workers in 12 countries and information from a whistleblower in China’s trade ministry who it hasn’t publicly identified, the group estimates that tens of thousands of workers abroad are being paid less than they were promised or exploited in other ways.  China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs didn’t respond to a request for comment. Beijing has acknowledged the existence of illegal and unlicensed labor dispatch practices over the years. In 2012, the Ministry of Commerce issued a new rule aimed at protecting the rights of overseas workers, and in 2016 asked local authorities to step up enforcement of the rule due to continued violations.  Mr. Zhang, a 31-year-old father of two from China’s central Henan province, was promised the equivalent of about 15,000 yuan ($2,300) a month for a period of six months—an attractive prospect for a man who earned far less welding metal bars at construction sites in China, he said.  He was employed at a work site in the Morowali Industrial Park, a Belt and Road project where Chinese steel giants had invested in large-scale smelting of nickel for use in making stainless steel and electric-vehicle batteries.  Launched in 2013, the trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative aims to tie countries around the world to the Chinese economy through a new network of roads, railways, ports, power plants and factories.  Chinese companies invested at least $12.7 billion into Indonesian steel and nickel projects since 2013, drawn by its large nickel reserves, according to a Wall Street Journal tally of such projects.  The reliance by Chinese companies on labor brought from China instead of local hires has fed resentment in some places. Earlier this year, a large Indonesian labor union criticized the use of unskilled Chinese laborers, saying it cheated local workers out of jobs.Mr. Zhang’s journey began in mid-March, when he saw an advertisement for the Indonesia job in a chat message group for migrant workers. Lured by the promise of a pay bump, he contacted the recruiter who posted the ad and packed a suitcase, reassuring his family that the move would fund a better life, according to his wife, Wang Lan.“When I come back, I’ll buy you a bed,” he told the younger of his two daughters, before boarding a bus in the city of Anyang, in Henan province, to head to the airport, Ms. Wang said.Chinese labor contractors have to obtain a government license before arranging for workers to go overseas.   Commercial and human resources bureaus in the eastern city of Wuxi, where Mr. Zhang’s privately-run contractor Rongcheng Environmental Engineering Co. is based, said no local companies had obtained such a license.Ms. Wang said her husband wasn’t given a contract to sign before leaving and didn’t think to ask the company for proof of a license.   Rongcheng didn’t respond to a request for comment.Arriving in Indonesia, Mr. Zhang and other workers recruited from China were told to put their passports in a box, according to an account posted on WeChat by Mr. Zhang and other workers in early September. They were then transported to a metal smelter site in Morowali operated by Jiangsu Delong Nickel Co. Ltd., a privately-owned Chinese steelmaker whose nickel-production operation in Indonesia was described by Chinese authorities in May 2020 as a “key Belt and Road project.”   Rongcheng Environmental Engineering is a subcontractor for Jiangsu Delong.At Morowali, they were offered construction jobs at a salary of 10,000 yuan a month—instead of the promised 15,000—asked to work longer hours and presented with employment contracts that paid out 1,000 yuan in cash monthly—with the rest of their salary withheld until completion of the project at an unspecified date in the future, according to Ms. Wang.Jiangsu Delong didn’t respond to a request for comment.  Local anger toward Chinese workers means there are few politicians or local organizations in places like Indonesia who are focused on their welfare, which adds to their vulnerability, say labor experts.  China’s pursuit of a zero-Covid-19 strategy has further compounded the problem, according to China Labor Watch’s founder Li Qiang, whose organization has interviewed Chinese workers across Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe since August 2020. Drastic reductions in the number of international flights and stringent entry conditions, including antibody testing and long quarantines, have made it hard for many workers to return home, he said.  Chinese laborers in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Serbia told the Journal that with few new workers coming to replace them, existing workers are prevented or discouraged from returning. Those who want to leave often have to fork over large sums to pay for air tickets and quarantines, which can run between two to four weeks, the laborers said. Workers are generally promised airfare for their travel to and from the countries, but during the pandemic, employers have in many cases withheld the return airfare to get workers to stay longer on the job.  One worker building roads as part of a Belt and Road project in Papua New Guinea, who declined to be named, said about half of the 100 workers on the project are working past the end of their three-year contracts because they are unable to return home.  The price of returning home more than tripled to 65,000 yuan this year after the Chinese government ruled that citizens could only return home on direct flights, he said. With no direct flights from Papua New Guinea, workers needed to fly to Laos and quarantine there first before heading back to China, he said.",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/qhc9v5/chinese_workers_say_they_are_lured_abroad_and/hibvld1/

18,1,1629635254,Interesting! Malaysia immigration always asks for passport. They put a “cancellation “ stamp across your EP on passport. And then puts up  the visit visa on it.  Maybe they will ask for it once the cancellation is done.  They always ask for the original passport. I’m not sure if any of that process has changed due to covid.

Singapore just announced their ""Vaccinate or Regular Test"" regime today, effective from 1 October.  Source: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=374045344080951&amp;id=100044264657476&amp;sfnsn=mo  For example, if you are unvaccinated by the time the health pass system is in place, you are not allowed to leave your home at all unless you pay for two swab tests(whether positive or negative) each week. You are also forbidden to dine in, gyms and not allowed to attend large events such as concerts, parades.   But if you are vaccinated with both doses, you will be exempted from this requirement and you can enjoy the benefits of the vaccinated, such as dine in with 5 pax and above, no masks(save money) etc.   If they take the second dose now before the Malaysian government announces it, they won't have to rush and flock to get vaccinated at last minute like crowds in [France] (https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/more-than-900000-people-france-rush-covid-vaccine-tougher-measures-near-2021-07-13/) which can cause COVID clusters.

24,0,1628130850,"My 2 cents  The timing of the lockdown actually made people forget 2 large clusters that recently formed:  Genting Cluster  Raya Cluster  Genting cluster is large and is a great example of motherfucking stupid fuckers at top level of genting's management as well as the fucking gamblers. it also highlight HOW FUCKED we are with enforcement. how could they open? why are they allowed to open? HOW the fucking fuck?  were they summoned later? i dont have a clue  Raya cluster is also dumb BUT i can understand why people did it. i dont support people who drove back for raya, but at the very least its because of FAMILY. not because of stupid gambling addictions which is fucking inexcusable. that said, the  raya cluster would be a larger contributor to the numbers.   these 2 clusters were bombs that were waiting to trigger. people spread the virus here n there without knowing, thinking ""lockdown mah"" ""i m safe NOW mah"". nope. you wont know till its too fucking late. one of the gamblers from genting or one of the makciks who balik raya maybe went to a  supermarket, went around touching fruit. had close contact with the cashier, then the cashier spread it around to everyone else.  who the fuck knows how many people got it?   also, we are experiencing LOCKDOWN FATIGUE. people are starting to suicide, and those that dont, are pretty much DAMN tired of all the lockdowns. the last 2 month lock down is BULLSHIT.   some industries are left open FINE. i actually can accept that. some industries are actually essential. Beer closed down? FINE. But LV? someone on r/malaysia posted a sign showing LV could operate. LIKE WHAT THE FLYING FUCK? you fucking kidding me?  then theres the enforcement. cannot travel interstate. cannot travel more than 10km.  WHERES THE ENFORCEMENT?   i had been going to hospital interstate previously as someone close was hospitalized. i got caught and fined. OK i accept that i should get a doctors note or watever. i paid the fine and wasnt given leniency (except early payment discount). no time for compassion that someone i know is in hospital. FINE i honestly dont hold that against KKM. it was i who did not follow the proper procedure. i accept that.  but what grinds my gears is that i have driven past that same road block maybe 7-8 times and only ONCE was i actually stopped. another time that i was checked was when i had my documentations so they waved me off when i flashed it.   ROAD BLOCKS FOR WHAT? if you say road blocks cause jam. sure thats a given but, WHATS THE FUCKING  POINT OF ROADBLOCKS, if youre just gonna wave 90% of the people off?  ""he looks like hes not going anywhere"", ""oh he looks like hes going interstate""   whats the criteria? why bother having a road block if you dont check EVERYONE.   i strongly support a PROPER lockdown. many people might hate it, i've always supported the idea that we should have done proper lockdowns back last year.  but no. ""small people need to survive"". ""how to eat"". look at where we are now. i told people, our condition is like an athlete with leg injury. the athlete COULD continue training with LOW performance, lower recovery rate AND potential for harming his leg injury even more. OR take an extended but PROPER break allowing him to heal up first.  nope. a huge lot of people are stuck with how do we eat.   similarly schools. some parents say  ""if schools are closed, i cant work coz i need to take care of my kid"". look at what the fuck happened. schools opened, VERY SHORTLY people caught covid  from school clusters. now NOT ONLY do you  have to take care of your kid, your kid is sick. and YOU ARE TOO. so dont need to work either. good fucking job.  i do see the importance of education. i have no confidence that zoom education can work. but if a parent  is working from home or aren't able to work due to everywhere being closed. perhaps an idea, is why not..... TEACH YOUR CHILDREN YOURSELF? i m digressing.  we still live in a time where people do not fear the virus enough. some people say its fake. some people dont believe in vaccines. some people believe their faith will keep them protected.  it REALLY doesnt help that sometimes our LEADERS do not set a good example with photos of them breaking SOP. also, i DONT UNDERSTAND, why is it, that when you need to give a speech, or if you're being recorded, or if you're taking a simple selfie, YOU NEED to take your mask down? is your face so damn fucking important?   so are the influencers on insta/fb/tiktok. sometimes i wonder, are they breaking SOP being so close with other people? sure some of them may have the excuse ""i live with these people"". if thats the case STILL, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE WORD ""INFLUENCER?"" you are influencing people to disregard the SOP. WHO THE FUCK knows who's staying together? monkey see monkey do. in malaysia we have monkeys everywhere.  lets get back to lockdown fatigue, and suicides. people are tired. the people ""like me"" who follow  the SOP. play it safe etc. we're fucking tired. when people are tired, they tend to let their guard down. when we make ourselves vulnerable, our chances of getting it is higher. but at this point many of us are starting to no longer care. fuckit. kena, kenalah. nasib mah.  then theres the issue of VAXXHOLES. a lot of people are getting vaccinated. i am quite happy to hear that. BUT, some people are getting vaccinated SO THEY CAN GO OUT.   selfish fucks.   there are people who cannot vaccinate or have a risk that make them unable to vaccinate. these people are vulnerable. i dislike those who actively refuse vaccination but i would still sympathize. sometimes a child is born into a family of antivaxxers. are you telling me that you wouldnt mind spreading covid onto these people? really. wheres the sympathy? be a better person!  there are a lot of talks on allowing people to get a ""travel passport"". where having single/double vaccination allows you to go out/dine in etc. let me just bring you back to what i mentioned earlier. implementation and enforcement is SHIT. roadblocks are poorly implemented. what makes you certain that this travel passport can work?  the ""easiest"" solution is everyone is forced to show their vax status using mysejahtera. i admit this is the ONLY reasonable way to implement it. but it must come with REQUIRING people to show their IC/passport. i have witnessed a delivery company get blocked from entering a premise as one of their workers ""didnt bring phone"". they came back later and were allowed entry as the ""phone"" they brought has double vaccines and is in good status.  i strongly believe that people will not be diligent to check and ensure the phone/mysejahtera matches the person ID. checking the mysejahtera is already a hassle in itself.  i m digressing again.  the virus. is like a stupid chain mail. send this to 10 friends or bad luck falls onto you. some people check their mail late. forwards this to their friends. and their friends keep reforwarding it back to themselves over and over again.  a vicious cycle of infection because not everyone is taking it seriously enough.  i m fucking sick and tired of this shit.",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/oxyxid/why_is_malaysia_covid_cases_keep_rising/h7rapo9/

26,0,1626102301,"Thanks for your honest response. I hope the discussion can continue without personal attacks.  I'd like to dig a bit deeper to better understand where you are coming from, as I too have encountered a few anti-vax and vaccine hesitant individual.  From what I gather, it's not that you do not take the pandemic seriously, but that you do not trust the authority mandating the vaccine. Is this only at the local scale (incompetent govt), or is it in line with more of the global mistrust (globalist central control agenda)? If not can you help articulate your point of view? I can understand if the mistrust is local, and if the virus is only affecting the region. But seeing that the pandemic is global, and we can see the daily news  countries that have started to open up due to more vaccination, what else would it take to convince you to register? Also do you see any other way free people could tackle the issue of global pandemic without global coordination and support?     Secondly, do you work or have close friends who work with people in the medical field? Do you accept their concern that the longer the virus exists and is allowed to spread, the higher the chance for it to evolve into something more deadly? What are your thoughts on vaccination for people who work at the hospitals where they are exposed to infected people far more than the normal person?     There are many reasons for one to be anti-vax/vaccine hesitant, so is good to be able to have civilized discussion about it. From my own encounter, the most anti-vax person I have personally talked to at length, has a general mistrust of authority both locally and globally. She also came from a religious background that saw current events as fulfilling some biblical prophecy. At one point she also brought up parallels with the 'mark of the beast' to the vaccine, and vaccine passports being a way for the globalist to control human kind. It took a bit of convincing to show that we have always needed some sort of vaccine passport to travel to high risk area. It's just that this is a global pandemic the type we only see once a century, and everywhere is high risk, before the conversation could be brought back closer to reality. It took a few months of discussion before she decided to change her view on the vaccine.  Another vaccine hesitant encounter is not my own but that of a family member who had a friend who also adopted the wait and see approach. She did not register even when her age group has already long been called for appointment. I could not get any further details behind her hesitancy, other than she wanted to ""wait and see"". Unfortunately she contracted Covid in May, admitted to ICU, put on oxygen and had organ failure after 2 months. She passed away recently without her family by her side.  I'm not sharing this to scare you into registering, or forcing my P.O.V on you. Just to share my stories of people I have encountered (not on internet). If other people can share their experience with people they know ( in real life), or their own reasons for choosing not to vaccinate, please share.

It was posted at September 2019 and the video is talking about ""rehersal of containing a pandemic"" and coincidentally we have the pandemic.

Let's just touch a surface discussion on our daily. People have been blaming the local authority for the incompetency of controlling the pandemic. IMO, its all down to rakyat self discipline. I meant during MCO i do witness a lot of people not follow the SOP and do whatever they want, ie group activities w/o mask. Take Taiwan as a case study, they did impose a self lockdown prior goverment imposing it. Regarding to my thought on those doctor who exposed themselves with the patients, i do believe that they have the knowledge how to prevent themselves and they know better than most us what do to prevent from getting it.

It wont be surprise that you did open some of my mind in the discusssion. I myself is not a religious person , and yes i do heard the ""mark of beast"" theory and ""insert the chips into our body"". Dont be surprised that i do heard about 5g is related to covid-19 haha. I strongly oppose a vaccine passport and it is taking away our human rights. I do believe that we can win over this pandemic with the history of(Plague disease, Spanish Flu,although it is not a global scale).      I do heard of alot of funny theories on anti vacc as well haha. What i am trying to express is i do not want to blindly follow the crowd for the vaccine. I do not take vaccine due to peer pressure and i think for myself why should/shouldnt i take the vaccine. Do let me know if you have any question.

If you're in uni, many private unis have voluntary student exchange programs where you could do a maximum of two semesters abroad while still paying local tuition fees. It's still going on if you can find a placement during COVID, but it'll pick up again after all this. If you're not in school, just backpack and do unofficial jobs for some months and see if you find a reason to stay out there. Luckily, Malaysia has a very high passport power index.  I started traveling alone at eighteen and fell in love with Thailand and West/Central Europe because they are both very liberal places. Even their hardliners aren't as bad as the hardliners here. Malays look so silly when you come back. They freak out at pork and alcohol and not praying and LGBT people. Literal cave people from Plato's allegory.

Its been only about 18 months (21 if you count the 3 months China did an information blackout to hide the pandemic in its early stages in Wuhan) since the virus made its debut on this planet.  &amp;#x200B;  Second being that when herd immunity is achieved worldwide, most nations probably wont give a hoot about these passports because their own citizens are already vaccinated. This idea applies for most vaccinable diseases, where we dont have any sort of vaccine passports for them, despite some of them posing a much higher threat than Covid for a nation's population.  &amp;#x200B;  Honestly tho, I hope that Malaysia continues to accelerate towards herd immunity, and in the future make the vaccines widely available to the public via private practices. Once this is achieved, the need for ""vaccine passports"" will be drastically reduced, and by then we'd be able to dismiss the need for it. I think it will be a massive waste of taxpayer money anyways, as they will need to create a database to keep the vaccination records, and then they will need to pay the cops to run investigations on people questioning overbudgeting of the department.",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/o4msgd/health_dg_vaccination_passport_for_interstate/h2ijtcu/

OP friend biggest issue is not really the expired passport, but the fact she travelled out on japan passport, but is keen on emergency returning on malaysian passport as citizen to be with family. they will 1000% know if you travel out on one passport and try and return on another, from lack of visa and entry/exit stamp. so her malaysia passport being expired is moot really. it's whether or not she wants to deal with the immigration hoo ha ha of two passports and nationality which is not allowed by both malaysia and japan. so double trouble.  otherwise safest best again is just to wait till borders open up, tough as it may be to wait to be with family, and travel back in on japan passport, then renew malaysian passport - by which time normal passport services should be resumed, as borders open when covid situation is under control.",malaysia,t5_2qh8b,/r/malaysia/comments/nbteno/expired_malaysian_passport_in_japan/gy1s8km/

Bear in mind that all COVID SOPs worldwide are fluid, so this rule is applicable at this point in writing. I arrived today, so today would be day zero!  It is only 8.45pm yet I am exhausted. However, I am trying to maintain my sleep schedule, so I won't go to bed this early.  Here is a brief run down of today:   1. KLIA  Very quick process. Showed immigration officers my IPA STP (student pass) and my letter from MOE Singapore proving that I have enrollment in Singapore along with passport. Very empty airport! If you have a student pass + MOE letter, you dont need MTP. As always, check with your nearest immigration office JIM to clarify the SOP before flying! __Reddit reviews do not count as doing research ah.__  2. Changi Airport Greeted by staff in full hazmat suits. Quick process, the aim was to get us tested quickly and shuttled to the quarantine facility ASAP. The test involved taking samples from both nostrils + throat as opposed to the one nostril + throat sample in Malaysia.  Had no idea what was the destination until we reached. Will not reveal hotel name here till I have left. Received test results (negative) within 3 hours, scarily efficient, maybe cuz not that many samples to test d due to zero community cases.   I have another test on the 13th day. If that one comes out as negative, I get to leave on the 14th day. I like my room thus far! Staff are very friendly and helpful.    Ok that is all for now!

Sometime around mid 2020, I tried to renew my passport at the Embassy of Malaysia in Bangkok and to my surprise, the clerk there told me they can't do it and my only option is to return to Malaysia to get it renewed. The clerk also told me the embassy only accepts passport renewal applications for individuals with medical conditions that prevent them from traveling back to Malaysia. At the time, I found it ridiculous and hard to believe but then I found their website saying something similar:  [https://www.kln.gov.my/web/tha\_bangkok/passport\_renewal](https://www.kln.gov.my/web/tha_bangkok/passport_renewal)  By November 2020 when the daily COVID-19 cases in Malaysia were skyrocketing, I went to the same embassy again and this time they can make an exception and allowed me to submit an application to renew my passport. However, they'll have to forward my documents to Putrajaya for processing and I can only expect to receive my new passport after 3 months. So yeah, I still haven't got my new passport as of now.
