Many hotels and apartment complexes have a no-foreigner policy because it's a hassle to process their stays at the local police bureaus.  It's not racism; they would treat a Han with a US passport better than a minority from Yunnan with a Chinese passport for this reason.     Everybody is required to wear a mask while in a taxi, or on public transport.  Doesn't matter if you're Chinese or not.  I personally don't think the masks work at all, but nobody is allowed on the metro systems I've seen without a mask on, foreigner or native.     I stayed in a hotel two weeks ago and did not show a COVID test.  Nobody was asked for one in our group.

8,8,0,1638629678,"The process was one of ‘debasing themselves’. ‘Definitely you feel the indignity,’ he says. ‘When you start doing that over time, it changes you.’ It breaks down human relations into a ‘transactional’ state, he says. &lt;img class=""responsive lazy-image__img article-body-image__source"" src=""/content/dam/world-news/2021/11/30/Red-Roulette-Whitney-and-Desmond_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqMcMAF0Ek3tvPCqahlC6JU0r20To26NFuragGj_rUwF8.jpeg?imwidth=480"" alt=""Whitney and Desmond"" loading=""lazy"" width=""1988"" height=""1243""/&gt;  Together, Duan and Shum rose from nothing to become gatekeepers at the highest levels of power and amassed a fortune worth billions He and Duan were always serving the hierarchy. Part of that meant buying just the right gift at the right time, from $300,000 in medical expenses for one official, to a $10,000 watch, a private jet trip to a French Rothschild vineyard or a pair of fur-lined boots for the minister of a snowy region. I put it to Shum that we have a name for this in the West: corruption. He was an enthusiastic participant in this system, yet now he’s playing the warrior against it. Isn’t he a hypocrite? ‘I’m no warrior,’ he says dismissively. As for the other charges: ‘I don’t care… You can say I’m a hypocrite, I’m a good person, I’m a bad person, whatever, I don’t mind.’ All he is, he says, is a witness. Shum maintains that he and Duan never paid bribes. They were simply giving tokens of ‘proper respect’. ‘We are definitely peddling influence, but we don’t need to bribe people,’ he says of that period. ‘[These officials] can easily get a million, tens of millions somewhere else but they’re not asking them from me because they want to reserve their access to the Wen family for some other purpose.’ Their purpose, he says, was not traditional corruption, like government contracts, but tips for promotion or gossip on internal politics at the top of the party. As to the rights and wrongs of it, Shum largely suspended his judgment. At the time, ‘I very much [saw] myself as a student, trying to adopt what is the practice in China.’ What’s more, he felt that the system was getting better: ‘I was thinking I’m a participant in this betterment, I’m contributing.’ He was also getting very rich – or, at least, his wife was, since most assets were in her name. He says, ‘I get to a stage where I can own anything I wish.’ He bought a Ferrari and a private jet. He and Duan flew around the world to find the perfect $500,000 jade bracelet. They needed to prove to those of ‘noble birth’ that they, too, belonged. Shum won’t say how much he is worth now, other than saying he is ‘comfortable’. He claims he doesn’t miss being in the billionaire league. Once the novelty wears off, he says, ‘it’s just a normal part of your life… You realise it doesn’t mean that much.’ All this success and optimism culminated in the ultimate moment of hubris: Shum and others began to believe they could nudge the system in a more liberal, democratic direction. He started a charity to award scholarships to disadvantaged youth and set up a think tank to foster civil society. He didn’t realise it at the time, but this was the high point of China’s journey towards freedom. After 2008, everything changed. The route back to oppression How liberal hopes for China were dashed   2008 Beijing hosts the Summer Olympic Games at the high point of hopes for liberalisation, with China’s economy still booming 2012 Xi Jinping assumes leadership, begins a huge purge of the Communist Party and ramps up disappearances of activists and government critics   2018 Xi changes the constitution to remove the limit of rulership to two five-year terms, effectively allowing him to rule for life 2020 China’s new national security law in Hong Kong sparks protests. In China, disappearances reach an estimated 39-58,000 people For Duan, the fear of falling never fully went away. ‘You’re climbing a cliff,’ says Shum of her rise. ‘You dig your nails all the way into the rock.’ Duan had nothing to fall back on – no illustrious family, no foreign passport. She tried to plan for the future, cultivating not just the Wens, but several younger, rising officials. It wasn’t enough. In 2012, The New York Times published an investigation into the fabulous wealth of the Wen family, which named Duan, damaging her and them. Shum believes that the piece was a political hit-job planted by an enemy of Wen’s. The journalist, David Barboza, denies this and says he spent a year hunting down documents after hearing rumours about the Wens. Either way, after 2008, Chinese politics took an oppressive turn. The financial crisis convinced the elites that the Western model was nothing to envy and the Communist Party turned from liberalisation back to focusing on control and power. This shift facilitated the rise of an especially ruthless, authoritarian official called Xi Jinping. Xi, a son of the Maoist aristocracy, began his rule in 2012 with an ‘anti-corruption’ purge so extensive that Shum, who had at first supported the campaign, concluded Xi was making himself a dictator for life. ‘When you arrest that many people – you’re talking about 10 million people who are your enemies – you can’t step down. The moment you do, the backlash will overwhelm you,’ says Shum. So complete is Xi’s purge that Shum believes if the 68-year-old died tomorrow, there would be such a serious a power vacuum it could split the party. Shum became convinced it was time to pack up and move their lives out of China. Duan disagreed. In 2015, he left with Ariston. Within two years, Duan had disappeared. Despite his composure, there is a quiet anger to Shum. He and Duan devoted their lives to learning the rules of the game, building a business empire and developing China in the process. He clearly believes they operated as cleanly as possible. But in the end, that was no protection – they weren’t of the right ‘bloodline’ and in a system ruled by fear, no friends or allies were willing to help. &lt;img class=""responsive lazy-image__img article-body-image__source"" src=""/content/dam/world-news/2021/11/30/TELEMMGLPICT000241912579_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNHPnaojp5PseXVWAlSJjp5-sjRhQesoLpbbz3DnpHdo.jpeg?imwidth=480"" alt=""Chinese president Xi Jinping"" loading=""lazy"" width=""2500"" height=""1563""/&gt; Chinese president Xi Jinping swiftly cracks down on anything that might pose a challenge, jailing political rivals and silencing dissent CREDIT: Zhang Ling/Xinhua via AP   Now, Shum sees the Communist Party extending its power and influence around the world. Those who claim that the party may be benign or that we can engage with it positively are deeply misguided, he believes. ‘They want submission of all countries,’ he says. That means, for example, if a country won’t vote to install China’s candidate at the UN, it will be punished in another area, just as Australian trade was sanctioned for demanding an investigation into Covid. ‘Are you willing to live in that world?’ he asks. Fundamentally, the party sees the success of democracies as a threat. ‘As long as you insist on prospering and thriving, their model is not that great,’ he says. That is why Xi wants to ‘take out’ Taiwan and stamp out all talk of ‘universal values’. I ask whether China will become the biggest economy in the world, as trends suggest. ‘It won’t happen,’ he says immediately. But that hasn’t stopped China enthusiasts in the UK from pushing for closer relations. When Shum published his book, he sent it to several senior British politician friends. ‘They’ve never responded. They don’t want to associate with me – they still want to make some bucks in China,’ he says. Is he talking about people who are in government today? He hesitates. ‘Yeah,’ he says. ‘Sort of, yeah.’ Shum will never go back to China. But he has had enough of running and hiding. In his book, he describes how he was once among those Hong Kongers co-opted by Beijing to serve its interests: ‘We all went along with a system we knew was wrong because to do otherwise would have cost us – and everyone around us – their livelihood, freedom and who knows, even their lives. The price just seemed too high.’ It is a price that Shum has now decided he is willing to pay.

Be aware if they have any Chinese documentation they will be seen as property of the state and dual citizenship will not be recognized.

Among the hundreds of problems from food safety, both air and water pollution, education quality and values, vehicle safety, second hand smoke, etc etc etc please be aware as a foreigner you have no actual rights to your child. Piss off your wife, or forgive for saying but if something happens to your wife you will be at the mercy of her in laws, they will have legal precedence over you in deciding what happens to your children. You might find when push comes to shove the friendliness among family will dissolve quite quickly, especially with kids involved.  Last unsolicited tip, don't let the in-laws refer to themselves as YeYe or NaiNai, if they start that up you know you're already screwed.

It's not necessarily seeing it as wrong, it's more people being frustrated with the policy, as it essentially means you need to make a choice: Stay in China or Leave China. And it's not that easy a choice. Staying because you have a good career going or built your life here, also means not being able to travel to see your family for potentially several more years (it's already been 2 btw). Leaving means potentially being unable to come back for several years, and thus being forced to go back and restart your life and career.  This is in stark contrast with other countries, where travel has at least been made manageable for people who do wish to go see their family, even though there are still restrictions in place like vaccination passport, facemasks, etc. (depends on each country obviously).   Mainland China is by far one of the harshest quarantines you have to go through both in terms of time and cost. There's no consistency across the country either, with people having to do double quarantines, or in terms of quality of hotel.  So it's a subject ""wrong"". People sure understand why China may pursue zero covid as a strategy, but the sheer inconvenience that it's generated has made many people deeply frustrated.

All in all the “investigation” took over 9 months of my life. During that time it was hard to work, and bring in money. It was terrible. A slow burn on my finances. The lawyers were absolutely useless too. They said they can’t do anything during this stage because I was “officially convicted” I was in a weird legal grey area for 9 months of my life were I was being punished for a crime I never committed.

By Qiao Long and Emily Chan 2021-08-06 Email story Comment on this story Share Print story      Print     Share     Comment     Email  China Stops Issuing New Passports, Slaps Entry, Exit Curbs on Citizens A man is shown holding Chinese travel documents in a file photo. Reuters  China has stopped issuing new passports to its citizens and has imposed entry and exit controls on its population, citing the recent surge in the Delta variant of COVID-19, but commentators say the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is using the pandemic as a pretext to curb freedom of movement.  Chinese nationals living in mainland China have told RFA in recent months that the authorities have gradually stopped issuing new passports and exit visas -- a police-approved travel permit that adds another layer to a slew of hurdles Chinese nationals must clear in order to be allowed to leave.  The Chinese Entry and Exit Bureau recently confirmed publicly that the rules are in place, saying exit permits will only be issued for ""essential"" travel.  ""We will be implementing a strict approvals systems with no permits for non-emergency or non-essential trips out of China, to ensure public safety during the pandemic,"" spokesman Chen Jie told a news conference on July 30.  Some Chinese nationals living in the United States have been stranded in China after they combined a trip home with plans to renew their soon-to-expire passports at the same time, U.S.-based businessman Zhang Shengqi told RFA.  ""My friend ... found he couldn't get [a passport] after he got back, and his wife [in the U.S.] just gave birth to a child,"" Zhang said, suggesting that even returning to one's place of work and family wasn't being regarded as ""essential.""  ""My friend even has contacts in the area, but even they can't get it done for him; nobody is issuing them, so he is stuck there and can't get out,"" he said. ""It's pretty inhumane when families can't be together.""  Chinese nationals have also drawn a blank when trying to apply to renew passports at the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles, Zhang said.  ""There are a few people here whose passports have now expired, yet [the consulate] are saying that none of these applications are urgent,"" he said. ""They are refusing to renew them.""  ""They are planning to hire a lawyer and sue the LA consulate,"" he said.  Pandemic used as a pretext  Current affairs commentator Fang Yuan said the pandemic probably isn't the main reason for the new restrictions, however.  ""I think we can look at these new entry and exit restrictions in the context of the crackdown on Chinese companies listing in the U.S.,"" Fang said. ""These choices are being made in line with the [Sino-U.S.] trade war.""  ""These actions may cause some harm to [Chinese interests], but they are also hurting the other side,"" he said.  U.S.-based legal scholar Teng Biao said Chinese nationals should be granted the freedom to enter and leave China at will, under the constitution, Chinese passport law, and immigration legislation.  ""I think the Chinese Entry-Exit Bureau's actions are in violation of laws protecting the basic rights of citizens,"" Teng told RFA. ""The pandemic is being used as a pretext.""  ""They want to ... clamp down on the movement of their citizens and prevent Western ideological imports from influencing them,"" he said.

30,30,2,1631241546,"I have heard rumours of this a month ago. I used this reason to encourage my mother to apply for Canadian citizenship (she is a Chinese national, presently in Canada with a valid permanent resident card, but her Chinese passport expired a month and a half ago). But she is still very hesitant to do so, fearing that having Canadian citizenship would negatively affect her ability to sell her (worthless) Chinese real-estate holdings.  Unfortunately, Xi Jinping's attempt at Cultural Revolution 2.0 means separating China from the rest of the world and that includes gross infringements of human rights. Remember, in a normal country, regardless of your status, if there is not a warrant out for your arrest, you should be allowed to leave. That applies to both citizens and foreigners.  The rumour I heard is that if you are going to apply for or renew a passport for travel (for tourism purposes) or get a study permit (to study abroad), you will get refused. If you go to work, they will allow you to go ahead. The first 2 involve spending money and the third one involves earning money. People intending to immigrate may fall into the former group, as understood by the Chinese government. As for Chinese citizens who already have permanent resident status in another country who return to China for short trips, I am not sure if border officers will allow them to fly back to the country in which they have status. There are no news pieces I came across where Chinese officials ban overseas citizens from leaving to go back to the US/Canada/Australia/UK/New Zealand, etc... But at the same time, I would not be surprised if they start doing that in the future.  I am about to take the slippery slope argument to the extreme, and make the assertion that this is going to cause a massive international crisis that will destroy China's relationship with the West, especially the United Kingdom and Canada, and here is why.  If it is true that China is not issuing passports to citizens who apply for them, and being that both Hong Kong and Macau are parts of China, then China will make these governments to do the same to their citizens + permanent residents (people are only eligible for a passport there if they are both Chinese citizens and have permanent resident status in one of those special administrative regions). Beijing can change the 1997 explanation to Section 9 of the Nationality Act and ban dual citizenship in Hong Kong and Macau and force the existing dual citizens to choose between China and the other country. The basic principle of travel for a dual citizen is that you enter and exit a country using the same passport--specifically, if you are entering and exiting a country in which you are a citizen, use that country's passport. If you are a Hong Kong (Chinese) citizen and a Canadian citizen and you are in Hong Kong, your probably used a HKIC or HKSAR passport to enter. You use your HKSAR passport to leave Hong Kong when going through exit immigration but inform the airline that you have a Canadian passport. Prior to landing, you also provide proof of vaccination for COVID-19 on the ArriveCAN app (has to be Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca or J&amp;J and the last vaccination took place at least 14 days prior to landing). Upon landing in a Canadian airport, you present the data on ArriveCAN and your Canadian passport and are granted entry.  There were as many as 300 000 Canadian citizens in Hong Kong--a city of 7.5 million. Now, if China makes HK and Macau stop issuing passports so that Hong Kong residents who have Canadian citizenship cannot leave the island to return to Canada (a constitutional violation according to the Constitution Act of 1982 in Canada), then obviously, it would be hugely problematic. Presenting a Canadian passport to Hong Kong exit immigration may be tantamount to falsely confessing to illegal immigration (how did you enter Hong Kong and overstay your 90 day visa free access privileges as a Canadian citizen?).  The same kind of problem would exist for anyone with BN(O) passports. If someone has an expired HKSAR passport but a valid BN(O) passport and intend to immigrate to the United Kingdom may be banned from using BN(O) to leave the city.  /End rant",China,t5_2qh2v,/r/China/comments/pl57xo/china_stops_issuing_new_passports_slaps_entry/hc9ikle/

Train stations and hotels is about the only place this happens.   Once an inspector on the train got all difficult about it, I just insisted I arrived before the pandemic and he gave up and left me alone. Felt a bit embarrassed by it but no major drama.   The second time was a bit worse. I took a train from a small city that had some cases, I still had a green code though. When I arrived they were checking everyone who got off that train and my passport without a stamp wasn't in their ring binder I guess. After arguing to each other about how they were supposed to deal with me, they made me get a covid test at a little tent outside the station.

So there is a plausible argument that the CCP is restricting new travelers to stem a growing tide of political emigrants, in which case we would expect passport issuance to open up once a new system for screening outbound travelers has been established.  On the other hand, the US also paused passport issuance for a few weeks when Covid blew up last year because they needed to restructure to allow distanced work.

57,57,0,1615569054,"Right...  Well, [there's this](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/02/asia/xinjiang-china-karakax-document-intl-hnk/), a leaked Xinjiang government document, listing reasons why people were sent to camps. In some cases, it was religiosity, but ordinary religiosity, like going to the mosque (which is legal and run by the government of China) and saying daily prayers. But in other cases, it had nothing at all to do with religion: traveling abroad (or, paradoxically, NOT traveling abroad but holding a passport), having family members who were under suspicion, having family members who traveled abroad, having too many children, reading too many books. Men were taken for having beards. On that last one: some wumaos here have said that this is just China extending what it was already doing with the One Child Policy to Uyghurs, so nothing to see here, right? But as the article notes, Han women weren't generally jailed or sent to camps for violating that policy (as awful as it already was). Normally, the penalty was just a fine.  If you doubt the authenticity of this leak, consider this. While the Chinese government didn't confirm its authenticity, *it didn't deny it either*. Whenever they've been pressed on *specific examples* of leaked documents, they always refuse to ""confirm or deny."" You'd think that if it was a forgery, they'd be chomping on the bit, finding ways to expose it as such, and thereby embarrass the human rights community. Thus far, they have not. This article is from May 2020.  As for the second claim, I'll just refer you to any coverage of Xinjiang in Chinese state media, where it's claimed that of course, they are respectful of Islam and religious liberty. [Random example:](http://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202103/12/WS604ac246a31024ad0baaeb5a.html)  *China is a country ruled by law. The government cracks down on all kinds of illegal and criminal activities in accordance with the law, and the illegal and criminal activities carried out by using religion are no exception. In the fight against crime, there has never been a specific religion that has been targeted.*  So, that's your dilemma. Either it's the case that it's good that China is trying to stamp out Islam, in which case, you're accusing China of lying. Or, they aren't trying to stamp out Islam, in which case, your justification for the camps isn't sustainable. Take your pick.  As for your Curveball reference, this seems to be an example of the [""Media Got it Wrong Before"" fallacy](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Media_was_wrong_before). It's usually sufficient to merely point out that an argument is fallacious (in this case, the fact that media got something wrong before doesn't mean they are wrong in *this* case, which would require you to demonstrate how they're wrong).   But I'll go further. In the case of claims about Iraqi WMD, the sources media relied on were generally US intelligence agencies, who had a desired policy outcome, and allowed cognitive bias to read ambiguous data to favor that outcome. In the case of what we're seeing here, none of the sources are coming from the US, UK, German, French, etc. governments or their intelligence agencies. They're coming from refugees themselves, shoeleather journalists, independent researchers and data geeks, and leaked government documents. There also doesn't seem to be a specific desired policy agenda, mainly because there isn't much specifically that the US or other governments can do about this problem. With Iraq, there was a desired policy - war. I've yet to see any Uyghur activist or even the most militant of anti-China hawks argue for war with China. There seems to be some general consensus about using the Magnitsky Act against Xinjiang officials, boycotting goods that can be traced to Xinjiang, and boycotting the 2022 Winter Olympics. I've [seen a few argue](https://supchina.com/2021/02/11/asylum-for-the-uyghurs/) that the US should make it easier for Uyghur refugees to come to the US. But inventing an entire genocide out of holecloth for those modest policy outcomes seems kind of like overkill. It's just not plausible. If anything, what I'm seeing from China policy folks is a sense of frustration, in that it seems the reality of this genocide isn't something that they can ignore, as a matter of morality, but it's a major obstacle to working out diplomatic solutions to other issues that the US, Canada, UK, etc., would desperately like to resolve with China, particularly as the world economy recovers from the Covid crisis. And that tracks: reality doesn't always give us what we'd want or what would be convenient, and if anything, we should be more suspicious when it seems to, because that often means there's something we've missed. In this case, because this is very much something that no one wants, and no one benefits from, that makes more likely that the media is getting it right. I'll also note that, unlike reporting on Iraq, there doesn't seem to be any kind of partisan split there. Whether we're looking at far right sources (Breitbart), right-of-center (WSJ, Fox), moderate to center-left (CNN), leftish (NYT, Atlantic), to far left (Jacobin), the reporting has been pretty consistent on this. Whereas I could point you to plenty of media in 2002 that was highly skeptical of the case for the Iraq War. Thus far, the only media that seems to be supporting the case for denialism is Chinese state media.",China,t5_2qh2v,/r/China/comments/m35sp8/is_communist_china_losing_control_of_the_uighur/gqpj5nd/

They did not care to hear what I was trying to tell them, which was ""help me charge my phone so I can scan the code"" and ""I haven't left China in 4 years"". Long story short, they almost forced me to quarantine. I finally made a big fuss about it, screaming and yelling, and finally someone came to their senses and charged my phone. Once my code showed I never left, they all laughed it off and I was on my way. They're laughing but not a good experience for me.      There is a second situation that is borderline racist me and my friend experienced recently. I was taking my friend around to find an apartment to rent, and to note, we were always wearing masks. He's an ABC and hasn't left China for at least two years now. Once the landlords or security guards hear he's an American you can immediately see they become uncomfortable. The masks come out (they weren't usually wearing masks) and they take a few steps to the side. On at least three occasions the landlord actually decided on the spot not to rent to him. What we always did, and I feel we shouldn't have to, is explain to them that he's never left China.   I suppose we can consider ourselves fortunate because we are not white, brown or black. I can't imagine what someone of a different skin color is going through recently. I've seen pockets of how locals cover their mouths/noses with their hands because a foreigner is around. It makes my blood boil because imo I think they usually do it just to make the foreigner feel uncomfortable. If they're so confident to walk around without a mask then why use such big hand gestures when a foreigner is around?  Also, I've seen mothers do with their children what OP had described. It's appalling. If you can teach your children such negative sentiments towards foreigners then surely you can teach your kids not to urinate in front of the hospital entrances!

72,6,0,1628222246,"Cultural Revolution 2.0 is coming. There is a Chinese slang circulating on the Internet: “闭关锁国，关门打狗” (close the country's doors and hit \[kill\] the dogs). Xi Jinping is really Mao Zedong 2.0.  So, the Chinese government is really trying to make sure they are isolated. If you are a Chinese citizen in China, you will likely be banned from leaving (passport issuance in 2020 is down an astonishing 98% from 2019, from 16.5 million to just 330 000). If you are a Chinese citizen overseas trying to return, they make you isolate for 21 days even if fully vaccinated by a western vaccine (2 shots for Pfizer **or** Moderna **or** AstraZeneca **or** 1 shot for Johnson and Johnson) + 14 days. This makes a vacation to visit family impossible without extensive paid time off or outright termination from your job in the other country even if you are exempt from quarantine upon return to that other country. If you are a naturalized citizen in that country, you are prohibited from entering China because China has a one-citizenship policy (except for Hong Kong and Macau residents).  On the other hand, they are now promoting such extreme policies to make their citizens less connected to the international community (which severely hurts their economy because it makes any kind of international transaction much, much more difficult). They are wasting valuable time where the children can learn one of the most widely used languages on Earth, and indoctrinating them with extreme cult-of-personality statements (just like they did in Mao Zedong's time). According to my mother, in school, they kept having to praise Mao (whereas I did not have to keep praising Hu Jintao when I was in school and he was president). Within generations, China will regress into the way it was 60 years ago, which is exactly what it doesn't need, because it is already facing imminent collapse due to population decline pressures.  No wonder, the Hong Kongers saw this coming to them. In 2020, according to the Education Bureau, a whopping 15400 students dropped out of school in Hong Kong (out of 705000 students), which is to say that more than 2% of students who attended school in 2019 are no longer doing so. Why are students dropping out? Of course, their parents are taking the kids out of school, quitting their jobs, selling their homes and cars, and using the money to buy a one way ticket to Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States to start their new lives. This is before the British government started allowing British National (Overseas) passport holders to resettle in the United Kingdom. This number will be even more horrifying in 2021 when the data comes out in August 2022.  Honestly, I feel very scared for my nieces and nephew (the children of my first cousins) in China. Their country is doing things that will transform them into crazy people and I think that with this kind of indoctrination, they may grow up and come to view us (my mother, my sister and her son) as ""enemies"" to be hated just because we live in Canada. The other thing: the fact that my sister's son (a native-born Canadian) speaks Cantonese better than my cousins' children pisses me to no end.

78,12,0,1620773022,"However, it does not make getting a PU letter any easier. Only if you take a Chinese vaccine will they expedite your application. I heard that they also only accept proof that you took a foreign vaccine to prove why you have have excess anti-bodies in your system upon arrival. Because you would fail the Covid test. Also, I don't think they include foreign vaccines in the vaccine passport either.

79,13,0,1620475143,"Have heard of a few adverse reactions, mostly fatigue, but have not heard of any deaths.   I got the Sinovac vaccine about a month ago, and will get my second dose in June. Similar to what hapigood said, it was an easy process, the line to get it wasn't even that long or slow. In my case, I requested the vaccine through my school, who simply called the nearest vaccination point and told them we would show up, and that was it. Went there with my passport and nothing else, got the shot after 30 minutes or so, waited for another 30 minutes in a room, and then left. Most Chinese people I know have also gotten their first shot at least, usually through work (Jiangsu) or direct sign-up (Shanghai).  I haven't seen anyone receive Sinopharm yet, but I have seen a three-shot vaccine (CHO) being given out at times; couldn't tell you how, where, or what the decision to give out Sinovac or CHO is based on though.",China,t5_2qh2v,/r/China/comments/n7jk7i/talked_with_a_chinese_friend_about_the_sinovac/gxdnumf/
80,14,1,1620480481,There is no word from my uni about foreigners being able to return. It depends whether they can get enough of the population vaccinated before the summer. I believe they want 40% of the population vaccinated by July and maybe they will open the borders then. But word has it that they are struggling to meet that target. They will also have to officially recognise the foreign vaccines too in their system. Because they are already introducing their own vaccine passport system. The Green QR code has a gold ring around it if you get the Chinese vaccine.,China,t5_2qh2v,/r/China/comments/n7oroo/how_likely_is_it_to_have_foreign_students_in/gxdvtcg/

Your university however may have no clue until the last minute.  hapi's crystal ball, which is rarely wrong, suggests you'll need some sort of vaccine passport, though details on that have not been worked out and should be by June or July.
