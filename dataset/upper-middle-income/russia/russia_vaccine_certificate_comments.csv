1,0,1642486056,"Hello! Keep an eye out for vaccine regulations! Many museums (all pretty much state run) in particular will only let you in if you can present your QR code when vaccinated with Sputnik only.   The tourist certificate is easy, just google russian tourist invitation and you'll have heaps of companies who do it. All online, takes 10min to fill in your bits and it's sent to your email to attach to your tourist application form. All costs around 30eur maximum.",russia,t5_2qh75,/r/russia/comments/s61a0x/tips_for_solo_russia_travel_in_march_2022/ht58bu0/

3,0,1638548876,"You really need some historical context before you can call Russia's actions aggressive.  There's nationalism on both sides and above that there's the global politics that is a large wedge driven between the two countries.  If anything, Russia is simply demonstrating that if Ukraine wants to talk like an independent nation it should also expect to be treated like one.  Ukraine is always begging the West for more weapons and money and bad mouthing Russia, yet they cry if Russia threatens to withhold gas.  Let's not forget it was the Americans that appointed all the politicians in Ukraine after the revolution.  Victoria Nuland is on tape! It's all theater, and Russia is merely matching Ukrainian rhetoric with action.  And the funniest part is, not one serious analyst in the world predicts the West will have any military response to any Russian action in Ukraine.  They know the Russians are not playing the same petty politics as them, and they respect that at the end of the day.  Anyways, nothing will happen in all likelihood. Europe has enough problems, the real news is the rise of a medical police state.  I was just in Budapest and you guys wear maks almost as religiously as the Asians.  Couldn't even enter a sauna without a vaccine certificate!   Beautiful country but totally fallen to the EU technocracy.  Hope you can keep Orban in power !",russia,t5_2qh75,/r/russia/comments/r82gw4/what_would_russia_gain_from_invading_the_ukraine/hn30hwj/
4,0,1638380913,"Okay so native Russian friend got back to me, that place requires a passport with either work permission or temporary living permission, which I don't think tourist visa's count as. They are closed for tonight but I'll write them an email and have a friend try and contact them tomorrow. Special living permission is apparently a different document that tourists do not receive.      So far its seeming as I feared: there is basically no way for a foreign tourist to get a QR code without PCR tests. I'm happy to have my mind changed, however.
