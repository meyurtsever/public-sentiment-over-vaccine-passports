18,18,0,1639604000,"‘Germany is an immigration country’: Scholz sets out future vision Chancellor Olaf Scholz set out his vision for Germany under the coalition government, underlining the need for transformation when it comes to the climate, modernisation, immigration and integration.  Scholz held the floor in the Bundestag on Wednesday in a two-hour speech in which he set out the new government’s plans for the coming four years.   The lengthy speech – which is a traditional fixture for incoming German governments – was his first address since he became the ninth chancellor of Germany last week, taking over from Angela Merkel who was in office for 16 years.   Touching on overarching themes of respect, solidarity and support for everyone in the country, Scholz showed his Social Democratic colours throughout.   But he also hammered the home the fact that things were going to change in the coming years. He talked about a transformation in the way businesses and people go about their lives as the country aims to do as much as possible to protect the climate.   Scholz also called for solidarity and for people to get vaccinated to combat the Covid pandemic.  READ ALSO: Germany will ‘defend itself against anti-vaxxers’, says Scholz  Here’s a look at some of the points Scholz touched on in his wide-ranging speech.  Immigration and citizenship  As The Local has been reporting, the new German coalition government is planning an overhaul of the immigration system and citizenship processes.  We’ve been looking at this theme in detail because it affects to so many of our readers – most of whom are foreigners in Germany themselves.   “Germany is an immigration country,” said Scholz as he addressed the Bundestag. “It’s high time we understand ourselves. Therefore it’s high time we make it easier to become a German citizen.”  “It is only on this basis that we can make full integration and political participation possible.”  (article continues below)  See also on The Local:  Scholz said the new German government plans to make citizenship possible after five years in Germany – reducing it from the current eight years.  The coalition plans also state that this could be reduced to three years in the case of special integration achievements.  There are also plans to relax the current strict rules on holding more than one citizenship. This would be beneficial for non-EU nationals who – on the whole – are not granted more than one passport if they apply to be naturalised in Germany.   “We’re going to make multiple citizenship possible, which is in keeping with many people in this country,” said Scholz, adding that it will allow people to hold the citizenship of their country of origin as well as German citizenship.

Photo: picture alliance/dpa | Kay Nietfeld Scholz said the coalition planned to enact a new immigration law. The coalition has said there are plans to introduce a points-based system of immigration to attract more skilled workers.  The new government also wants to streamline processes.   “It will be easier for immigrants to find jobs in Germany,” said Scholz in the Bundestag. “Educational qualifications from people coming from abroad should be recognised more easily.”  Climate, modernisation and business  In the fight to slow down climate change, Scholz told people in Germany that there would be far-reaching changes.   The phase-out of fossil fuels must be accelerated, he said. By 2030, 80 percent of electricity demand is to come from renewable sources. “This means that the biggest transformation of our industry and economy in at least 100 years lies ahead of us,” said the Chancellor.  “The prosperity of our country depends on our ability to build the infrastructures for the climate-neutral age.”  In general, he said, the coming years would be about modernising and investing in many areas – from charging stations and wind farms, to digitalisation and administration.  There is no point in “saving against the crisis”, said Scholz underlining the need to invest in the changes the country needs.  READ ALSO: German cabinet agrees €60 billion climate investment plan  He talked of a “new era” in Germany’s digital path.  “Germany has to come back to the top of the league in terms of digital infrastructure,” said Scholz. “And for that reason we will invest in future technologies.”  On the subject of financing, Scholz said that spending would be put to the test and there would be a crack down on tax evasion.   Scholz, however, did attribute a big role to the economy and promised “super write-offs” in 2022 and 2023 for investments in climate protection and digitalisation.  Innovative companies are also to receive further tax benefits, and the development bank KfW is to play an even stronger role, Scholz said – perhaps an influence from his coalition teammates, the business-friendly Free Democrats.  Scholz said the government hopes to make Germany the leading European location for startups.  Equality, respect and wages  Scholz underlined the need for equality in society, touching on class and gender differences.   He said the minimum wage hike would be an important step for this.

In principle, the following are allowed to enter the country  German nationals and their family members of the nuclear family (spouse, unmarried minor children, parents of minor children). EU citizens and citizens of Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Norway and Iceland and their family members of the nuclear family (spouse, unmarried minor children, parents of minor children) Third-country nationals with an existing long-term right of residence in an EU or Schengen state and their family members of the nuclear family, provided that the passport and visa regulations are fulfilled. In addition, entry is permitted to:  Persons resident in third countries such as the United Kingdom may only enter Germany if they perform an important function, their journey is imperative (see on this ""When is there an imperative need to enter?"") or if they are fully vaccinated (see on this ""What applies to fully vaccinated persons?""). A person is resident in a state if he or she is either domiciled or habitually resident there. Residence is established in particular if the last 6 months have been spent there.*   For entries of family members, see also ""What special features apply to the entry of family members from third countries"".  Travellers must present a negative Covid-19 test, proof of genesis or proof of vaccination before entry. A maximum of 48 hours (PCR test 72 hours) may have elapsed between test collection and entry.

Travellers with a carrier (aeroplane, bus, train) must already present the negative Covid-19 test or proof of vaccination before departure/departure.  *The decision as to which documents are accepted as sufficient to prove residence is a decision of the Federal Police.

The parents, as Americans, are not allowed to mail in the registration paperwork and are not allowed to make an appointment because appointments were not allowed during this time period.   A few weeks later, American parents are transferred to Leipzig for work. Baby is still not registered with the birth office. Parents are then called back to the US of A because work contracts were bought out and are given two weeks to get paperwork and get on an airplane.   Parents FINALLY are able to make an appointment to get baby recognized as being born and make the long journey by train from Leipzig to Stuttgart. Oh, wait, mother’s divorce was finalized while mom was pregnant. They had been separated for 10 years and mother had not spoken to her ex-husband since then (American military benefits for being married, long story). This ex-husband is the ONLY MAN that could be recognized as the father and the only way to register baby is with his signature. He’s living in the USA somewhere unknown and mother is told he MUST fly to Germany to sign a piece of paper saying he is not the father.   After some crying, office girl lets mother sign the paper and we will just ignore that the baby has a father. Immaculate conception or some such other. But, baby must have ex-husbands name on the paper. Whatever. We need the piece of paper. She is able to get it to us the next day.   Cue requirement to take an overnight train to Berlin to go to the American consulate to get a passport. We’re down to having three days to leave the country. Apparently, both parents are required to sign for a passport for the baby to leave Germany. The recognized father will never be reached. They then said we would need to amend the birth certificate.

Was told then not to worry. Mother just needs to fill out a form online stating this and submit it to the consulate. Done and done. Passport achieved. Oh, wait. Mother has to go to an office in Berlin to state they wouldn’t come back to Germany without the recognized father of the baby. Done.

This is already happening, only question is how vaccines administered outside of the EU fit into it: https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate_en  &gt; Do you know of many Europeans who have gotten their jab outside of Europe? How are they able to provide proof of their vaccination?  I do know several citizens of EU countries who've been vaccinated outside of the EU.  That said, virtually no one I know has traveled back to the EU very often.  The one person I know for sure who's traveled did so before the idea of proof of vaccination being a ""major thing"", and so still had to get a negative PCR test and all that.  &gt; The documents they were given were accepted at the border when they returned. So I am hoping that the CDC card will be good enough once the borders are open again.  Realistically, with such disparate vaccination systems and how people got jabbed and the massive push to get people vaccinated and ""we'll worry about the finer details later,"" toting around paper and sending in proof of vaccinations from other countries will wind up being a thing that happens.",germany,t5_2qi4z,/r/germany/comments/ns7ejx/entering_germany_with_proof_of_covid_immunization/h0mvcbs/

So of course every doctor is free to give you a second shot and by the time your second shot is necessary, the vaccine supply in Germany should be sufficient that you should have no problem getting this shot.  If this half Canadian, half German vaccination can be recognised for some sort of official vaccination passport is a different question. But frankly I wouldn't worry about that. Once infection numbers are low enough, everything will be opened up for everyone anyways and vaccination status won't matter any more. It will probably only be important for a short transition period, that might already be over before you get your second shot anyways.  And in any case: get vaccinated if you can. Don't worry about the bureaucracy, that will surely work itself out somehow. Just make sure you get protected as soon as you can. Not doing that would be mad.

72,72,0,1620649954,"Im a German Australian dual citizen that migrated here to Germany 2 years ago for work. I had never worked or lived here permanently up until that time, however my family is German and lives in Germany - it was just my father who migrated to Australia ( lol obviously ) and i thought i had it sorted (fluent/passport/connections etc ) before i got here. If you are brave to read on and do not take this personally, please read on...   Nope. Nooooo i was wrong! WRONG!   **BTW-This is a** ***""general observation"",*** **there are lots who are not like this but i am struggling to find them. My first year here in Germany was hell on Earth for the below reasons. To put in context, i inadvertently moved to one of the most racist towns in Niedersachsen and just happened by a stroke of bad luck to live ontop of an AfD psycho woman...**  I found ""Germans"" to be passive aggressive, rude, obstructionist, cold, inappropriately opinionated, always blaming others for their mistakes or faults and always trying to find a ""weaker"" person to take out all their insecurities on. Yet at the same time, being more ""woke"" and self righteous than they deserve credit for...and then ramming it down everyone elses throat ( esp if you are foreign ). It was so bad in the first year that i almost went back to Oz!  Despite my fluent language skills, education and experience and the fact that i was INVITED by a German multinational company to work for them, i am treated like an uneducated, dumb idiot who is always trying to ""cheat"" the ""real Germans"" out of &lt;insert random topic here&gt;. Or the cause of &lt;insert recycling/parking/noise complaint here&gt;, despite being a quiet and boring person and capable of following German instructions  (im 42 for crying out loud! )  Allegedly i am always ""lying"" if there is not a German born person with me to verify ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING i say, even when they cannot speak English and have no idea what i need or  even if they need to be there. Which mostly, they dont!! For example, I am a cancer survivor from about 5 years ago, the Hausartzt wanted my partner to verify this, despite us only being together and knowing each other 2 years and him never having left Germany or able to speak English...oooookay. Because my English medical documents were allegedly ""not enough"", they need my German plumber boyfriend to confirm.  I have a German partner (the plumber) who claims to not know one word of English (no problem-o!) but still uses my ""foreignness"" to blame or accuse me of something as a course of a ""misunderstanding"" to explain his deliberately rude, manipulative and sometimes embarrassing behavior  ( dont even get me started on his ""elite"", toxic, racist family ).  I noticed Germans do not like fresh fruit or vegetables unless it is vacuum packed in glad wrap but then lecture and dictate to everyone about saving the environment and wastage.  I noticed lately that i am being ""flight shamed"" as i would like to visit my father who refuses t come back to Germany, in Melbourne - when the border reopens. I am ""killing the environment"" by needing to catch a plane and i should be ""ashamed"".  I noticed Germans cannot handle change. At all. Even down to catching COVID because they NEED to go on that Austrian ski holiday regardless of pandemic, war, famine... global warming...  My Super-German Plumber Partner gets upset when i wear ""foreign clothes""..that means jeans, a t shirt and little thongs with butterflies or something that is normal on the beach in Oz...on the Ostsee...nope my clothes are ""not normal and i should go and change before he gets embarrassed and wear some real German woman clothes, so a militant mountain hiking pants with some angry masculine button up shirt that is too tight with very very small breast implants, a deep voice, a cigarette hanging out of mouth and dragging her kids with Kindergeld and husband by his balls to get an ice cream because she says so..."".  I noticed that Germans cannot handle anyone with a difference of opinion (esp Politics ) so if there is ANY opinion from me, i am labelled a Nazi and automatically voting for AfD ( i am Jewish too, unbelievable ).  Australia is a multicultural country in its true-est form,(compared to anything i have seen in Europe ), so i find the constant mentions of my foreign background in the negative absolutely shocking ( i was even blamed for the spread COVID 19 by my work colleague because she saw that Australia was in ""Asia"" and then made 1 +1 = 27.5 )  Germans do NOT get irony or black humour. ""punkt"". However i was happily proven wrong recently by a new colleague who is just the funniest guy ive ever met, AND he is full German and married to a Brazilian because he takes issue with German women and some behavioural ""norms"" that are frankly unacceptable to most people.   In saying all of this ( sorry if you are still reading this ) i have met lovely Germans to, and after a bit of ""argey bargie"" , are totally fine and okay...which seems to be necessary to establish to the German person that not only can i speak the language, i can also....READ!!!! I DONT FEEL I SHOULD HAVE TO ARGIE BARGIE WITH ANYONE... ARRRRGHHHHH!  I miss Oz and fresh fruit and veggies. I miss being able to cook Thai green curry and not have people in my house making vomiting sounds or comment on some aspect of it being foreign food and thus, inedible as i do not ""Germanize"" it. I miss being Jewish and not have people find that insulting or a dig at German war history. I miss thongs. I miss swimming without having my body critiqued by a lipo-sucked, itty bitty German tittied middle aged demented blonde Heidi reject with a flat wrinkly arse and unwanted inappropriate opinion on feminine ideals...   I miss just walking into a shop/office/situation where i did NOT have to give a lengthy family history of why i have a German name and not being a ""real German"".  However, it IS very cool to find cups and pens and stuff with my name printed on it, as my name doesnt exist in the Aussie lingo bandwidth. Which is totally okay...but..

With that you earned the status “fully vaccinated” = you can access 2G establishments.  -	January 2021 - J&amp;J downgraded. You lost the status “fully vaccinated” = you cannot access 2G establishments.  -	22 January 2022 - you receive dose 1 of mRNA. You gain back the status “fully vaccinated” as of 22.01. = You can access 2G, but **not 2G+** without a test.  -	22 April 2022 - you receive dose 2 (booster) of mRNA. You receive a new certificate valid as of 22.04 and gain the status of “boostered” = you can access 2G+ without a test.   Does that make sense? Your first mRNA dose will be treated as your second Covid vaccine and bring you to the status of “fully vaccinated”, just like those who needed 2 doses of BioNTech / Moderna. Then after 3 months, you go get your 2nd mRNA dose (“first booster”) and you get all the benefits associated with it.   You will receive a new certificate tomorrow with the “expiration date” of 22.09.22.

Similarly I expect that we will soon stop accepting the Janssen vaccine as proof of anything because all the data says that it simply isn't good enough against the new virus variants. We already recommend anyone who got the Janssen vaccine to get another mRNA jab within four weeks. I assume we will make that mandatory soon. So in all likelihood you would end up needing two shots anyways. So you might as well get two shots of mRNA in the first place, which offers better protection against the virus.

Therefore the checking apps are not sure what's the case and show ""not valid"". Other apps, like the CWA, which could find out the difference if you have all your certificates imported therefore also show them as invalid.  Your advice is good practical advice for all those affected by this. Just show your first certificate until 14 days after the booster, because the people who check the certificates will go by what the checking app says (if they don't have QR readers built into their eyes, like most servers seem to have nowadays).

My idea of a nice holiday is somewhere cold, clean, has lots of good restaurants, nice for shopping and pedestrianised. I'm gonna be taking time off work so I want to enjoy the city in a relaxed way, kinda like what the locals would do if they were off work. Not a big fan of the big touristic attractions in any place I visit. I'm the kind of guy that skipped the louvre museum in Paris, the London Eye, etc.   Is there a chance that shops, parks and restaurants will close early or that restaurants will stop dine-ins..?   And will I have difficulty if my vaccine passport is not an EU vaccine passport (My vaccine passport is certificate which comes from our ministry of health and is on PDF format: it's got my name, dates of each dose + name &amp; batch number of the vaccine + where i took it, and it has a QR code for online verification).

On the phone they asked us if we were vaccinated, and we said we were.  But when we got there, and the place was packed, nobody checked. A harrassed server waved us vaguely in the direction of our table. This place, by the way, has two rooms, a balcony, and a large patio.  It took *ages* before our order was taken, and more *ages* before our food arrived.  Well, here's why all of these things happened: they were seriously short-staffed. We got talking to the owner: he was happy that at last he could re-open properly, and that at last he could hope to make a little money in the last few months of the year. But he couldn't afford to pay enough servers (because, you know, the pandemic has hit his business hard), and one of his regular staff was off sick, so there was a grand total of three people, including himself, working the entire restaurant. He simply couldn't afford to have somebody on the door with a non-existant scanner (not every business has them, what a surprise) checking every single person's vaccine certificate and ID card. As we arrived they were closing the patio and balcony, but were still rushed off their feet.  Basically, in this case, the response from the manager when we talked to him was: ""Yes, but how?"" And: ""Everybody wants to work from home and eat out now, but nobody can tell me where I'm supposed to get the staff.""  It's hard to know what to do in these circumstances. We're not going back there until the whole pandemic thing is over. The last time we ate out, it was at our village pub: they do at least visually check the certificates, and since this is a village where everybody knows everybody else they don't need to check that our names match our IDs because they already know our names.",germany,t5_2qi4z,/r/germany/comments/qs35dg/we_need_to_start_complaining_to_managers_when/hkb20z1/

In the countryside people tend to spend their free time at the private houses of their friends and neighbours so there is not so much need to show a certificate all the time.  - And especially Saxony and Thuringia had the highest rates of infections last winter and hence the highest rate of recovered people.

198,106,0,1628792201,"&gt; How much time would that be then?  Most likely months and up to a year. We are not talking about an extreme minority of ideologues that will never change their minds.   &gt; Anyway, I don't give a fuck what people are or aren't thinking or what their intentions might be.   You may think like that, of course, but that's not how you design policy. You cannot manage people without their consent for long, eventually they will rise up and turn against you, after being radicalised by extremists. There's a reason we prefer pluralistic democratic systems of government. Broad participation and a sense of your concerns being considered brings more political stability.   Germany has a vaccination rate of around 65%. Let's round that to 70% for those who are still waiting for their second appointment date to come, like yours truly. The remaining 30% are not anti-vaxxers. At worst, only the remaining 5% is. You should be wanting to win that 25% over, instead of gifting them to the 5% of extremists. You may be fed up with their indecisiveness, but it will be worse for everyone if due to social pressure they are convinced that the extremists were right and that the government is indeed out to get them.   &gt; Was the person given plenty of opportunity to act? Obviously yes, even now. It's not like you have to start paying for tests tomorrow.  They were not given understanding. Their fears have been ridiculed, and their concerns caused by bad science communication by politicians (like the horrible smear campaign against the AstraZeneca vaccine) has not allowed them to act. And while there have been attempts to make up for the mostly bad science communication, tribalism has strongly taken hold. Vaccinated people are cutting off unvaccinated friends, and vice-versa. People either bribe for fake vaccine certificates, or get their vaccination done in secret, all to avoid social stigma and expulsion of their group. This is a public health disaster, especially when it comes to fake vaccine certificates (it's a social cohesion disaster for the inverse case).   &gt;  I'll reserve that for people actually suffering, be it from falling ill, from loosing loved ones or from being driven into utter exhaustion. Since all of that can be prevented or at the very least significantly reduced by vaccination, empathy is actually a pretty good reason to get vaccinated. Essentially, you're calling for more empathy for people who are demonstrating a lack thereof. Just no.   So long as you continue excluding the middle, we won't get far. I am not recommending that you to empathise with extremists.  &gt; That would be the case, if there's any harm done. It isn't though, when the thing you need to do to avoid unwanted costs is entirely to your benefit.   Modern science and medicine learned for mistakes of the past and values informed consent extremely highly. Our domestic and international legal systems also reflect our moral values. The legality of making those who cannot afford the less invasive medical practice that serves the same purpose as the more invasive medical practice spend a disproportionate amount of their income in order to preserve their right to choose doesn't look like it will hold up in courts, but it remains to be seen. The ethical case is pretty clear cut though.   &gt; So what? Many vaccines only offer temporary protection, that's entirely par for the course. I simply fail to see any argument there. ""Eventually I'll drown anyway"" isn't a valid argument against learning to swim.   That is only addressed towards the people who advocate for exceptions for the vaccinated. If you don't advocate for that, and it seems like you don't, then disregard it.   &gt; d like to point out, that this country has had mandated vaccinations in the past and with the blessing of the BVG.   Mandatory vaccinations have their place, including with regards to SARS-CoV-2. Medical necessity and legal proportionality must be applied though. The issue is indirect *universal* vaccination, which is a radical concept for comparable diseases.  &gt;  If the comparatively soft approach of making life a little more expensive and inconvenient for the terminally stubborn doesn't produce the desired results, I'd have zero troubles with going down that road again.  Excluding the middle again. I think we won't be able to meet halfway in this argument if you refuse to accept that most people who aren't vaccinated yet aren't ideologues.   &gt;  How is anything conditional upon anybody's level of wealth, when the vaccine is entirely free?  The ability to *make* the choice to consent to the vaccine is conditional to your wealth. If you make 3000 EUR per month and you don't want to get vaccinated, then the ~240 EUR per month for a low estimate of 2 tests per week is an amount of money that sure, you would miss, but you could afford for as long as you wish to. If you are someone like me, who makes 1000 EUR per month, 240 EUR is almost the money I have left after paying my fixed expenses. If I wasn't sure I want to be vaccinated, I would be forced to take it without being able to offer informed consent (or seek a way to get a fake certificate for an one-off cost and/or come into contact with large groups of people in ways that bypass status verification and contact tracing).   By taking away the free tests for the undecided, you create those two classes: those who can afford them continue to be tested. Those who can't afford them either put them and everyone at risk by going underground, or have their bodily integrity violated because of their status as low-earners.   &gt; If you're a bus driver and refuse to do something about your failing eyesight, it's entirely on you that your choices provide your employer with grounds for termination. How's that different to somebody whose work includes close contact with the vulnerable refusing to get vaccinated?   See above for specific professions and mandatory vaccinations. Yes, we can make a solid case for mandatory vaccinations in medical environments, care homes, and probably in schools too. That is exactly because we know that in those environments the risk is extremely high and that runaway chains of infection were common and disastrous, and other measures proved ineffective. On the other hand, it is utterly disproportional to fire BVG drivers if they don't get vaccinated. Closing the front door of the buses and making inspectors wear FFP2 masks proved more than enough to make their role in spreading the virus negligible.   To use your example, when you are a bus driver with failing eyesight, your employer has no moral or legal right to force you to undergo a more invasive procedure like laser surgery, if wearing glasses or contact lenses (less invasive procedures) are more than enough to correct your vision to normal.",germany,t5_2qi4z,/r/germany/comments/p2l91g/germany_to_stop_paying_for_virus_tests_for_people/h8on7jp/

This is a good overview about where you can currently get vaccinated compiled by RBB, the local public news station: [https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/thema/corona/beitraege/2021/11/berlin-brandenburg-impfzentren-impfbusse-impfstellen-landkarte.html](https://www.rbb24.de/panorama/thema/corona/beitraege/2021/11/berlin-brandenburg-impfzentren-impfbusse-impfstellen-landkarte.html)  Besides those places of course lots of doctors do vaccinations in their practices and you might find an appointment through the platform Doctolib or just call and ask at a doctor's office near you.  Mind you, Germany is in the middle of the booster campaign right now so everyone is scrambling to get a booster shot, which means most places that offer vaccines are completely booked and you might need some luck to get a regular appointment. But you can always just queue up at one of the Impfstellen listed in the RBB article.",germany,t5_2qi4z,/r/germany/comments/r7tujs/how_to_get_a_corona_vaccine_as_a_foreigner/hn1pbo8/

I got Pfizer for both of my vaccines before I left (one in ON and one in BC), but my 14-day inoculation period didn’t finish before I left, so I still had to get a negative test. The WHO yellow booklet that another user mentioned isn’t something we’ve really used in Canada, so just bring physical copies of your vaccination records from the province when you fly over. The records should show:  - Your full name - Date of birth - Vaccine name - Lot number - Date administered  I was asked at my departing airport, all layover airports, and at Frankfurt airport to show my negative test (in your case, they’d ask for your proof of vaccination). I can’t stress this enough: BRING MULTIPLE PAPER COPIES OF YOUR RECORDS. Airline staff and German authorities all asked for physical records.  Regarding the question of mixed vaccines, you might want to reach out to the German missions (embassy/consulate) that service your province. They can tell you if you should contact another department like the Bundesgesundheitministerium (health ministry) or the Robert Koch Institute (the department who manages the risk countries list).  Depending on how long you’re here, you might want to look into getting digital QR codes to certify your vaccines. I brought my vaccine records to a local apotheke (pharmacy) here in Berlin and asked them to issue me digital QR codes for my records. The pharmacist asked me a couple of questions about why the forms didn’t seem “official” (no stamps or other pieces that German documents usually have to seem formal). Once I showed my passport and health cards with personal info that matched the certificates, and explained that Canadian records generally don’t have stamps or other seals like German documents, he went ahead and issued the digital versions for me. I was able to show those digital versions at a club here later that day with no issues. While paper anything is seen as generally preferred here, you might get additional questions like I did about their authenticity, so having the digital QR codes that were issued by the German system gave me peace of mind (plus it’s easier than carrying paper forms in my pocket when I go out).

But doctors can prescribe the vaccine just like any other medicine, so they can vaccinate absolutely anyone who asks for it, but depending on your insurance you might have to pay out of pocket.  2. The hoarding isn't necessarily the problem. That's just natural and any government not doing this would probably be chased out of office with pitchforks by a population desperate to get vaccinated. Is it fair? Of course not, but that's capitalism for you.  The real and easy to solve problem is that we are also still holding the patents and not enabling everyone to make as much vaccine as they can. Again: welcome to capitalism. Basically we are offering up the population of poorer countries on the altar of Biontech, Pfizer and Moderna being able to make shitloads of money in the future off other medicines using mRNA technology.  3. They're simply necessary if we want to get out of this thing. And no, they're obviously not more discriminatory than, say, driver's licenses. Only people who have proven that they are not a danger to others are allowed to drive a car. In the end the vaccination passport is the exact same concept.
