While you work in Australia you will pay income tax on your Aussie pay. You also have to file with the IRS, but there is a tax treaty between the US and AUS so the tax you paid in AUstralia offsets your US taxes. Also, there is a Foreign Earned Income Credit that you may qualify for if you are outside of the US for the requisite amount of time.  Once you have been in Australia long enough you can apply for PR (permanent resident) status. The advantage of this is that you are then covered by Medicare in Australia. The consideration to keep in mind with PR is that once you obtain PR status, you can no longer take your Superannuation out in one lump sum if you move back to the US until you are no longer PR which is about 4 years if memory serves. Also, while PR you still have to apply for a return visa every 5 years. Turns out the cost of that visa was nearly as much as applying for Citizenship.  Once you reach the time requirement for citizenship application (again 5 years I think but check the immigration website) you submit your application packet. Birth certificate, marriage certificate, children’s birth  certificate(s), certified copies of passport, etc.  When your packet has been approved, you will go for an interview and take the 20 question multiple choice test. Once you get your letter that your citizenship is approved, you are restricted from traveling overseas as you don’t have an Aussie passport (you cant get it until after the ceremony). Once you have your ceremony you receive a certificate that has your immigration number that you need to apply for your passport.  The whole process can take a couple years due to covid lockdowns, etc.  As far as what changes…you get your Aussie passport obviously, also you are required to register to vote and are required to vote or be fined. You can work in some government jobs that require citizenship. Other than that, not really a lot changes.

44,0,1632221637,"&gt; This entirely depends on whether a business decides (or afford) to effectively implement these restrictions. It is to be noted that the vaccine hesitant demographic overlaps with Australian business owners too. I certain business is just going to see a boost of patrons instead.   Yes, some businesses will not take the rules as seriously. Thats ok. This has been accounted for. You really only need a few checkpoints to convince a large number of people. In terms of affordability, the alternate is to stay shut down or operate at reduced capacities until the virus is safe - this is a lot more harmful for businesses. For example, you can no longer enter canada, US, and several countries in Europe without a covid 19 vaccination. This alone will incentivise a lot of people into getting jabbed. The approach is that we start strong, reach a high enough number at the start so we can live normally, a slow rollout will only make it harder in the future.  &gt; The health advisors have not made any clear scenario as to when this virus will stop posing public health risk to my knowledge. If I remember correctly, Dr Chant has suggested to familiarize with annual shots to be able to live with COVID.   Good, you seem to be understanding the nature of the problem. It is a new disease. It is hard to manage and predict. PCR testing is intrusive, double vax + boosters are annoying, lockdowns suck etc. We arent doing all this for fun. We are literally racing evolution of the virus vs human medical and scientific ability and trying to save as many lives as we can along the way. It took a couple of years for the spanish flu to evolve to a point where it wasnt a concern due to herd immunity + evolution. In australia, we have no herd immunity at all. Hence we are at the very early phases of this journey. It sucks. There are currently 10 other covid vaccines being developed. We hope there is a better solution in the coming months/years, and those that want to wait for it are welcome to do so. However, the rest of society needs to move on.  &gt; In NSW, the current restrictions aren't supposed to lift before 70% double dose vaccination. The trend is indeed towards 70%, or hopefully 90%, but I will be surprised if the vaccination reaches beyond that.  &gt; Lockdowns for the masses is easier to enforce than lockdowns for the unvaccinated. The vaccine hesitant demographic needs to be given an effective incentive, I just don't think the current implications are more than superficial.   Yes, at 70%, you can be sure that 70% of all voting adults have shown support for the government, the health advice and the vaccines in the country. Sure, this incentive may not work, but we have to try something. It is a new virus and a new world. America is trying something new too, they are mandating everyone in a company with over 100 employees. Maybe we will do that next. The question then becomes what is the ""right incentive"" instead of ""do we need incentives"". With each incentive, we cover more and more people.  &gt; A lot of people are in for vaccine passports, and while that is a good idea in paper, I highly doubt the effectiveness in practice. Society has lived without vaccine passports just fine. I cannot think of a way to generate the feasibility to enforce vaccine passports. Many people do not use a smartphone. Many people are not eligible for Medicare. Many people are medically (legally) exempt from this vaccine. Many business cannot afford extra manpower to check vaccination status. Many business owners are against COVID vaccine based segregation. Not many businesses have been asking their patrons to produce a proof of vaccination against other contagious diseases. I don't think the trend is changing very soon. If the government were to provide the citizens with a vaccination ID card, probably that would help but I can imagine many people are against putting medical/geological data into their phone because of privacy concerns. The QLD police department has already misused the check-in data and set a precedent.  Cool, its a new experiment and we shall see the results. We have new technology that has never existed before to try and get this right. Maybe it will lead to some standardisation and some digital progression in society. We dont ask for a proof of vax against other diseases because they arent a problem in society at the moment and we have learnt to live with them. That hasnt happened yet for covid, it will one day. One day the vax passport will be useless, maybe in a year, maybe longer. You can get a proof of vax on paper, you dont need a smartphone. I agree there is a privacy concern, and thats where we hope that the data isnt misused. However, having a smartphone alone with any social media app effectively destroys your privacy.  &gt; Agreed, and they are free to get the vaccines to ensure their safety.  There are people in the population (somewhere around 2-5%) who can not get vaccinated due to medical reasons. Additionally, breakthrough infections are possible. Kids also can not get vaccinated. Vaccines are not a 100% effective. So even if someone does everything right, they are at a small risk of Covid. It has been studied that transmission is higher in unvaccinated populations, hence it is safer to minimise the unvaxxed pool. Additionally, customers of that business have a right of safety within a business venue. Unvaxed workers and patrons may pose a risk, hence harm minimisation comes into play again.  &gt; Because people's appearances can change over the years. Eye and mental health can deteriorate etc. I cannot draw a correlation of this to the topic. If you are talking about getting a COVID booster shot, the FDA has adviced against it for 65 and under in the US after examining that Pfizer vaccines can pose a risk of cardiac issues.  Maybe my point did not come across well. The primary purpose of a drivers license is proof that you are safe to drive on the road. You may have perfect eyesight, be young and healthy, have 10 years of driving experience and are driving on a clear empty road. However, the law still asks that you get an up to date drivers license. We are not going to create custom laws for each niche subsection of society. The social contract does not care if you are a race car driver or an 18 year old who just got a car. We have put in another checkpoint to try to minimise risk.  In regards to boosters, they are a new phenomenon and are being studied. If you are going to quote a government advice, please also note that all scientific and government agencies around the world are encouraging all adults to get vaccinated. The vaccine has risks, but currently covid has more, hence why the push for vaccinations. One day this will change, but we havent hit that point yet.  &gt; You cannot achieve that in a non-tyrannical government. Some people are cautious and forcing vaccines into them is a breach of human rights.  No one is being forced. There are people over 90 who still havent taken a single dose of any covid vaccine in australia. People will still have access to the essential services and be able to live their own lives in ways that minimises risk. If you are cautious, please dont take the vaccine, feel free to wait and to consult a few GPs. If you get a medical exemption, great, if not, just wait at home till there is a solution for you. However, to participate in the broader society means giving up some rights. You have to drive the speed limit, you have to vax your kids, you need to pay tax and you need to be jabbed to enter certain venues.   At the same time, we as a society have determined that we dont want dangerous substances (poisons, drugs, etc) around children, we dont want guns in the wider community, we dont want people to say or spread hate speech. All these things infringe on some level of human rights. You are allowed to complain about them, but you must also realise that we as a developed country have collectively made a decision on these things. If you can gather support for your cause, great, take it to parliament and change the decision. Alternatively, go somewhere else if the social contract is unacceptable to you. This focus on every compromise being referred to as ""tyranny"" is counter productive. The government routinely tells us what we can and cant eat, how fast or slow we can drive, what we can and cant watch, the things we need to do to own pets, the shots our children need, the standards our work needs to follow, etc. There is a balance in society, sometimes it wont be to your liking, thats ok, there is a system to change it, but that doesnt make society tyrannical.",australia,t5_2qh8e,/r/australia/comments/ps58z8/coronavirus_megathread_b1621_counts_lockdowns/hdpc0ie/

48,0,1631858936,"&gt; The 'quality of life' statement was in response to your assertion that the world thinks we're lapdogs, rather then involvement in the wars. Who cares? We still live a good life, one of the best in the world by almost any measure.  Yeh and I have no idea why you think our quality of life is a relevant idea, by any measure, in this regard. Is the logic that it's fine for us to be and be seen to be the pathetic lapdog of America just so long as it secures our quality of life? Because of some hypothetical future bogeyman, some massive threat to our land and people, for which we will need U.S. support? Because I don't value a quality of life that comes at the cost of being a gear in an aggressive imperial machine just because of a vague and questionable future threat. And ironically a threat which, to the extent that it is realistic, is actually made worse by the ways we've joined the U.S. in interfering with the world; a threat which, to the extent that it is realistic in the first place, probably could have been entirely mitigated, I think, by a constituting of our economy, Defence capabilities, and foreign policy around a principle of neutrality.  &gt; This theme you keep repeating that the world resents us... doesn't really seem to be the case. Pre-covid, we had one of the strongest passports, and people usually seem happy to receive our visitors.  Yeh, I agree we're well-liked in interpersonal terms and that's a reflection of what the average Australian who travels around the globe is like; it's a very different thing from the posture and impact of our foreign policy. And the ""strength"" of our passport is mostly in places that share strong cultural ties or with whom we have a strong economic ties (tourism).  Resentment and anger are key driving forces behind atrocities like 9/11. And in that regard, we are a target. It's pure luck that it hasn't, so far, eventuated into a major, large-scale incident on Australian soil.  &gt; You have a niche version of 'national interest' that is wholly based around Australia being entirely neutral and not getting involved...  Yes. Because it seems like that would have served us (by which I mean all Australians) better, on balance, over the last century. One of the reasons for that is because I think it would have given us more trust, moral authority, and leverage in acting as a mediating, neutral middle power. And I think it would have proved massively beneficial to all Australians to have geared our economic development and foreign policy posture and Defence strategy around such a role.  &gt; ... even in the defence of smaller nations getting slaughtered.

Because it's futile when it's so clear that a great many of these bloodbaths are directly enabled by the specific meddling or general economic and political machinations of us and our allies (like the U.S. and Suharto).

An expansive community of business owners across the state say unvaccinated people will be welcomed despite State Government regulations which will restrict access to venues to double-vaccinated patrons.    Last month, NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro revealed businesses will need to prove all staff and customers are vaccinated in order to open to the double-jabbed public when the state reaches 70 per cent in October.        Deputy Premier John Barilaro during the COVID-19 update in Sydney. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Dylan Coker    The Deputy Premier warned businesses and unvaccinated customers would face “significant fines” if they are caught at a venue without being vaccinated.    A Controversial jab or no jab Facebook page dedicated to the NSW Hunter Region has seen thousands of people promoting “pro-choice businesses” once the lockdowns are lifted.    ‘Newcastle, Hunter and Port Stephens businesses welcome jab or no jab’ is encouraging businesses across the region to continue to serve their customers regardless if they are vaccinated or not.    This article contains content that is only available in the web version    Open the web version    With more than four and a half thousand members, businesses are promoting their services online to support the cause.    “Jab or no Jab, you are all welcome to be pampered in our relaxed environment. I look forward to seeing everyone real soon,” the owner of **Studio 77 hair and beauty in Rutherford** commented on the page.        Businesses will be forced to check customers are vaccinated during the QR code check in. Picture: NCA NewsWire / Nikki Short    **Full Throttle at Beresfield** also chimed in, “Good BBQ never discriminates. Everyone is welcome.”    Two pubs in the Hunter Valley have also shared their intentions of “accepting everyone”.    The iconic **Ellalong Hotel** vowed to accept all walks of life into their pub.    “We don’t care if you are vaccinated or not vaccinated, if you are fat, thin, tall or vertically challenged, gay, straight, white, black, hot or down right ugly or even a dragons supporter. We welcome all,” it said on its Facebook page.    “United we stand – divided we fall. Save Australia. Some things are worth fighting for,” continued the post.        The Ellalong pub in the Hunter Valley has promoted that it will welcomed people who are unvaccinated. Credit: Facebook    It garnered more than 150 comments, with a majority congratulating the pub for their stance.    “First place I’m going for a feed,” one person said.    “What a fantastic, inclusive business,” another person commented.    While some were cautious of the statement.    “Pretty much guarantee the police will be there upon opening checking vaccine certificates, if you’re not vaccinated no entry,” they said.    Meanwhile, **The Caledonian Hotel in Singleton**, which put a giant banner out the front promoting ‘Free Australia’, has also joined the ranks of businesses wanting to invite everyone, including those without the jab.        Caledonian Hotel at Singleton will welcome those with a jab or not. Credit: Facebook    “The Caledonian Hotel under the Australian constitution 1901 will abide by all law and will never discriminate against anyone,” it said on its Facebook page after refusing to speak to “mainstream media”.    “Everyone is welcome at the Cali! Kind regards management Calendonian Hotel,” it read.    Newcastle MP Tim Crakanthorp said it was disappointing that there are people out there who would choose to put others at risk, but cited confusing information.    “Businesses making these decisions for themselves shows that there is a large information void coming from the NSW Government about how they can operate on reopening,” he said.    “There should be no room for interpretation in this Public Health Order, and businesses need to be given plenty of notice as to what their rights and responsibilities will be.        Newcastle MP Tim Crakanthorp said it is disappointing people are putting others at risk.        Charlestown MP Jodie Harrison believes the message to businesses is confusing.    Meanwhile, Member for Charlestown Jodie Harrison agreed the message to businesses are confusing.    “I’ve spoken with small businesses who are concerned about their liabilities if they enforce, or don’t enforce, vaccination,” she said.    “They are after very clear information and certainty from this government.”    The Deputy Premier said he was “not interested” in Facebook pages criticising the public health orders.    “You don’t have to open at 70 per cent, no one if forcing you,” he said. “But if you choose to reopen, it will be under the parameters of the public health order.    “Under Work Health and Safety legislation, employers have the responsibility to keep their staff safe — and in this case, safe from Covid.”        NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro speaks to the media during a COVID-19 press conference. (Photo by Bianca De Marchi – Pool/Getty Images)    Mr Barilaro said there would be “fines for people who do the wrong thing” however, a set amount for the infringement had not been determined by the NSW Government.    “First point of clarification is what do fines look like in relation to regulating it, and what are the mechanisms we put into businesses.    “I don’t want to put any more onus on business owners — if I don’t feel comfortable that businesses have the ability to turn away customers and enforce the rules, then I don’t want to punish businesses for that.    “Most businesses owners will not have an excuse to say that they didn’t check the QR code because there is already an obligation to do so.”    The Deputy Premier also revealed businesses in regional settings could be used to trial the vaccination passport as part of the QR code check in system.    The breaching of public health orders currently imposed by the NSW Government results in a maximum penalty of $11,000, or imprisonment for six months.    While on-the-spot fines of up to $3000 can be issued to people breaching the orders.    However, NSW Government regulations say the penalty for businesses increases to $55,000 for a breach of public health orders, and a further $27,500 penalty may apply for each day the offence continues.

59,4,1631262618,"In the case of COVID it's a false narrative. We've already seen that the vaccine won't prevent you from getting COVID (or transmitting it), therefore there's no such thing as ""herd immunity"".   For normal vaccinations (which you can call an immunisation, because it makes you immune to the disease), having a certain percentage of the population immunised is a good thing because it will eradicate the disease.   This will not happen for COVID.   So, getting vaccinated is a good idea for your own protection, but it won't help anyone else.   Yes, a ""percent of the population vaccinated"" will lessen the strain on hospitals, but if you're going to force that then why not target smoking, obesity or alcoholism as well?

61,1,1631120637,"So let’s have a look at the article.  First of all, the tone - it’s obviously a “OMG LOOK AT THIS” sort of op-ed nonsense where they had an opinion (“the decadence of the west belies their authoritarian nature”) and then wrote 500 words to back that.  &gt; The role of ‘Big Nurse,’ Kesey’s tyrannical antagonist, who has an arsenal of medication at her disposal, would go to Australian health chief Dr. Kerry Chant. This medical authoritarian recently informed the 8.1 million locked-down subjects of New South Wales that Covid will be with us “forever” and people will have to just “get used to” rolling up their sleeves for endless booster shots.   Dr Chant is the Chief Health Officer of NSW, not the Australian health chief.  The position that covid will be with us “forever” is not an uncommon one among health chiefs.  &gt; Chant’s grim assessment of Australia’s future faced no challenges from other professionals, which should come as no surprise, since the act of expressing medical second opinions – a ‘luxury’ that doctors have enjoyed since at least the Middle Ages – has been [outlawed](https://au.news.yahoo.com/facebook-post-lockdown-protest-11000-fine-080358345.html?guccounter=1).   Nothing has been outlawed, of course, the linked article says:  &gt; As Covid-19 case numbers continue to surge in NSW, the State Opposition wants tougher, targeted public health orders to crack down on anti-lockdown rally organisers and viral social media spruikers.  &gt; The State Opposition is calling for harsher penalties to crack down on anti-lockdown rally organisers. Source: AAP  &gt; These include $11,000 fines for people sharing information on social media about illegal rallies and inciting others to illegally attend.  &gt; Under the plan, protest organisers would be slapped with whopping $20,000 fines.  &gt; Unlawful attendees would face fines of $5,500, an increase from the current $100  The opposition called for fines for protesting…that’s not a law, it’s a press release, and it’s about being a cunt, not “getting a second opinion”.  Back to your article.  &gt; While few would find fault with Chant’s wry observation that “we want diseases to be totally eliminated,” it is the total absence of democratic procedure in this wild goose chase that is alarming. After all, it was Dr. Chant who advised citizens in the heat of summer not to “start up a conversation” with others in public spaces – a wonderful excuse to keep the populace squirming under the heel of bureaucracy.   What democratic procedure is lacking?  The democratically elected government of NSW is acting in accordance with the laws of NSW.  &gt; In the next chapter of this Keseyian tragedy, Australian leaders are passionately signaling – virtuously, of course – that the only way to escape from creeping medical apartheid is for everyone to submit to the jab.   Yes, first mention of apartheid.  +1000 clicks!  &gt; “There is going to be a vaccinated economy, and you get to participate in that if you are vaccinated,” Victoria Premier Dan ‘Big Brother’ Andrews informed a roomful of puzzled and muzzled reporters. “We’re going to move to a situation where, to protect the health system, we are going to lock out people who are not vaccinated and can be.”  Ah, so vaccines will be maybe required for some things?  So like the UK’s hilariously shitty [covid passport](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-58475147) scheme for nightclubs and maybe much more?  Or like Canada’s one for [international travel](https://www.reuters.com/world/canada-planning-covid-19-vaccine-passport-international-travel-2021-08-11/)?  &gt; Aside from ‘ape-shit crazy,’ there is really only one way to interpret that incredibly disturbing remark: either you agree to submit to a vaccination, or the “vaccinated economy” will be closed to you. Now, whether that lockout will only apply to the bread and circuses that make up Victoria’s vibrant cultural scene – nightclubs, concerts and sporting events, for example – or to the more indispensable venues, such as grocery stores and medical clinics, the Dear Leader would not say.   Ah, so nothing has been announced, so let’s assume the worst, and make a North Korea reference to…the democratically elected Premier of Victoria.  Right.  Anyway, it’s all like this - just nonsense with lots of strong adjectives and really weirdo references.  RT is a propaganda arm of the Russian state, so this is exactly what they do - troll the world in a really heavy handed fashion.

There's a [process](https://www.health.gov.au/sites/default/files/nip-vaccine-listing.pdf) to have certain vaccines added to that list.

111,0,1628671906,"The old guy hasn't been well behaved either:   &gt;  Byron Bay’s patient zero is a Sydney businessman with convictions for drugs, burglary and forgery who immigration authorities once claimed had arrived in Australia on a false passport. Zoran Radovanovic, 52, successfully fought a government bid to cancel his visa and send him home to Yugoslavia with the Administrative Appeals Tribunal finding he had a capacity to make a contribution to Australia. NSW Police on Wednesday charged him with breaching public health orders after he allegedly travelled from Sydney to the Byron Bay area without a reasonable excuse in contravention of public health orders. He is in Lismore Base Hospital being treated for Covid having travelled to the Byron Bay area with his two children, who have also tested positive to the virus. He has been served with a Future Court Attendance Notice to appear at Lismore Local Court on Septemebr 13. His criminal history was revealed in the AAT in 2000 when he was given the benefit of the doubt and the “finely balanced exercise of discretion” to remain in Australia with his wife Tiana MacDowell, against whom he has recently been accused of breaching a restraining order taken out by police to protect her. He has made regular appearances before the courts in relation to a series of domestic violence charges. In 2018 he pleaded guilty to two separate counts of common assault and two separate counts of contravening a restraining order and was placed on a good behaviour bond for 12 months, ordered to complete 100 hours of community service and fined $500. Most recently he was charged with destroying or damaging property and breaching a restraining order taken out by police to protect Ms MacDowell. He will face a hearing over the destroying or damaging property charged in Downing Centre Local Court on October 28. The family recently moved from their home in Woodside Grove, Frenchs Forest on the Northern Beaches which they sold for $2.25 million and moved to Rose Bay. In February 1992, he was convicted in Melbourne’s Prahran Magistrates’ Court of two counts of burglary, theft and theft of a car. He was sentenced to six months’ jail on each charge to be served concurrently. The sentences were suspended for 12 months. He told the AAT that he was not guilty but took the advice of his then-lawyer that “it would be quicker and cheaper to plead guilty”. Immigration documents show he left Australia on March 1, 1992 with Tiana MacDowell, who had changed her name from Tijana Simic. They cleared customs at the same barrier and were cleared by the same custom’s officer but Radovanovic denied having left the country and returning on a false passport as alleged by immigration authorities. “Movement records do not show that the applicant re-entered Australia after March 1 1992 by the name Zoran Radovanovic,” the AAT said in a judgment handed down in Melbourne in 2000. In April 1998, immigration officers and police, acting on information he was in Australia unlawfully, raided the St Kilda flat where he lived with Tiana and as they searched for his passport, they found about 40 young marijuana plants. He was convicted at Prahran Magistrates Court of possessing cannabis, growing cannabis, using cannabis and forging a birth certificate. Radovanovic claimed he had last seen his passport two years earlier and he was not sure whether it was lost or stolen, the AAT said. He was refused a bridging visa in May 1998 but was later granted a visa on various conditions including that he leave in June 1998. He married Tiana in July 1998 and he applied for a permanent residency on spouse grounds. Again this was refused which is when he appealed to the AAT. In his time in Australia, Radovanovic has lived in Lightning Ridge under the name Zoran Cuk, according to the AAT decision. In overturning the decision to cancel his visa, the then-AAT deputy president B M Forrest said he believed witnesses who said Radovanovic lived in Lightening Ridge during the period immigration authorities said he had left the country. He said he was prepared to “accept as a probability” that he did not leave Australia and return on a false passport while not rejected evidence of immigration records or accepting Radovanovic’s evidence “unequivocally” “I have considerable reservations about his evidence,” the AAT said. “Only he (and probably those closest to him) know the truth of events and I am not convinced that he was being candid in his evidence about matters which he perceived may have been to his disadvantage to disclose. Such an approach does little to instil confidence that a person has the inherent qualities of good character. “I regard the applicant’s evidence of his passport being either lost or stolen as unconvincing.” Mr Forrest said despite finding he did not “pass the character test”, there was evidence of his good character. “Having considered all of the evidence and submissions and the matters required ... to be taken into account, the competing considerations for the exercise of discretion are finely balanced,” the tribunal said. “I have come to the conclusion that the balance falls ever so slightly on the side of an exercise of discretion in favour of the grant of a visa. “",australia,t5_2qh8e,/r/australia/comments/p24lae/police_to_charge_sydney_man_who_sparked_covid19/h8ii4o1/

While it's undeniable Australia's overall death rate has been very low compared to other developed nation of a similar size, and here's where I get downvoted, Australia paid for it's low numbers with government responses that would not be tolerated by many populations in the developed world - from restricting freedom of movement, to creating a temporary prison locking in migrants ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-08-25/coronavirus-melbourne-public-housing-tower-shutdown-inquiry/12589372](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-08-25/coronavirus-melbourne-public-housing-tower-shutdown-inquiry/12589372https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-08-25/coronavirus-melbourne-public-housing-tower-shutdown-inquiry/12589372)), to implementing outbound travel bans even for foreign citizens and foreign residents becoming the only country other than North Korea to do it ([https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-06/covid-rules-australians-overseas-visit-home-change-exemption/100356366](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-06/covid-rules-australians-overseas-visit-home-change-exemption/100356366)), to being investigated by the Human Rights Commission for not allowing passport holders home ([https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/apr/16/un-urges-australia-to-act-quickly-to-bring-stranded-australians-home](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/apr/16/un-urges-australia-to-act-quickly-to-bring-stranded-australians-home)), to outright declaring the use of an Australian passport a criminal offense ([https://time.com/6047130/australia-india-covid-travel-ban/](https://time.com/6047130/australia-india-covid-travel-ban/)), to using the military on the streets when public health measures failed and actually thinking using the military is best placed to handle healthcare ([https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/2021/07/07/military-covid-australia/](https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/2021/07/07/military-covid-australia/)).  &amp;#x200B;  Any one of these measures would have caused rioting where I am in Europe and in other free nations as the governments were reluctant, for better or more likely worse, to allow a public health issue erode fundamental things like human rights and freedom.

However, a 95% vaccination rate in the rest of the population is enough to suppress any outbreaks in those diseases and virus'. This is what people are talking about in regards to hitting 80% (or whatever) covid vacc rates. As it stands Australia is sitting at 15.something% for both doses of covid vaccine. Maybe when we get to 95% we can talk about not needing a domestic covid vaccine passport.   And we already have what is effectively a vaccine passport, it's called an Immunisation History Statement. Everyone has one. You have one somewhere unless your parents lost it or threw it out. I guess these days it's a digital file with the Dep't of Health. The difference is that everyone gets multiple doses of these vaccines before they're 20. For example, by the time you're 16 you've likely had 5 or 6 doses of the diphtheria vaccine.  These multiple doses provide a lifelong protection against these illnesses. The point of a new vaccine passport, statement, record... call it whatever you want, is that nobody received multiple courses of a covid vaccine throughout their childhood and have no protection.

126,1,1627233643,"The pandemic response we have seen is ramshackle and often confusing as it doesn't seem to achieve it's stated goal of stopping the circulation of the virus and protecting the vulnerable. Until you realise that this was never the purpose. The response has, since the beginning of 2020 been designed simply to divert attention from the blame that our respective governments rightly deserve for the situation we find ourselves in. After all, had our governments been able to distribute the masks and implement the protocols that our longstanding pandemic response strategies outlined from the start, all of this could have been avoided.  As funny as the tagline here is, the government is actually trying to control the people. As an australian who has been in France throughout the pandemic, of course with an eye always towards the events unfolding back home, it has been difficult for many to understand a lot of the initiatives that have been put in place.   The french pandemic response being a more clear example of exactly what is about to unfold in Australia I would point out that everyone in France was perplexed when they told us that wearing masks wasn't useful for members of the general public. The dogs in the street here cocked their head sideways and mumbled in confusion when the government told us that children in school wouldn't spread the virus to their family members. We all rolled our eyes with exhaustion and bemusement when the government decided to implement a 6pm curfew in lieu of an actual confinement, a measure which would last for ten months when everyone knew after considering it for 10 seconds that such a measure would make peoples' lives miserable (those who worked weren't even able to buy groceries as the shops were forced to close before the average worker could get to them) and the measure clearly didn't work to stop the virus.  Why!? People exclaimed. For ten months people pulled their hair out listening to pandemic updates while crammed halfway into a stranger's armpit on the one train that EVERYONE IN THE CITY now had to climb aboard to get to and from work. We spent 10 months surrounded by people, but isolated from our friends and loved ones. The virus spread.   The answer is control. In France the government opted for a curfew that wouldn't work at all in place of a confinement which would have worked a little bit because they were concerned about popular criticism and losing their grip on power. The crisis for our governments is entirely a crisis of control. As we approach our third covid season Europe is in a state of upheaval. Protests against a health passport which will deny people access to hospital care and authorize their bosses to fire them without access to welfare, a health passport which mandates the vaccination of children as young as 3 or threatens their exclusion from kindergartens, schools and daycare centers. All of this in France is a hideous and calculated threat and an attempt to force people into being vaccinated, not to satisfy any particular health objectives  (our hospitals are increasingly filling with fully vaccinated citizens and doubts are surfacing about the ability of vaccines to prevent hospitalisation) but to force the population to comply, and to appear to have taken a strong initiative by harassing children and young people to receive a vaccine which is globally in short supply and ostensibly of limited use to them. Meanwhile 5million elderly and vulnerable french people have not yet been able to receive a vaccine and many others require a booster for the ones they received earlier this year.  We are two months away from another covid season and the government has done nothing in real terms to prepare the nation for what is to come. All they have done is cultivate fear and division in order to control people.   Yes it's true that the Australian government is incapable of organising an adequate hotel quarantine system, the Australian government is incapable of upholding their duty to citizens who have been desperately trying to return to their homes, some of whom have died waiting to be allowed back, yes the Australian government is incapable of organising a vaccine rollout, but that's because none of these things have been their main objective.

128,0,1625498069,"&gt;Why can't we just get a vaccine fucking passport stamp already?  What and do something?   If you bored read this:  Today the European Commission is proposing to create a Digital Green Certificate to facilitate safe free movement inside the EU during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Digital Green Certificate will be a proof that a person has been vaccinated against COVID-19, received a negative test result or recovered from COVID-19. It will be available, free of charge, in digital or paper format. It will include a QR code to ensure security and authenticity of the certificate. The Commission will build a gateway to ensure all certificates can be verified across the EU, and support Member States in the technical implementation of certificates. Member States remain responsible to decide which public health restrictions can be waived for travellers but will have to apply such waivers in the same way to travellers holding a Digital Green Certificate.        Vice-President for Values and Transparency, Věra Jourová said: “The Digital Green Certificate offers an EU-wide solution to ensure that EU citizens benefit from a harmonised digital tool to support free movement in the EU. This is a good message in support of recovery. Our key objectives are to offer an easy to use, non-discriminatory and secure tool that fully respects data protection. And we continue working towards international convergence with other partners.”        Commissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, said: “With the Digital Green Certificate, we are taking a European approach to ensure EU citizens and their family members can travel safely and with minimum restrictions this summer. The Digital Green Certificate will not be a pre-condition to free movement and it will not discriminate in any way. A common EU-approach will not only help us to gradually restore free movement within the EU and avoid fragmentation. It is also a chance to influence global standards and lead by example based on our European values like data protection.”        Key elements of the regulation proposed by the Commission today:        Accessible and secure certificates for all EU citizens:    The Digital Green Certificate will cover three types of certificates –vaccination certificates, test certificates (NAAT/RT-PCR test or a rapid antigen test), and certificates for persons who have recovered from COVID-19.    The certificates will be issued in a digital form or on paper. Both will have a QR code that contains necessary key information as well as a digital signature to make sure the certificate is authentic.    The Commission will build a gateway and support Member States to develop software that authorities can use to verify all certificate signatures across the EU. No personal data of the certificate holders passes through the gateway, or is retained by the verifying Member State.    The certificates will be available free of charge and in the official language or languages of the issuing Member State and English.    Non-discrimination:    All people – vaccinated and non-vaccinated – should benefit from a Digital Green Certificate when travelling in the EU. To prevent discrimination against individuals who are not vaccinated, the Commission proposes to create not only an interoperable vaccination certificate, but also COVID-19 test certificates and certificates for persons who have recovered from COVID-19.    Same right for travellers with the Digital Green Certificate –where Member States accept proof of vaccination to waive certain public health restrictions such as testing or quarantine, they would be required to accept, under the same conditions, vaccination certificates issued under the Digital Green Certificate system. This obligation would be limited to vaccines that have received EU-wide marketing authorisation, but Member States can decide to accept other vaccines in addition.    Notification of other measures – if a Member State continues to require holders of a Digital Green Certificate to quarantine or test, it must notify the Commission and all other Member States and explain the reasons for such measures.    Only essential information and secure personal data:    The certificates will include a limited set of information such as name, date of birth, date of issuance, relevant information about vaccine/test/recovery and a unique identifier of the certificate. This data can be checked only to confirm and verify the authenticity and validity of certificates.    The Digital Green Certificate will be valid in all EU Member States and open for Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway as well as Switzerland. The Digital Green Certificate should be issued to EU citizens and their family members, regardless of their nationality. It should also be issued to non-EU nationals who reside in the EU and to visitors who have the right to travel to other Member States.        The Digital Green Certificate system is a temporary measure. It will be suspended once the World Health Organization (WHO) declares the end of the COVID-19 international health emergency.        Next Steps        To be ready before the summer, this proposal needs a swift adoption by the European Parliament and the Council.        In parallel, Member States must implement the trust framework and technical standards, agreed in the eHealth network, to ensure timely implementation of the Digital Green Certificate, their interoperability and full compliance with personal data protection. The aim is to have the technical work and the proposal completed in the coming months.        Background        To comply with the measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus, travellers in the EU have been asked to provide various documents, such as medical certificates, test results, or declarations. The absence of standardised formats has resulted in travellers experiencing problems when moving within the EU. There have also been reports of fraudulent or forged documents.        In their statement adopted following the informal video conferences on 25 and 26 February 2021, the members of the European Council called for work to continue on a common approach to vaccination certificates. The Commission has been working with the Member States in the eHealth Network, a voluntary network connecting national authorities responsible for eHealth, on preparing the interoperability of vaccination certificates. Guidelines were adopted on 27 January and updated on 12 March, and the trust framework outline was agreed on 12 March 2021.        Today the Commission adopted a legislative proposal establishing a common framework for a Digital Green Certificate. The Commission also adopted a complementary proposal to ensure that the Digital Green Certificate is also issued to non-EU nationals who reside in Member States or Schengen Associated States and to visitors who have the right to travel to other Member States. Separate proposals to cover citizens and non-EU citizens are necessary for legal reasons; there is no difference in treatment of citizens and eligible non-EU citizens for the purpose of the certificates.        The latest information on coronavirus measures as well as travel restrictions provided to us by Member States are available on the Re-open EU platform.",australia,t5_2qh8e,/r/australia/comments/ociw5u/a_mild_level_of_suffocation_australians_overseas/h44vxxb/

132,2,1624587564,"No. The idea that you are ""innocent until proven guilty"" is not only harmful, it's not even how our judicial system works.  To start with, it assumes that ""innocent"" or ""guilty"" are the only two options. At the least, courts don't find you innocent, they find ""not guilty"" - explicitly not absolving you of all crimes. But even before the verdict, we treat people differently.  Let's suppose two people, Alice and Bob, go out for a night on the town. While quite drunk, Alice allegedly assaults a police officer, who charges her with a crime which will now need to go to court to determine if she is guilty or not guilty. Whether the police officer's statement is fact or a fabrication based on a misunderstanding or even personal vendetta is not yet known. Bob makes it through the evening without assaulting anyone - as he is definitely innocent, we'll use him as our control to see if Alice is treated the same as an innocent person.  The police officer does not arrest Bob, but does arrest Alice and takes her to the station, despite her protests that since she hasn't been proven guilty she must be treated as innocent and allowed to go free.  Having made bail, Alice is released into the community. She packs her bags, grabs her passport, and heads to the airport to buy tickets to Morocco. Coincidentally, Bob is also at the airport, preparing to board the same flight.  Bob boards the plane with no issues (we'll assume COVID isn't a problem in this scenario) and arrives in Morocco for his holiday. Alice, however, is stopped by customs, arrested again, and subsequently remanded in custody until her trial, despite her protests that as she is ""innocent until proven guilty"" she should be allowed to have her freedom and go on a holiday.  It's clear that we aren't treating Alice the same as Bob. She's been charged with a serious crime, and the way society treats her is different from how it treats an innocent person.  It is *also* different from how it would have treated a guilty person - she was not thrown straight into imprisonment nor was she immediately fined. This is the heart of what the expression ""innocent until proven guilty"" is getting at: that you should not be subjected to the punishment for a guilty conviction before you have actually been found guilty. It does *not* suggest that you be treated as innocent.  If someone is accused of a crime, they are not legally ""innocent"" - they merely have not yet been found guilty. While legal *punishments* are not yet applicable, legal *procedures* may apply that are different from those not accused of a crime.  Investigations by the police or other authorities are *not* a legal punishment. Scrutiny by the media is *not* a legal punishment. Mockery on social platforms is *not* a legal punishment. These are all legitimate things to do legally, and the concept of ""innocent until proven guilty"" does not apply here.  Saying someone committed a crime is also *not* a legal punishment - though it may constitute a legal offence in the form of defamation if it can be proven to be false. Further, if a jury is found to have been unjustly swayed by fervent public opinion, the court may rule a mistrial. For *those* reasons, we should be careful about not getting carried away in our public forums. But the suggestion that the accused should be free to go about their life as though innocent is both unrealistic and illogical.",australia,t5_2qh8e,/r/australia/comments/o6xxal/christian_porter_rape_allegation_documents/h2y8biy/

Now, another reason people leave is because they are not able to find employment in their field in their homeland. Scientists in Australia, for example, have no real industry to turn to and thus need to work abroad to gain employment outside of a competitive University system. This is typically due to poor governmental policies which focus on short-term gain at the sake of long-term investment. Look at how we needed to import COVID vaccines and outsource CSL for vaccine manufacture. The vast majority of science graduates in Australia will have a degree that was paid for with HECS, that was a loan which should only be granted if their is a high probability for a career at the end of the degree (i.e., return on investment), which is not the case in Australia.   Now we come to another matter; people leaving Australia and returning.  The Australian government essentially takes on the responsibility/risk of infection IF they allow for people to leave the safety of the country. They have granted a passport and also allow for processing in Airports and other entry/exit points. By granting a release from the country, they should be aware that they've increased the risk of infection, because a citizen should have every right to return to their homeland.   So, ultimately, the cost of quarantine should not fall at the feet of the individual, but rather on the nation. We all pay taxes as a price of living, as such we all benefit in some way or another from said taxes. To think of those people returning from a dangerous situation overseas as selfish is naive, because you are not aware of what these people may be able to offer the country itself. You are also essentially putting those people into poverty to return to safety, when in all honesty, Australia is one of the richest countries and least populous countries in the world and can certainly afford it.   If you were in danger and alone in a foreign land, would you not look to a countryman for help if you could?",australia,t5_2qh8e,/r/australia/comments/o5wyku/queensland_health_to_call_in_debt_collectors_over/h2qm0mg/

That being said there are alot of issues revolving around the vaccine that many people are aware of and are in no rush to get the jab.  The ""protection of others"" and ""do it for your family"" is not necessarily 100% correct, you can still catch the virus and spread the virus, while your symptoms might be non existent or less it can still spread that be at a lower level.

I have also said the vaccination rate would be way less then what is being reported on the news, and it is.

More recently, Mastercard [developed a program called Trust Stamp](https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2020/signed-sealed-encrypted-this-digital-id-is-all-yours/), a platform to verify the identity of participants in online transactions using their biometrics.

143,0,1621295264,"&gt;What is unreasonable about the position I have stated?  Two things, actually.  First, evidence suggests that even if 100% of the population was vaccinated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, herd immunity would still not be achieved because the [R0 of the virus would be greater than 1](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20210125/Herd-immunity-to-SARS-CoV-2-may-not-be-achievable-with-current-vaccines.aspx). The Pfizer vaccine may allow herd immunity, but if you factor in the new varients you have to start vaccinating children (n.b. the vaccine has not been tested on children) or be willing to allow children to get infected, which may not be wise because even in the young 18-39 age group, [nearly 30% of cases, including mild or asymptomatic cases, resulted in long-haul COVID symptoms](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20210219/a-third-of-covid-survivors-have-long-haul-symptoms).  Second, and this is more generally about why you might be downvoted, but you presuppose that opening borders in the near term is essential or desirable to the general population. In the absence of an explicit reason, the reasons that would naturally come to mind to a skeptic are not great: too many trolls argue openly based on macho bullshit (e.g. we can't huddle in the corner like weaklings forever) or selfishness (e.g. I want to go on holiday), so people are naturally primed against you. Then again, providing a reason to open the borders that will convince a significant amount of the population is harder than you might think, considering that [only 57% of the population has a passport](https://www.passports.gov.au/2019-20-passport-facts) and there's less reliable surveys that indicate about [40% of the population have never even gone overseas](https://nowfinance.com.au/knowledge-base/articles/survey-shows-40-of-australians-never-travel-overseas), so the border closures don't really affect their plans anyway. Economic arguments are difficult to buy, as essential travel and transport of goods has always been allowed, and whilst most affected sectors (tertiary education and tourism) make up a bit under 10% of the workforce each, there's little overlap between these groups and the aforementioned 40% of Australians who couldn't or wouldn't leave even if everything was normal.",australia,t5_2qh8e,/r/australia/comments/neroqy/derryn_hinch_this_morning_on_sunrise/gyiawd5/

The reason they are blamed is simple.   1. The government said to come home ASAP in March LAST YEAR. 2. The government has said to rethink (read as don't do it) overseas travel 3. The government has warned of border closures (prior to doing them) 4. The people that are over seas have either remained overseas after the warning, or left after they knew the possible consequences.   This isn't a surprise.  If when covid hit, the government closed the borders before telling people to come home, and since then there hasn't been 1000's of flights coming into Australia with people returning home then I would agree the government is at fault. But the simple fact is that despite so much opportunity and the prior knowledge of risks they have made a choice to stay overseas and now pay the price of that. The risk to everyone isn't fair because of their mistakes.  Not to mention, there are a large number of people in India right now that have dual passports (Indian and Australian), they are using their Indian passport to leave Australia for reasons that don't meet the requirements under government recommendations. They then get stuck overseas and demand as they are Australian citizens that they be repatriated home.

153,0,1615796470,"The Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, told Australians last week ( https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/australia-on-track-for-full-vaccination-by-october-morrison-20210309-p5790b ), that they had until October 21 to get vaccinated.  The PM did not elaborate on what the consequences would be for those who failed to meet that deadline ( https://theconversation.com/a-covid-vaccine-passport-may-further-disadvantage-refugees-and-asylum-seekers-155287 ), but a new Bill before Parliament, together with other statements made by the government recently, holds the clue.  The National Cabinet is currently working on its plans for a new “Digital Vaccine Passport” that will be mandatory for anyone wanting to travel overseas. An announcement on the rollout is expected within the next couple of weeks. The passport will provide proof of vaccination and mean that Australian citizens wishing to travel overseas will be required by law to provide evidence of vaccination or they will not be allowed to board ANY airline.  According to the Government Services Minister ( https://minister.servicesaustralia.gov.au/media-releases/2021-02-19-get-ready-your-vaccination-link-your-digital-government-services ), Stuart Robert, there are a number of vaccine apps the Government is considering, including CommonPass ( https://commonpass.org/ ), the creepy new app designed by The World Economic Forum ( https://commonpass.org/ ).  The aim is for the Digital Pass to, over time, be expanded ( https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/07/freedom-and-fairness-covid-vaccine-passport-plans-cause-global-unease ) to include a whole range of activities and places, from sports stadiums, gyms, schools and universities, to theatres and possibly even workplaces.  “Immunity passports promise a way to go back to a more normal social and economic life,”, the Scientific American has said. ( https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-make-immunity-passports-more-ethical/ ) Someone may want to let the Commonwealth Health Minister know about that, because according to the Health Department’s website:  “COVID-19 vaccination is not a cure-all or a complete substitute for safe behaviour. It should supplement other public health rules and guidelines. After you are vaccinated, COVID-safe measures remain in place. These include:​  - testing  - contact tracing  - quarantine  - isolation”.   Wait, what? So even if we are vaccinated, nothing changes?  Whatever your views are on the Covid-19 vaccine, any policy or laws that will divide a population between ‘the vaccinated’ and ‘the unvaccinated’ must surely ring alarm bells for anyone who cares about the future of this country.  Divisions like that will swiftly lead to a quasi ‘caste’ system, where one group will become a ‘favoured’ class, enjoying privileges and rights denied to a ‘pariah’ class of ‘untouchables’ who would, by any measure, become the most discriminated against group in Australia’s history.  Already, there are signs that the media are quietly readying themselves for attack against these new ‘refuseniks’ who, for whatever reason, decide they are not willing to submit and hold firm to that stance.  Sign the petition and force a debate on the floor of parliament.  There is currently a Petition running, but it is due to end in two days, on the 17th of March 2021.

There are currently 14,207 signatures, but if we can manage to make it to 20,000 signatures, the House of Representatives will be forced to debate the new laws on the floor of Parliament and hopefully make them at least have to submit it to a Senate Inquiry first.
