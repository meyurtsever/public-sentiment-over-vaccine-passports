31,0,1630462351,"&gt;My sentiment comes from the fact that someone I know who has underlying medical conditions and is at risk with vaccinations, will be excommunicated from society, even as her doctor advised her not to get vaccinated yet, so why would the government go against the mind of a qualified doctor on health issues? Is it me or does this simply not make sense?  If you have a medical dispensation against getting vaccinated, then that's fine.  Right now everything is a WIP. Our NSC is not a very agile body and you can see policies and guidelines being issued are slow or at times contradictory.  Yes, it sucks if you're strongly discouraged from being vaccinated and not being able to do certain things that those who have are - i.e. dining in, visiting certain locations et al.  But this is government. Government is not nippy and swift. In time I'm sure the guidelines will be issued for those who have not been vaccinated on medical advice.  On the other hand we have the other side. Takut, I heard my neighbour's second cousin's best friend's acquaintance died after being vaccinated, it's my body and my right to decide what goes into it! So many reasons. Sure.  But guess what, you don't live in a bubble. If you decline to be vaccinated for reasons such as those directly stated in the above paragraph, you're being selfish. Yeah, I'm sure I'll get brickbats for this comment but let's face it. We are in a D I S A S T E R situation. There is no reset button. There is no load save game button.  If you don't want to tango, then don't expect others to switch from the tango to the cha-cha because that's what you want to dance. (everyone else is tango-ing)  Eventually you're going to get to a situation where establishments have a choice and not merely following government guidelines. I work in a restaurant. The restaurant has a right to refuse service to you.  Even if the government says ""Okay! Everyone can dine in!"" and the restaurant CHOOSES to say, ""Sorry. Only those fully vaccinated can come in, please show your MySejahtera vaccine certificate as proof."" there is nothing you can say to overrule that. Sure you could take me to court if you like, but that again is your prerogative. Who knows, you might win after all, but then again, you might lose.  Likewise, shopping malls can say, ""Vaccinated only!"" and why is this? Because it's not a public space is it? It's a private establishment.  The only locations you can probably visit assuming restrictions are lifted are government establishments. Want to go makan, watch a movie, enjoy a theme park?

If like that, where's the value in that service? I don't receive any more information than what the vaccine certificate tells me; I got two doses.
