Just like public transport is allowed to operate only at 50% capacity but they failed to mentioned that which capacity they are talking about, i.e the one recommended by the manufacturer which would deem all the buses in sindh as unusable or the recommended when it was fit to operated i.e 20-30 people or the capacity at which they are operated at i.e 100-120 people....
