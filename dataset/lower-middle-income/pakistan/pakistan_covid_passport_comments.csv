Then using a paper clip attach a photocopy of front and bank of the CANDIDATE'S Pakistani ID card. Make sure that the ID Card number and name is the same as on the document, else make a new account and repeat it with correct details. Also attach 2 passport size photos of candidate.  Once you have the correct documents with paper clip, head to the nearest Standard Charted bank (Make sure that it is Standard Charted as British Council DOES NOT ACCEPT ANY OTHER BANKS). Ask for a form for the British council registration. It will have four pages with an envelope attached. Fill the pages and put the documents you brought in the envelope. Deposit the cash with a teller. He will take the envelope and give you the yellow and one other colour form back. Remember to keep these payment forms safe till your result. You may now leave the bank.  You will get an email from British Council in a few weeks with a payment successful receipt.  Then in a few weeks you will receive an email with your provisional Statement of Entry (and possibly Venue Letter), check these for mistakes and if they have any call the British Council phone number.  Then, if you have such a subject, you may also get an exemption email. It will most likely link to a Microsoft Form. Fill this form if you're taking an exemption.  Then you'll get another email confirming your exemptions. Check that this is correct.  Then IA you will get a final email with your statement of entry, venue letter (clash letter if you have a have an exam clash) and Covid SOPs Guide. Print your SoE in yellow paper if you're under 18 and white if you're above 18. Print your clash letter in white paper.  Check the dates and take your SoE, ID Card, (clash letter if applicable) Stationary and Mask ONLY on exam day.   After exams, keep checking your email around July and you will receive an email with a Login ID and Password. Use this information to login to [https://myresults.cie.org.uk/](https://myresults.cie.org.uk/) on the result day mentioned in the email. You will also receive an OFFICIAL CERTIFICATE by mail a few weeks after this. The envelope will contain a Statement of Results and a Certificate. Keep both these documents.

4,0,1634420198,"Well, Turkey is where every Pakistani loves to go - takes about a couple of weeks to get the visa. Spain, Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland have started serving visas for Pakistanis recently (without Schengen due to Covid). Albania is also a great option. Kenya another one. Egypt. Uzbekistan has also been seeing quite a few Pakistani tourists recently. Maldives and Seychelles for your island vacation.    If you are a travel enthusiast, I'd suggest to join a Facebook group called The Travel Diary. It's a Pakistan focused group so you will get all the opinions from the perspective of a Pakistani passport holder, unless mentioned otherwise. You can make your complete travel itenary there, while getting feedback from recently travelled Pakistanis.",pakistan,t5_2qh89,/r/pakistan/comments/q9ffej/travel_as_a_pakistani_passport_holder/hgwps1t/
5,0,1634208181,"Hi! I'm an American who lives and works in Pakistan and just recently flew back into Pakistan.   For the most part, Pakistani immigration is very easy to navigate. Due to Covid-19, however, you will need a negative PCR test 72 hours from your initial departure and the Pass Track App downloaded with your information filled.   Upon disembarking the plane, they'll first check your Pass Track app. Then you'll head to the immigration counter, hand the agent your passport and NICOP/Visa, who in turn will check your documents and take your picture with a Webcam.   Before baggage claim, you may also under go another rapid antigen test (similar to PCR nasal swab). Have your NICOP/Visa, passport, and passtrack app on hand when you disembark the plane.   Hope this helps. If you have a NICOP and don't look like a foreigner, the immigration agents don't ask too many questions.",pakistan,t5_2qh89,/r/pakistan/comments/q7oknf/traveling_alone_as_a_female_to_pakistan_any_tips/hglgutz/
6,0,1631366612,"I understand your frustration but not everything is a conspiracy theory against Pakistan. Yes, there’s practically no travel between India and Pakistan but I was in Dubai back at end of April when things were getting out of hand in India, When I was flying back to Pakistan via the Fly Dubai terminal, hundreds of Indians and Pakistanis were seated together awaiting their respective flights and interacting with each other. If people aren’t taking our COVID numbers seriously, it’s because our government lacks credibility around the world not because it’s some ploy to ostracize us.   Ukraine is notorious for treating Pakistanis with a lot of contempt upon arrival because several Pakistanis who travel there only do so they can flee in to one of the bordering countries.   I was supposed to visit Russia this summer to attend a Euro cup game. Had my ticket and everything lined up. Was super excited. Guess what ? I didn’t end up going because a lot of people flying in from Pakistan ended up getting detained and being sent back. Among these were 18 or 19 year olds who had shown up with a mere hundred dollars on them not thinking they’d be vetted by immigration. What was their real purpose of travel ? The airline I was traveling with announce they weren’t to going to fly people to Russia traveling on the basis of Fan ID.   I know how it feels to be in your shoes having traveled frequently on a Pakistani passport. But it’s just the card we were dealt. We have to rise above it rather than blame others.",pakistan,t5_2qh89,/r/pakistan/comments/pltdwt/im_depressed_that_the_random_bs_in_neighboring/hcfkrs0/
7,1,1631388408,"1) I'm so confused about the prestige of an Estonian medical degree, aren't their universities not even in the top 100? I know multiple Pakistani lecturers (with degrees from Pakistan) teaching at top 100 institutions, I personally studied from one. Don't stress about ""prestige,"" it's not Oxbridge or Ivy (which aren't special anyway, I have multiple colleagues from there and it didn't help them any more than me!)  2) Research point is fairly valid, however, you can always apply to do research after undergrad (and research degrees generally pay you to do them). I can personally confirm that I've seen multiple researchers from no-name universities, everywhere.  3) I don't have ADHD but I've lived in Europe and the medical care is quite good, albeit, most countries are similar (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, etc.) This is important when making a decision on where to study because all these places offer those benefits too.  4) True, you can provide a comfortable living for them doing just about anything abroad though. Medicine is expensive and takes quite a long time (you'll need to fund yourself until the $$$ rolls in).  5) A Pakistani passport isn't a burden, I've actively tried to keep mine because this passport is a part of my identity. You bite the hand that feeds you?  6) While it's good to be ambitious, Pakistan doesn't particularly need doctors more than, let's say, water security or agriculture workers.  My point being, you weren't born in South Sudan, we have fantastic universities in Pakistan that offer a wide range of degrees (many of which, lead people abroad anyway). While it's unfortunate Covid has delayed your education, you have many options (delay for a year, alternative location, alternative degree, etc.) and Estonia isn't going anywhere.  Take a breather and look at the wider picture.",pakistan,t5_2qh89,/r/pakistan/comments/pltdwt/im_depressed_that_the_random_bs_in_neighboring/hcgxhlt/

Go there and stay for a 12 days to be on the safe side as someone I know got caught out with the timings via Turkey and that was an expensive mistake.

Then proceed with your documents and passport for submission at your nearest Gerry's office.   They usually take around 3-4 weeks to process it (non-urgent) and you'll get an email and maybe a phone call when your passport is ready for collection from the office.,pakistan,t5_2qh89,/r/pakistan/comments/nnsqea/what_is_the_process_for_getting_a_tourist_visa_to/gzwhk7t/

As far as people go liberal Turks are more likely to dislike us while right wing Turks are more likely to like us. Reddit is more left leaning so on subs like r/TurkeyJerky you’ll see them shitting on us. When I went in person they were really nice to the point that it was suffocating.

12,0,1613700071,"This has also been discussed extensively on the Indiamike forums.  If you are an Indian citizen (not OCI), then your wife can get a long term X visa to stay in India.    If you are a non-Indian citizen, then your wife will need to do one of two things: apply on her Pakistani passport, or renounce her Pakistani Citizenship and then apply on her US passport.  I have heard of both situations being successful (yes they ask about your parents and grandparents, but some people have still been successful).   However, using a Pakistani passport will likely be more trouble, and the visa will have more restrictions (list cities where you can go, etc)  Due to covid, I am not sure if any non-essential visas are being issued so you may not have any options right now.",pakistan,t5_2qh89,/r/pakistan/comments/lm5gio/dear_neighbors_has_anyone_here_applied_for_a/gnyk9g0/
